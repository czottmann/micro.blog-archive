			 <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I built a <a href="https://github.com/czottmann/linearis">CLI tool for Linear.app with JSON output, smart ID resolution, and optimized GraphQL queries; designed for LLM agents and humans who prefer structured data.</a></p>
<hr>
<p>I use <a href="https://linear.app">Linear</a> daily, in all my projects. It just such a nice piece of thoughtful software. It&rsquo;s fast, well-laid out, flexible without being overwhelming, and respectful of my time both as a planner and a dev. And it looks good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the anti-JIRA.</p>
<p>The last few months I&rsquo;ve <em>also</em> been using Claude Code, <a href="https://github.com/sst/opencode">sst/opencode</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush">charmbracelet/crush</a> a lot. (Primarily CC.) And naturally, during that time, I wanted to be able to tell the agent to work on this ticket or update that ticket, so I used <a href="https://linear.app/docs/mcp">the official Linear MCP server</a>. It worked great, no complaints.</p>
<h2 id="the-problems">The Problem(s)</h2>
<p>Then one day I discovered the <code>/context</code> command in Claude, Code which gives a nice overview of what&rsquo;s currently occupying its memory. Of the available 200k tokens, roughly 13k were taken up by the Linear MCP server alone – just by connecting and providing its tool definitions.</p>
<p>Now 13k tokens isn&rsquo;t much if you&rsquo;re working with models that have million-token context windows (hello, Gemini Pro). But when you&rsquo;re dealing with 100k or 200k token limits, that&rsquo;s a significant chunk of your available context – gone before you even start doing actual work.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I realized that I am only using maybe three or four tools out of the 20+ that the Linear MCP server offers. Why spend tokens on project-management and workspace-setup features when I&rsquo;m never going to use them? On top of that, I can&rsquo;t use that MCP server in shell scripts.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="my-solution-linearis">My Solution: Linearis</h2>
<p>I finally decided to scratch my own itch and build something focused on what I <em>actually</em> do with Linear on the command line and in agent prompts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create and update tickets</li>
<li>Add comments and labels</li>
<li>Search and filter issues</li>
<li>Manage ticket relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t do in these contexts is project management, workspace creation, or administrative setup. That stuff I handle manually in the UI when needed.</p>
<p>So I wrote <a href="https://github.com/czottmann/linearis">Linearis</a>, a CLI tool for Linear.app with JSON output, smart ID resolution, and optimized GraphQL queries. I designed it for LLM agents and humans who prefer structured data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a command-line tool that outputs JSON, resolves ticket IDs smartly, and sips keeps token usage light.</p>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="using-linearis-in-a-llm-agent">Using Linearis in a LLM agent</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s <strong>agent-friendly by design.</strong> The key idea was making it dead simple for LLM agents to understand and use the tool:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">linearis usage
</code></pre></div><p>This single command returns comprehensive yet concise usage information for all available tools. Agents can pipe this directly into their context and immediately understand everything the tool can do.</p>
<p>The flags and options are well-documented and consistently structured, so agents can easily call it through their Bash tools without any special integration.</p>
<p>So I put this in my <code>CLAUDE.md</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We track our tickets and projects in Linear (<a href="https://linear.app">https://linear.app</a>), a project management tool. We use the <code>linearis</code> CLI tool for communicating with Linear. Use your Bash tool to call the <code>linearis</code> executable. Run <code>linearis usage</code> to see usage information.</p>
<p>The ticket numbers follow the format &ldquo;ZCO-<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;. Always reference tickets by their number.</p>
<p>If you create a ticket, and it&rsquo;s not clear which project to assign it to, prompt the user. When creating sub-issues, use the project of the parent ticket by default.</p>
<p>When the the status of a task in the ticket description has changed (task → task done), update the description accordingly. When updating a ticket with a progress report that is more than just a checkbox change, add that report as a ticket comment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably overly verbose, I guess. 😉 Some examples for prompts I use daily:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;we&rsquo;re working on ABC-1234 now&rdquo;</em></li>
<li>later: <em>&ldquo;add a progress report to the ticket&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;mark ABC-2345 as &lsquo;in progress&rsquo;&quot;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;make this a sub-issue of ABC-3456&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;mark ABC-4567 as a bug&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Linearis for a while now, both manually and with my agentic tools. It does exactly what I need it to do without the overhead I don&rsquo;t need. The agents can create tickets, update them, add comments, and manage labels efficiently. And when I need to do project setup or workspace management, I just use Linear&rsquo;s web UI.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best tool is the one that doesn&rsquo;t try to do everything – just the things you actually need, done well. Linearis solves my particular requirements, but I think it might be helpful to you, too.</p>

			 <p>I finally pulled the trigger on booking the Danish language course (level A1) at our fine local Dansk Centralbibliotek 🎉</p>
<p>2 weeks, 40h – the &ldquo;pressure-cooker&rdquo; version to get started!</p>
<p>Why? Well, Denmark is right around the corner, we moved here 3+ years ago, and at this point, me still not being able to speak the language feels rude somehow. 😉 Also, it opens up opportunities. I mean, we&rsquo;re still toying with the idea of moving farther North. Who knows?</p>

<p>Hosting your newsletter on Substack or posting on X says <em>&ldquo;I am fine with my Nazi neighbours&rdquo;</em>. Because that&rsquo;s what these platforms are: <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Nazi_bar">Nazi bars</a>, run by right-wing people and fascists.</p>
<p>Using them as a creator means that <strong>you are actively helping them</strong> grow and succeed. Your brain power and creations are propping up their Klan crosses.

<p>And for that I do judge you. Yes, I might dig your personal blog or tech newsletter or whathaveyou, but you are part of the problem. Both those things can be true.

<p>Because the thing is: <strong>There&rsquo;s no reason anymore to use those bad actors and their platforms.</strong> You do not have to. Yes, we heard your arguments about reach and whatnot, but right now, a big ass portion of your reach is bot accounts and fans of fascism.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> There are a great many viable alternatives for pretty much all your use cases, including <a href="https://bsky.app">social</a> <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">media</a> and <a href="https://ghost.org">blog + newsletter hosting</a> – and believe me, among your friends, readers, and followers there are folks who will help you move.

			 <p>Sometimes the best software comes from scratching your own itch. That&rsquo;s definitely the case with <a href="https://actions.work/barcuts">BarCuts</a>, my take on a <strong>contextual macOS Shortcuts launcher.</strong> What started as a personal annoyance turned into a proper little utility that I&rsquo;m genuinely proud of – and it&rsquo;s been quite the journey getting here.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-that-started-it-all">The Problem That Started It All</h2>
<p>Picture this: you&rsquo;ve got dozens of Shortcuts workflows on your Mac. Some are for processing files in Finder, others for grabbing URLs from Safari, maybe a few for formatting text in your notes app. But they&rsquo;re all just sitting there in the Shortcuts app, or worse: in Shortcuts' own menu bar, mixed together in one giant list with no context about when you&rsquo;d actually want to use them.</p>
<p>I kept thinking: wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if the right workflows just appeared when you needed them? Like, when I&rsquo;m in Finder, show me my file-processing workflows. When I&rsquo;m in Safari, Chrome, Edge, or another browser, show me <a href="https://actions.work/browser-actions">my web-related ones</a>. Context-sensitive launching, basically.</p>
<p>Turns out, that&rsquo;s exactly what I ended up building.</p>

<h2 id="what-barcuts-brings-to-the-table">What BarCuts Brings To The Table</h2>
<p>As an example, let&rsquo;s pretend you have a Shortcuts workflow named &ldquo;Get today&rsquo;s appointments&rdquo; which fetches your appointments from the calendar, and which you only ever need when working in Notes. Here it is in the Shortcuts editor:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You want this workflow to be available in BarCuts whenever the Notes app is in front. So you&rsquo;ll find the floating panel titled &ldquo;BarCuts Tagger&rdquo; next to the window, and &ldquo;tag&rdquo; Notes as a related app to this Shortcuts workflow, as shown above.</p>
<p>Now, BarCuts' menu will list the workflow when Notes is the frontmost app:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And that&rsquo;s all there is to it!</p>
<p>The menu can be opened with the mouse, but you can also configure a global hotkey that will open it, in the app&rsquo;s Settings tab. Alternatively, you could also hook up <a href="https://actions.work/barcuts">BarCuts</a> to Alfred, or connect it to your Raycast.</p>
<h2 id="timeline-or-everythings-a-journey-now">Timeline, or: Everything&rsquo;s A Journey Now</h2>
<h3 id="prototype-actions-based-tagging">Prototype: Actions-Based Tagging</h3>
<p>My initial approach was pretty straightforward (and, in hindsight, a bit naïve). I created a special Shortcuts action called &ldquo;BarCuts Tagger&rdquo; that you&rsquo;d add to your workflows. You&rsquo;d configure it with the app you wanted to associate the workflow with — say, &ldquo;Finder&rdquo; — and BarCuts would watch for when that app was active and surface the relevant workflows in its menu bar.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It worked! The concept was solid, and I was pretty pleased with the initial implementation. Little did I know there was a significant problem lurking that I wouldn&rsquo;t fully appreciate until later&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="the-public-beta">The Public Beta</h3>
<p>In February 2025, two weeks after starting the project, I <a href="https://forum.actions.work/t/barcuts-public-beta/604">launched the public beta</a>, and the initial feedback was encouraging! People got the concept and found it useful.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, I properly <a href="https://forum.actions.work/t/barcuts-2025-1-0-launch/621">launched version 2025.1</a>. 🚀</p>
<h3 id="version-20252-a-reality-check">Version 2025.2: A Reality Check</h3>
<p>But as I was working on version 2025.2, I started hearing from more users about a problem I hadn&rsquo;t fully grasped initially. To be honest, most of my own tagged workflows are macOS-only anyway, so I rarely ran into the sharing or iOS compatibility issues that were frustrating other people.</p>
<p>I realized there was this massive, glaring problem with my original approach: your workflows were no longer &ldquo;clean.&rdquo; They had this Tagger action cluttering them up, which meant:</p>
<ul>
<li>You couldn&rsquo;t share them with anyone who didn&rsquo;t have BarCuts</li>
<li>They&rsquo;d throw errors on iOS (where BarCuts obviously doesn&rsquo;t exist)</li>
<li>Your beautiful, <em>artisanal</em> workflows suddenly had this extra cruft in them</li>
</ul>
<p>My practical approach turned out to be the opposite of elegant.</p>
<p>Despite this workflow pollution issue, I kept working on BarCuts because the core concept was still solid. <a href="https://forum.actions.work/t/barcuts-2025-2/650/1">Version 2025.2 was all about &ldquo;connectivity&rdquo;</a>: I added proper scripting support, built companion extensions for <a href="https://docs.actions.work/barcuts/alfred/">Alfred</a> and <a href="https://docs.actions.work/barcuts/raycast/">Raycast</a>, and included a CLI tool for my fellow automation nerds.</p>
<p>Because a launcher like that shouldn&rsquo;t be a closed system. If you prefer launching workflows from Alfred or Raycast instead of the menu bar, great – you should be able to do that and still get the contextual filtering that makes the app useful.</p>
<p>I also finally got around to writing <a href="https://docs.actions.work/barcuts/">proper documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="version-20253-polish-and-fixes">Version 2025.3: Polish and Fixes</h3>
<p>Better settings, fixed some annoying bugs, improved the workflow execution system. The kind of update that doesn&rsquo;t look like much from the outside but makes everything feel more solid and reliable.</p>
<p>During that time my old #1 problem was rearing its fugly head again: building the software is actually the easy part. Getting people to notice a new Mac utility? That&rsquo;s the real challenge. Turns out there are <em>lots</em> of great apps that barely anyone knows about because, well, <strong>marketing is hard.</strong> Who knew?</p>
<p>I was trying to get the tech news and pundits interested in earnest. Nobody cared. 🫤</p>
<h3 id="version-20254-the-present">Version 2025.4: The Present</h3>
<p>And that brings us to <a href="https://forum.actions.work/t/barcuts-2025-4-the-clean-workflows-update/713">the latest update</a>, which I&rsquo;m genuinely excited about because it finally got around to solving that nagging workflow pollution problem I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>I completely replaced the old Shortcuts action approach. Instead, BarCuts now adds a floating &ldquo;BarCuts Tagger&rdquo; panel directly to the Shortcuts editor. When you&rsquo;re editing a workflow and BarCuts is running, you&rsquo;ll see this lovely little panel floating next to your workflow window:</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the nice bit: your workflows remain &ldquo;clean&rdquo;. No more BarCuts actions. You can share them with anyone, run them on iOS, whatever – they&rsquo;re just normal Shortcuts workflows, as they should be. Lesson learned.</p>
<p>To tag a workflow now, you open it in Shortcuts and use the floating panel to tag it to whichever apps you want. You can even tag a single workflow to multiple apps if it&rsquo;s useful in different contexts. Or put it in a submenu for even more structure.</p>
<p>All existing tagged workflows get migrated automatically, and if you still have old BarCuts actions lying around, the app will help you clean them up.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works-today">How It Works Today</h2>
<p>The current BarCuts experience is dead simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the app and grant it the necessary permissions</li>
<li>Open any workflow in Shortcuts</li>
<li>Use the floating panel to tag it to relevant applications</li>
<li>Switch to one of those apps, and your tagged workflows appear in the BarCuts menu bar</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. No actions to configure, no workflows to modify, no compromises on shareability.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>
<p>Look, I know there are lots of ways to launch Shortcuts workflows. Spotlight search, the Shortcuts app itself, various launcher apps – they all work fine for what they do.</p>
<p>But BarCuts does something different: it surfaces the <em>right</em> workflows at the <em>right</em> time. When you&rsquo;re in Finder and want to process some files, you don&rsquo;t want to see your Safari bookmarking workflows cluttering up the list. When you&rsquo;re writing in Notes, you want your text-processing workflows front and center, not your photo editing ones.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s about reducing cognitive overhead.</strong> Instead of remembering which workflow does what and hunting through lists, the relevant ones just appear when you need them.</p>
<p>And now, with the floating panel approach, you get all that contextual goodness without any of the workflow pollution that was holding people back.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a proper backlog of ideas for future updates. Keyboard shortcuts for the menu, bulk workflow configuration, maybe some deeper integration with other automation tools – the usual <em>&ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if…&quot;</em> stuff that keeps me up at night thinking about software.</p>
<p>But for now, I&rsquo;m pretty chuffed — <em>chuffed!!</em> — with where BarCuts has ended up. The core concept is the same as when I started, but its implementation is cleaner now.</p>
<h2 id="give-it-a-whirl">Give It a Whirl</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a macOS Shortcuts user who&rsquo;s ever felt overwhelmed by a growing collection of workflows, BarCuts might be worth a look. There&rsquo;s a 14-day trial, no strings attached, and the app works with macOS 14 and later.</p>
<p>You can download it from <a href="https://actions.work/barcuts">the website</a>, and if you want to chat about automation or share your setup, the <a href="https://forum.actions.work/c/barcuts/12">ActionsDotWork Forum</a> is full of friendly folks who love this stuff as much as I do.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday, I finally got around to moving <a href="https://forum.actions.work/">my Discourse forum</a> to a new hoster. The last two years I had it running at <a href="https://www.communiteq.com">Communiteq</a> – rock-solid, but the (reasonable!) $50/month is more than I am willing to keep spending on a <em>very</em> low-traffic forum.</p>
<p>So I looked into a couple of hosting companies and, in the end, decided to go with <a href="https://pikapods.com">PikaPods</a>. It&rsquo;s a European outfit (Malta); I like what they have on offer, and my stuff resides in the EU. They provide managed hosting not just for Discourse but for all kinds of apps. The idea there is that you pick an app you&rsquo;re interested in (e.g., Discourse, FreeScout, Bugsink, <a href="https://www.pikapods.com/apps">plus many others</a>), and they set it up for you. Fully automated, they recommend a vCPU/RAM/storage config, and after about five minutes, you have a fresh instance. If you decide it needs more juice, you adjust vCPU/RAM/storage, the pod reboots, and you&rsquo;re good. Really good pricing, too.</p>
<p>I like that concept a lot.</p>
<p>The move itself was surprisingly painless – which was delightful not last because I really wasn&rsquo;t looking forward to it. (Hadn&rsquo;t done it before; was expecting hassles.) The PikaPods account creation was straightforward, the pod setup was super simple, and my one support request got a helpful reply within the hour. Very nice.</p>
<p>So my first-day experience: excellent.</p>
<h2 id="disabling-parts-of-discourses-message-bus">Disabling (parts of) Discourse&rsquo;s message bus</h2>
<p>Today, I ran into an issue with Discourse&rsquo;s message bus which made repeated requests to <code>/message-bus/*/poll</code>. They would regularly take up to 25s (!), and when that happened I could see the page loading stall. Not cool.</p>
<p>Why is that happening? If I understand it correctly, this forum feature uses long-polling and sort of saturates the HTTP connection pool of my little instance in the process. As a remedy, the good people on the official Discourse message board suggested throwing more CPU at the problem, but I&rsquo;d rather not – I&rsquo;d really like to keep things small around here.</p>
<p>So, to decide on a course of action, I read up on what the <code>poll</code> endpoint does. What would happen if I disabled those calls? Apparently this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users won&rsquo;t see new posts without manually refreshing</li>
<li>Notifications won&rsquo;t update in real-time</li>
<li>The forum feels &ldquo;static&rdquo; rather than live and interactive</li>
<li>Multi-user editing and collaboration features break</li>
</ul>
<p>Aha! So nothing I need, got it.</p>
<p>A bit later, after more research and tinkering, I arrived at a working solution: a tiny JS in the site&rsquo;s head that brute-forces stopping the message bus:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">pollStopperInterval</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">setInterval</span>(
  () =&gt; <span style="color:#a6e22e">Discourse</span><span style="color:#f92672">?</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">__container__</span><span style="color:#f92672">?</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">lookup</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;service:message-bus&#39;</span>).<span style="color:#a6e22e">stop</span>(),
  <span style="color:#ae81ff">2000</span>
);
</code></pre></div><p>Very good, and now my Discourse instance runs <em>fine</em> with 3 vCPUs and 8 GB of RAM. And I have yet to encounter any issues.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://zottmann.org/2025/06/13/how-to-use-google-gemini.html">How to use Google Gemini in Xcode 26 beta</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://zottmann.org/2025/06/13/how-to-use-google-gemini.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-06-13 11:27:02 &#43;0200">Jun 13, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over on Mastodon, someone<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> asked whether it&rsquo;s possible to use Google&rsquo;s Gemini in the new Xcode 26β on macOS 26 beta. It is!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Well, with some creative proxy scripting, that is.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#rest">offers an OpenAI-compatible API for Gemini</a>, and while working, it is not what Xcode expects in terms of URL layout. In Xcode&rsquo;s LLM provider config, the custom &ldquo;URL&rdquo; parameter is the API&rsquo;s base URL up to <strong>but not including</strong> the <code>v1/</code> path segment, e.g. <code>https://api.openai.com/</code> instead of the full <code>https://api.openai.com/v1/</code>. When making calls to the provider later on, Xcode will automatically append the endpoint path (e.g. <code>v1/models</code> etc.) to that URL.</p>
<p>Now, the Gemini URL structure breaks with the <code>v1/</code> convention: its URL is <code>https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/</code> instead of <code>https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/</code>. You can see why this might be a problem.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how to set up both Xcode and a proxy app to use Google&rsquo;s offerings.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-setting-up-gemini-in-xcode">Step 1: Setting up Gemini in Xcode</h2>
<p>Go to Settings → Intelligence → Add a Model Provider, then fill out the form as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Internet Hosted</li>
<li><strong>URL:</strong> <code>https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/</code></li>
<li><strong>API Key:</strong> <code>Bearer $apiKey</code> (the latter being the actual API key)</li>
<li><strong>API Key Header:</strong> <code>Authorization</code></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Whatever, I set it to &ldquo;Gemini&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Click &ldquo;Save&rdquo;, quit Xcode.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-setting-up-request-rewriting-using-proxyman">Step 2: Setting up request rewriting using Proxyman</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to transform the requests into the right shape using a local rewriting proxy. Here, I&rsquo;m using the excellent <a href="https://proxyman.com">Proxyman</a>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Download and install it. (I won&rsquo;t go into the details of the setup, as it&rsquo;s both straightforward and well-enough documented on their website.)</p>
<p>(You could also use <a href="https://freshbits.fi/apps/proxygen/">Proxygen</a> for that; I just picked Proxyman because I&rsquo;m familiar with it.)</p>
<p>Once it&rsquo;s running, I made it proxy all app-level Xcode requests, then enabled and configured <a href="https://docs.proxyman.com/scripting/script">Proxyman&rsquo;s scripting capabilities</a> to rewrite the requests on the fly.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="the-proxyman-script-config">The Proxyman script config</h3>
<p>URL: <code>https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/</code>. Process all HTTP methods, and include all subpaths of this URL. Script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">onRequest</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">context</span>, <span style="color:#a6e22e">url</span>, <span style="color:#a6e22e">request</span>) {
  <span style="color:#a6e22e">request</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">path</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">request</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">path</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">replace</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/v1/&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/v1beta/openai/&#34;</span>);
  <span style="color:#a6e22e">request</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">color</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;yellow&#39;</span>;
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">request</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>This will rewrite any Gemini calls to <code>/v1/…</code> to the correct Google API path.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-checking-the-list-of-gemini-models">Step 3: Checking the list of Gemini models</h2>
<p>Open Xcode again, go into Settings → Intelligence → Gemini. It should now display the list of available models:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="step-4-using-gemini-in-xcode">Step 4: Using Gemini in Xcode</h2>
<p>For this, I created a new Swift app, went into the <code>ContentView.swift</code>, and told Gemini 2.5 Flash to <em>&ldquo;Make it German, add two buttons (&ldquo;Much AI&rdquo;, &ldquo;So Gemini&rdquo;)&quot;</em>. And it did!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
<ul>
<li>Proxyman has to be active alongside Xcode for this procedure to work. This may or may not be desirable, depending on your machine and overall setup.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s possible that in future Xcode betas, Apple will allow more customization when it comes to LLM providers. Fingers crossed!</li>

			 <p>macOS 26β is out, and so is Xcode 26β with LLM support. Unfortunately, I couldn&rsquo;t get any of it to run as the beta refuses to allow me to use Apple Intelligence – because apparently <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/VirtualBuddy/discussions/524#discussioncomment-13426024">Apple Intelligence isn&rsquo;t available in virtual machines at all</a>? Wild. But not being able to set up Apple Intelligence means not being able to use the ChatGPT models in Xcode 26β which is one of its main draws for me.</p>
<p>Well, along comes <a href="https://simonbs.dev/posts/using-claude-with-coding-assistant-in-xcode-26/">Simon Støvring with a helpful blog post</a>, showing that you can make the app use your Anthropic models! Thanks, mate 🤙🏼</p>
<p>Naturally, I tried to get both OpenAI and OpenRouter working with my own keys, and after inspecting the network traffic and fiddling with the parameters I managed to get it partially working.</p>
<p>&lt;img style=&ldquo;display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&rdquo; src=&ldquo;<a href="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2025/screenshot-2025-06-11-at-11.55.45.png%22">https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2025/screenshot-2025-06-11-at-11.55.45.png&quot;</a> alt=&ldquo;Screenshot of Xcode 26β, Settings window, Intelligence tab, showing a populate &ldquo;OpenAI&rdquo; entry which lists a lot of OpenAI models&rdquo; title=&ldquo;Screenshot 2025-06-11 at 11.55.45.png&rdquo; border=&ldquo;0&rdquo; width=&ldquo;808&rdquo; height=&ldquo;557&rdquo; /&gt;</p>
<h3 id="my-findings-lest-i-forget">My findings, lest I forget</h3>
<p>The &ldquo;URL&rdquo; parameter is the API&rsquo;s base URL (must be OpenAI-compatible) up to (but not including) the <code>/v1</code>, e.g. <code>https://api.openai.com/</code> instead of <code>https://api.openai.com/v1</code>.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;API Key&rdquo; parameter is the API key your provider gave you, e.g. <code>sk-whatever</code>; the &ldquo;API Key Header&rdquo; parameter is <code>x-api-key</code>. But:</p>
<p>If the provider in question uses the HTTP <code>Authorization</code> header to check the API key, we&rsquo;re in luck: The &ldquo;API Key Header&rdquo; can also be set to <code>Authorization</code> – and in that case, Xcode will <strong>automatically</strong> prefix the API key with the string &ldquo;Bearer&rdquo;, e.g. <code>Bearer sk-whatever</code>.</p>
<p>&lt;img style=&ldquo;display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&rdquo; src=&ldquo;<a href="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2025/screenshot-2025-06-11-at-11.53.53.png%22">https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2025/screenshot-2025-06-11-at-11.53.53.png&quot;</a> alt=&ldquo;Xcode 26β&rsquo;s &ldquo;internet hosted model provider&rdquo; form, with data as described in the text above.&rdquo; title=&ldquo;Screenshot 2025-06-11 at 11.53.53.png&rdquo; border=&ldquo;0&rdquo; width=&ldquo;843&rdquo; height=&ldquo;576&rdquo; /&gt;</p>
<p>So I got OpenAI support working even without Apple Intelligence configured. OpenRouter, not so much: my guess is that OpenRouter&rsquo;s list of available models is just too damn big for Xcode at this point. TBF, it&rsquo;s a humongous list.</p>
<p>Thanks again to Simon for the pointer!</p>
<p><strong>Update 2025-08-04:</strong> Got a message from reader Tanveer M. about OpenRouter: there&rsquo;s <a href="https://openrouter.ai/docs/community/xcode">Xcode Integration | OpenRouter | Documentation</a> now. Nice.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When life gets rough, it&rsquo;s easy to become sarcastic or cynical, but I realized a long time ago that that&rsquo;s not healthy at all. In a way it&rsquo;s like really having to pee when you&rsquo;re in a swimming pool with other people (bear with me). You could be blasé about it, and every time there&rsquo;s a bitter laugh about the situation, you pee a tiny bit. It&rsquo;s a big pool, right? No harm done. And everyone else is doing it too! Easy.</p>
<p>Yet do it often enough, you&rsquo;ll end up submerged in piss.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could say, <em>&ldquo;I gotta pee&rdquo;</em>, and get out and go to the bathroom like an adult.</p>
<p>In my opinion, that&rsquo;s the much healthier option most of the time. It&rsquo;s not always easy, but what is? Not being cynical or sarcastic, but being open and honest about an issue takes guts. It&rsquo;s often uncomfortable but <em>knowing</em> that we&rsquo;ve been true to ourselves is a load-bearing component of our moral foundations.</p>
<p>Because cynicism and sarcasm are poisons that poison the person who dishes them out. They&rsquo;re not vents, they&rsquo;re just terrible feedback loops.</p>
<p>Just something I thought about for no reason. Have a great Thursday, y&rsquo;all.</p>

<p>It was simpler times.</p>
<hr>
<p>🎤 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1214603-gary-gulman-born-on-3rd-base">Gary Gulman: &ldquo;Born on 3rd Base&rdquo; (2023)</a> – For me personally, a funnier special than his previous two.</p>
<p>🎮 <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/powerwash-simulator/9NHDJC0NW20M/0010">PowerWash Simulator | Xbox</a> – I have no excuse. I liked it a lot for some reason. At some point my mind turned this game into part 2 of the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody%27s_Gone_to_the_Rapture">Everybody&rsquo;s Gone to the Rapture</a>. You&rsquo;re alone and hallucinating conversations with ghosts and other people that you never see, while cleaning what they have left behind.</p>
<p>📚 <a href="https://trevor-hopkins.com/banks/dark-matter-index.html">Trevor Hopkins: &ldquo;Dark Matter&rdquo;</a> – A fan fiction Culture novel, and I gotta say, this worked very well for me. If you miss Iain M. Banks as much as I do, and long for new Culture stories, check out Mr. Hopkins' catalogue!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/parenting/article/we-only-learnt-of-our-sons-secret-online-life-after-he-died-at-20-rj3bqfnqn">We only learnt of our son’s secret online life after he died at 20</a> – <em>&ldquo;When Mats Steen died from a muscle-wasting disorder, his parents believed that his life had been a tragically lonely one — until hundreds of emails from strangers arrived. It turns out that he’d found friendship and even romance in a gaming community&rdquo;</em>. I&rsquo;ve cried a little bit reading that article.</p>
<p>🎮 <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/C4Z7QM8FSXM2">Hellblade: Senua&rsquo;s Sacrifice | Xbox</a> – Looks and sounds fabulous, but I&rsquo;ve dropped the game after a few hours; I just can&rsquo;t deal with its whole <em>everything</em> right now.</p>
<p>🎤 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1079003-kurt-braunohler-perfectly-stupid">Kurt Braunohler: &ldquo;Perfectly Stupid&rdquo; (2022)</a> – Good stand-up special from a comic I hadn&rsquo;t heard of before.</p>
<p>🎮 <a href="https://www.sifugame.com/">Sifu</a>, Xbox – A lovely Kung Fu game. I love the idea, I love the look, I lack the skill.</p>
<p>🎮 <a href="https://donutcounty.com/">Donut County</a>, Xbox – Short, sweet, cute game where you play a hole in the ground, mostly. I liked it!</p>
<p>🎤 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/429797-tom-papa-human-mule">Tom Papa: Human Mule (2016)</a> — Two weeks later, I don&rsquo;t remember anything from that hour, though. But I <em>know</em> I enjoyed it while it lasted.</p>

<p>🎤 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfMEIPLJyrk">Steve Hofstetter: &ldquo;Secret Optimist&rdquo;</a> – Hilarious stand-up special. Time well spent.</p>
<p>🎤 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-fAi7tBKyI">Steve Hofstetter: &ldquo;The Recipe&rdquo;</a> – Excellent, very personal stand-up comedy special. This one had me lightly tear up once or twice. I love comics that tell personal stories, not just jokes.</p>
<p>📚 <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/35776828">Phoebe_Zeitgeist: &ldquo;Standard Operating Equipment&rdquo;</a>, Archive of Our Own – A short fan fiction story, placed in the late, great Iain M. Banks' Culture universe. The bar is high; Banks made sure of that with his original works. This one did really well, I think.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihKWii5B7u8">Noland Arbaugh, First Human w/ Neuralink Implant Tells His Story</a> – A supercut version of Noland Arbaugh&rsquo;s <a href="https://neuralink.com">Neuralink</a> session where he talks about his experience of being the first person to receive an actual Neuralink brain-computer interface device, which lets him control his iPad and play games, all with his mind. Nolan&rsquo;s quadriplegic since an accident several years ago. For a moment, ignore who set up that company, how much of a thundercunt their CEO is, etc. Concentrate on listening to Arbaugh talk about his work on &amp; with Neuralink – it&rsquo;s crazy inspiring and mindboggling. Just awesome technological progress, really.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_gJp2uAjO0">The Race to Harness Quantum Computing&rsquo;s Mind-Bending Power | The Future With Hannah Fry</a>, YouTube – Super interesting look at what&rsquo;s going on in quantum computing, for normal&rsquo;ish people.

		<a href="https://zottmann.org/2024/11/07/fears-and-thoughts.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-11-07 12:21:01 &#43;0200">Nov 7, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Some things I believe might happen in the next few years, in response to the utterly insane 2024 US election that went to Trump. I just want to get this shit out of my head onto another canvas so it doesn&rsquo;t circle around in my brain the entire time. I need to <em>function</em>, and that ever-present feeling of doom and dread doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Preface: These are just the high-level thoughts my brain spit out. Don&rsquo;t get me started on the emotional, person-level fears I have for the <em>human beings</em> who&rsquo;ll have cruelty inflicted on them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that said:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trump has no interest in doing any work, and he&rsquo;s on his last leg, so this will turn into a quasi-Vance presidency quickly.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll get reliable proof that there was some heavy Russian election interference going on, including hacking of voting systems. The ruling US fascists won&rsquo;t follow-up on this because they got what they wanted.</li>
<li>If everyone is bending the knee before the new king, there won&rsquo;t be any more &ldquo;checks and balances&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The US will mostly withdraw from NATO, or at least meet its obligations with indifference.
<ol>
<li>Russia will intensify its war efforts in Ukraine because Trump has already stated he doesn&rsquo;t care, so … free reign, less backup for Ukraine.</li>
<li>This will embolden China to invade Taiwan because it knows Trump doesn&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->care<!-- raw HTML omitted --> understand. Taiwan no longer being a free country will also have the side-effect of the World&rsquo;s biggest chip foundry being Chinese all of a sudden.</li>
<li>Russia will start fucking with the other countries which declared their independence from the fallen Soviet Union.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The other NATO members will (hopefully) stick together, because they understand what&rsquo;s on the line, namely Europe. Several countries will re-introduce mandatory service (looking at my home country Germany here).</li>
<li>The GOP will continue their good work on building a well-functioning<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> mafia state where everything is beholden to the don, using the successful Putin blueprint. This will take decades to undo, if ever.</li>
<li>Britain at least seriously <em>considers</em> re-joining the EU.</li>
<li>Climate protection is no longer on the table for the US. They left the Paris climate accord right after Trump&rsquo;s 1st term started, and they&rsquo;ll do the same again. The US gov&rsquo;t will curtail the powers of the EPA (again), with renewed vigor, or shut it down entirely.
<ul>
<li>Remember in 2017, when the US government agencies <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/07/usda-climate-change-language-censorship-emails">weren&rsquo;t allowed to even mention climate change on their websites</a>?</li>
<li>Thankfully, renewables have proven themselves in terms of generating money, so that might make it harder to shut down in favor of fossil fuels etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a given that the climate crisis will worsen, the US will be hit hard, there&rsquo;ll be some major disasters. (Same thing all around the World.) The US gov&rsquo;t fascists have already killed off a ton of crisis response departments at that point (&ldquo;small government!!&quot;), so the responses won&rsquo;t be enough, and there&rsquo;ll be rioting. Remember hurricane Katrina? That, but not just once, and much worse.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>At the moment of this writing,</strong> half the US population is comfortable with Project 2025, a Russian-style mafia state oligarchy, and the <em>&ldquo;every man for himself&rdquo;</em> mentality (which is notably not gender-neutral). So where does that leave the other half? I cannot imagine them being accepting of this direct assault on their human rights and core values. Because from what I can tell, they fundamentally reject the <em>&ldquo;survival of the fittest&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;know your place&rdquo;</em> principles that underpin the GOP&rsquo;s authoritarian agenda. Currently, there are laws that address injustices, and courts to handle such matters, but what if <em>that</em> changes due to partisan reconstruction of the legal system?</p>
<p>I certainly think that there&rsquo;s a lot of civic unrest on the table for the US. It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if the king would get his wish of the military keeping the order – on which side, who knows.</p>
<p><strong>But for the rest of the world, too, this election changes a lot of constants.</strong> I certainly hope my home (the EU) gets its shit together, and finally creates a strong, unified, economic <strong>and</strong> military defense force soon.</p>
<p>Big sigh.</p>
<p>On a <strong>very personal level</strong>, here&rsquo;s is what makes my skin crawl the most:</p>
<p>My grandma lived through World War II, her family was decimated by the German Nazis. My parents and I were born and grew up in the former East Germany, a satellite state of &ldquo;big brother Russia.&rdquo; The latter was not terrible by any stretch, but it was <strong>not</strong> freedom. I do not want to see the day when autocratic Russia seeks to return to its imagined former glory by invading its old territories.</p>

			 <p>A roundup of noteworthy things I’ve played, read, listened to, or watched over the last few weeks.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was surprised myself, but I spent several hours watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@outsidexbox">outsidexbox&rsquo;s videos and live streams on Youtube</a>. Just what the doctor ordered: A great team of adults with good chemistry, playing games I don&rsquo;t want to play but enjoy watching, bantering. Entertaining.</p>
<p>🎥 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/577922-tenet">Tenet (2020)</a> — Late to the party as usual, but I&rsquo;ve enjoyed that weird-ass movie quite a bit. Bit of a brain twister story, well executed!</p>
<p>🎶 <a href="https://tidal.com/browse/album/369298410?u">Rakim: &ldquo;G.O.Ds NETWORK - REB7RTH&rdquo;</a> – If you&rsquo;re in the market for good, new, old school hip hop by one of the greats, I can recommend this EP. It just clicks with me, hard.</p>
<p>📺 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/128798-infiniti">Infiniti (2022)</a> — This 6-part, French scifi mystery series came out of nowhere for me. Part murder mystery, part Baikonur space drama, I really liked it. If you&rsquo;re kinda bored by the same-same of US/UK SF shows, it might be worth your while. Different pace, different setting, different way to tell a story.</p>
<p>🎥 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/376659-bad-moms">Bad Moms (2016)</a> – Surprisingly funny. Didn&rsquo;t expect anything, and it delivered a good number of laughs.</p>
<p>🎤 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bdoNmVtOU">Steve Hofstetter: &ldquo;Me, Myself, and ID&rdquo;</a> – A really good, super-solid, somewhat political comedy special. Hofstetter&rsquo;s delivery is on point on several levels. And for me it had a number of laugh-out-loud moments! (A)</p>
<p>🎤 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1227770-taylor-tomlinson-have-it-all">Taylor Tomlinson: &ldquo;Have It All&rdquo; (2024)</a> –  Tomlinson is good, I like her comedy a lot. To me, her style of comedy feels like <em>&ldquo;working things out on stage&rdquo;</em>, and I&rsquo;m here for that. (See also her earlier special <em>&ldquo;Quarter-Life Crisis&rdquo;</em>.)</p>
<p>🎤 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1269935-my-next-guest-with-david-letterman-and-john-mulaney">My Next Guest with David Letterman and John Mulaney (2024)</a> – Two of the greats. Mulaney appears to be so much more …<em>grounded</em> these days, which actually makes me happy for him.</p>
<p>🎥 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/725201-the-gray-man">The Gray Man (2022)</a> – Perfectly fine action flick with Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans' mustache. Nothing to write home about but well done. I won&rsquo;t forget it anytime soon, however, only because I watched it on a hotel room Samsung smart TV, and that screen&rsquo;s picture &ldquo;optimizations&rdquo; made the whole movie look like a cheap-ass telenovela, which angered me far more that is reasonable.</p>

			 <p>A roundup of noteworthy things I’ve played, read, listened to, or watched over the last few weeks. Busy times, so I kind of forgot about this list, so I&rsquo;m trying to reconstruct it from memory. Which, incidentally, is a good yard stick! If I can remember it, it obviously was &ldquo;noteworthy&rdquo;, right? That&rsquo;s just science, people.</p>
<hr>
<p>🎥 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/746036-the-fall-guy">The Fall Guy (2024)</a> – Loved it. The whole movie just worked for me. Jolly good fun!</p>
<p>📺 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105666/star-wars-the-acolyte-trailer-premiere-date-disney-plus">Star Wars: The Acolyte</a> – Slow start. Didn&rsquo;t look like the usual Disney SW (&ldquo;shovel ware&rdquo;) in the beginning, which was nice. Over the course of the season, it became …muddled, to the point of feeling, well, pointless. My current pet theory (one that I hate having, mind) is that in season 2 the new power couple is gonna make a force baby which will one day become Emperor Palpatine. Disney&rsquo;s Star Wars, where anything not related to Episode I-VI goes to die. I think I&rsquo;m finally over filmic entertainment involving lightsabers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-05-16/neuralink-s-first-patient-describes-living-with-brain-implant">Who Is Neuralink&rsquo;s First Patient? Noland Arbaugh on His Brain Implant - Bloomberg</a> (<a href="https://archive.is/20240516164215/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-05-16/neuralink-s-first-patient-describes-living-with-brain-implant">Archived</a>) – Noland Arbaugh became the first human to receive Neuralink&rsquo;s brain-computer interface implant. The device allows him to control a computer with his thoughts, overcoming his physical limitations after a tragic accident left him paralyzed. Ignore everything &ldquo;Elon Musk&rdquo; in this article, and focus on the technological marvel on display. Super cool stuff.</p>
<p>🎮 <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-survivor">STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor™</a>, Xbox GamePass Ultimate – Cal Kestis is back, baby! Bit of a slow start for me, but then it clicked just like Fallen Order did. Turns out I&rsquo;m a Single+Blaster stance type of guy, I didn&rsquo;t expect that. The serious⟺silly spread is pretty wide, though. On one hand, you have epic Jedi/ fate/ betrayal stuff, on the other, Space Cowboy Kermit 🐸</p>
<p>📺 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/93784-tales-from-the-loop/season/1">Tales from the Loop: Season 1 (2020)</a> – Slow, ponderous, weird-ass stories from a time and place that never were. They captured the 80s/90s look exceedingly well, and paired it with some believable machine design, there&rsquo;s much to love about it. Watched the first few episodes. As I&rsquo;ve said, they&rsquo;re slow but good; not very dense, but they were given a sensible amount of space to develop and breathe. Like it.</p>
<p>📚 <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/1b770ff6-9676-4c0f-8d35-00fa14e68967">Arthur C. Clarke: &ldquo;Rendezvous with Rama&rdquo;</a> – After hearing again and again how much of an influential masterpiece it is, I finally decided to pick it up for the first time. Got three chapters in on the last days of July. We&rsquo;ll see!</p>
<p>🎮 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/519182-despicable-me-4">Despicable Me 4 (2024)</a> – Did laugh a lot. I like that series, unadulterated silly fun, and there&rsquo;s just something about Steve Carell doing Gru that cracks me up every time.</p>
<p>🎶 <a href="https://tidal.com/browse/album/239661357?u">Chase &amp; Status: &ldquo;More Than Alot&rdquo;</a> – Catching up on my 2008+ drum&rsquo;n&rsquo;bass. Good music to work to, with &ldquo;Against All Odds (feat. Kano)&rdquo; being a solid standout.</p>
<p>🎤 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1080787-nate-bargatze-hello-world">Nate Bargatze: Hello World (2023)</a> – Super-enjoyable comedy special by one of the current greats. I&rsquo;m a fan of NB since I first came across <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/590872-nate-bargatze-the-tennessee-kid">The Tennessee Kid (2019)</a> years ago, and subsequently worked my way through his back catalog. Hilarious on so many levels.</p>

			 <p>A roundup of noteworthy things I’ve played, read, listened to, or watched over the last few weeks. In May, we were on vacation in Sweden in celebration of our respective birthdays, and I still am/was working a lot on my <a href="https://actions.work/ui-actions">new macOS app, UI Actions</a>. (Which is coming along quite nicely, thank you!)</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-04-18/redwood-material-s-nevada-ev-battery-recycling-facility-attempts-to-rival-china">Redwood Material&rsquo;s Nevada EV Battery Recycling Facility Attempts to Rival China - Bloomberg</a> (<a href="https://archive.is/20240418184950/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-04-18/redwood-material-s-nevada-ev-battery-recycling-facility-attempts-to-rival-china">Archive</a>) – Recycling FTW. But this venture there, man! Staggering numbers, really hard for me to visualize. Very, very cool. <em>&ldquo;While the toll of mining the raw materials for batteries is considerable, more than 95% of the key minerals can be profitably recycled. At Redwood, nothing goes to landfill, and no water leaves the facility except the sanitary waste from sinks and toilets. There are no gas lines; everything is electric. It’s also built for scale, allowing the company to quickly break down a truckload of assorted batteries without manual sorting or tedious disassembly.&quot;</em></p>
<p>🎤 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paxFZLYJwaY">Fern Brady: &ldquo;Power &amp; Chaos&rdquo;</a>, YouTube – Standup special by Scottish comedienne Fern Brady. Loved it. I&rsquo;m man enough to admit I had to use CC every now and then. 😅</p>
<p>🎤 <a href="https://tidal.com/browse/album/75161120/u">Fern Brady: &ldquo;Male Comedienne&rdquo;</a> – After seeing &ldquo;Power &amp; Chaos&rdquo; I had to check out her other stuff, too. I&rsquo;m ESL, and while she&rsquo;s sometimes hard to understand (because Scottish is beautiful but also very much its own thing) she&rsquo;s never <em>not</em> funny.</p>
<p>📺 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/203085-star-wars-tales-of-the-jedi">Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi</a> – Nice yet forgettable, like most SW stuff these days. I&rsquo;d take one more episode of <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/83867-star-wars-andor">Andor</a> over this any day.</p>
<p>📚 <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/356bf1c5-317c-424d-bc78-45a9faa88d86">&ldquo;Altered Carbon&rdquo; by Richard K. Morgan</a> – Re-read. Still a very, very tight and satisfying cyberpunk novel.</p>
<p>🎤 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE6px74gY1c">Aaron Woodall: &ldquo;No One Pretends To Be Religious&rdquo;</a> – Stand-up special by a former Mormon. I mention this because he himself is riding that &ldquo;ex-Mormon&rdquo; train <em>hard</em> here but it didn&rsquo;t do much for me.</p>
<p>🎶 <a href="https://tidal.com/browse/album/360759578?u">&ldquo;Radical Optimism&rdquo; by Dua Lipa</a> – An unsurprisingly<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> upbeat album, musically. Nice.</p>
<p>🎮 <a href="https://www.starwars.com/games-apps/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> – Started getting into this one at the end of the month. I&rsquo;m not too far in, just left the first tutorial planet. I hope it&rsquo;ll be as satisfying an experience as its predecessor, Fallen Order.</p>

			 <p>A roundup of noteworthy things I’ve played, read, listened to, or watched over the last few weeks. Not much, this time; I am/was working a lot, <a href="https://actions.work/ui-actions">new macOS app and all</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LateNightSeth">Late Night with Seth Meyers on YouTube</a> – Love it. When he talks about &ldquo;jackals&rdquo;, I feel wholly included, which either tells you everything you need to know about my sense of humor, or nothing at all.</p>
<p>🎤 <a href="https://tidal.com/browse/album/338655462">&ldquo;Live (At the Time)&rdquo; by Demetri Martin</a> – I had a blast listening to this stand-up special, but it&rsquo;s a different form than what I&rsquo;m used to. It&rsquo;s basically just a more or less random list of hilarious observations and one-liners; this description makes it sound more disjointed than it actually is. Good stuff.</p>
<p>🎮 <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny">Destiny 2</a> – After 2+ years of absence, I picked up the so-called &ldquo;Legacy Collections&rdquo;, containing yester-years' three big DLCs (Shadowkeep, Beyond Light, The Witch Queen), and am solo&rsquo;ing my way through them. It&rsquo;s still Destiny, for sure, even though they&rsquo;ve changed a lot over the years. I&rsquo;m having fun, 15€ well spent. I&rsquo;m currently in the first chapters of the Witch Queen DLC, and it&rsquo;s pretty nice! Haven&rsquo;t decided yet whether to buy Lightfall after that, or The Final Shape.</p>
<p><a href="https://theoutline.com/post/7886/ursula-le-guin-carrier-bag-theory">We should all be reading more Ursula Le Guin | The Outline</a> – I love the idea, the whole mindset. <em>&ldquo;The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction […] disputes the idea that the spear was the earliest human tool, proposing that it was actually the receptacle. Questioning the spear’s phallic, murderous logic, instead Le Guin tells the story of the carrier bag, the sling, the shell, or the gourd. In this empty vessel, early humans could carry more than can be held in the hand and, therefore, gather food for later. Anyone who consistently forgets to bring their tote bag to the supermarket knows how significant this is. And besides, Le Guin writes, the idea that the spear came before the vessel doesn’t even make sense.&quot;</em> I need to check my local library  for some of ULG&rsquo;s books.</p>
<p>📚 <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/876fb0d6-74cb-4636-a93c-9f43a8585c0c">&ldquo;Leave the World Behind&rdquo; by Rumaan Alam</a> – What a courageous book. As in: I think it takes a certain kind of courage to call it a day when your book is only 2/3 done. It wasn&rsquo;t a terrible read, but I felt like it was making promises all the time it couldn&rsquo;t keep. Both book blurbs and the related movie trailer made it sound quite VanderMeer’ian – I was expecting some New Weird, but it isn&rsquo;t that. In fact, I&rsquo;m not sure <em>what</em> that book even wants to be. There&rsquo;s a lot of spooky foreshadowing both by the narrator (&ldquo;the trees knew&rdquo;, &ldquo;old folks know&rdquo;, &ldquo;kids can hear ghosts&rdquo; etc.) and dramatic plot points (people getting sick etc.), and nothing. comes. of. it. And then it ends. It just ends.  (C)</p>
<p>🎤 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UwA31_X16E">&ldquo;People Make Mistakes&rdquo; by J.F. Harris</a>, YouTube – Hilarious stand-up special.</p>
<p>🤘🏼 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mxg4VkkRRI">Live In Texas (Full) - Linkin Park</a> — Linkin Park&rsquo;s 2003 live performance. Always worth a rewatch.</p>
<p>📺 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/287689-7-days-in-hell">7 Days in Hell (2015)</a> – Tennis is deeply weird. Also, ~30 mins is the right length for a piece like this. Hilarious if you&rsquo;re a bit weird and/or like Samberg mockumentaries (like &ldquo;Popstar&rdquo;), probably unwatchable otherwise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@storror">STORROR on YouTube</a> – Every Monday, like clockwork. I like watching their training and challenges etc., they&rsquo;re an enjoyable bunch. If you haven&rsquo;t watched their film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKl2Yj3qqQs">&ldquo;Roof Culture Asia&rdquo;</a> yet, I recommend it if you&rsquo;re interested in parkour.</p>

			 <p>A roundup of noteworthy things I’ve played, read, listened to, or watched over the last few weeks. A bit late, as usual, so … not really late.</p>
<hr>
<p>📚 <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f098bed4-73f0-4586-9225-a0a4df111b91">&ldquo;Childhood&rsquo;s End&rdquo; by Arthur C. Clarke</a> – A classic scifi work, new to me. Enjoyable, and painted in broad-enough strokes to not feel super-old. I love reading these really old foundational works and then discovering their clear influences in other novels, movies, stories that came later.</p>
<p>🧩 <a href="https://londji.com/en/puzzles/gravity-puzzle.html">&ldquo;My little World&rdquo; Round Puzzle by Londji &amp; Cinta Vidal</a> – Not strictly media, but D and I did spend an inordinate amount of time on this beautiful, circular, 500-piece jigsaw puzzle. Very meditative. Loved it. (A+)</p>
<p>🎤 <a href="https://tidal.com/browse/album/304759520">&ldquo;Shocks &amp; Struts&rdquo; by Kyle Kinane</a> – Fun stand-up set by Kinane. Did LOL a few times. (A)</p>
<p>📺 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/103516-star-trek-strange-new-worlds/season/2">Star Trek: Strange New Worlds: Season 2 (2023)</a> – Something about SNW just feels <em>right</em>. Is it the simple one-story-per-episode structure? Is it Anson Mount&rsquo;s fabulous hair, or Melissa Navia&rsquo;s equally rad cut? The chemistry between the people on set? I don&rsquo;t know, but it just works. We&rsquo;re still in the middle of S02, and enjoying it a lot. (A)</p>
<p>🎮 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorus_(video_game)">Chorus</a> – A space shootybang. Tight control, great presentation, but it just didn&rsquo;t click with me. Apparently I&rsquo;m not the kid anymore who played the <em>shit</em> out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_(video_game)">Descent</a> et al.</p>
<p>🎮 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everspace_2">Everspace 2</a> – Another space looter-shooter. See Chorus, above.</p>
<p>🎤 <a href="https://tidal.com/browse/album/246380665">&ldquo;Greatest Bits, Vol. 1&rdquo; by Kathleen Madigan</a> – Super-solid standup set by a comedian I had never heard of before. I had fun! (B+)</p>
<p>🎮 <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horizon_zero_dawn_complete_edition">Horizon Zero Dawn™ Complete Edition</a> – I&rsquo;ve almost 100%&rsquo;d HZD on my PS4 Pro a few years back. I loved everything about it so very much. Since I don&rsquo;t have a PS4 anymore, I decided to pick it up on GOG for PC, and give it a shot on my MacBook (M1 Pro) using <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/">Heroic Games Launcher</a> and <a href="https://getwhisky.app/">Whisky</a>. I was surprised how relatively painless the installation is and how well it runs, even with everything set to High or Ultra. (A+)</p>
<p><a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com">Clarkesworld Magazine</a> – I enjoy their <em>&ldquo;Let me read you a story&rdquo;</em> podcast, so I figured I&rsquo;d go and pick a couple of their short stories at random. Here are a few that stood out to me:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/nagata_07_16_reprint/">&ldquo;Nahiku West&rdquo; by Linda Nagata</a></li>

			 <p>A roundup of noteworthy things I’ve played, read, listened to, or watched over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>It was a busy month, and I didn&rsquo;t have much time for reading a book or playing some games. It happens. March is going better already. 😉</p>
<hr>
<p>🎙️ <a href="https://danielsloss.com/streaming/socio/">&ldquo;Socio&rdquo; by Daniel Sloss</a> – Funny stand up special by a funny Scotsman, a bit crass at times, enjoyable. I liked his earlier specials a bit more; I think it has something to do with him not being as professionally self-assured as he is now, if that makes any sense.</p>
<p><a href="https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/maps-distort-how-we-see-the-world">&ldquo;Maps Distort How We See the World&rdquo; by Tomas Pueyo</a> – Absolutely mind blowing. The most-used map projection entirely distorts the size of continents, countries, the poles. Just take a look at the first correction (a GIF) in the article!</p>
<p>📚 <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/71c1071b-9904-4ed7-9c32-c806d95c8be7">&ldquo;Acceptance&rdquo; by Jeff VanderMeer</a> – The eerie conclusion to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Reach_Trilogy">VanderMeer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Southern Reach&rdquo; trilogy</a>. Good read, adding quite a bit of depth to many characters. I loved how he threw some curve balls with minor details, like the thing with the old cell phone. Good ending, all in all. (A)</p>
<p>📺 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/52814-halo/season/2">Halo, Season 2, by people who don&rsquo;t give a shit about established lore, I think</a> – I&rsquo;m not fond of this &ldquo;Silver timeline&rdquo; at all (it&rsquo;s called that because, holy shit, it sure ain&rsquo;t gold). I do like Pablo Schreiber&rsquo;s gruff MC, and he&rsquo;s out of armor 90% of the time for some reason. Outstanding: Natasha Culzac&rsquo;s depiction of Riz-028 growing from Spartan into an actual person, that was really good. I hate how they wasted some lore-important Key(es) characters for cheap drama. I don&rsquo;t like the weird-ass <em>&ldquo;human part of the Covenant&rdquo;</em> bollocks. I&rsquo;d love to know what Makee&rsquo;s hair dresser thinks they are doing over there. This show is a bit of a train wreck, but I can&rsquo;t seem to look away. If you have no idea what Halo is or how the original story went, it&rsquo;s probably more enjoyable. (C-)</p>
<p>📺 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDWJ213d2Ucr-3q9LDF9P1_j3Rr3GMJeS">Three-Body: 三体</a> – There is this supposedly very faithful 30-part Chinese TV adaptation of &ldquo;The Three-Body Problem&rdquo; by Cixin Liu. Each episode is over 40 minutes long. They sure take their sweet time with the show, and after four episodes I threw in the towel. It&rsquo;s very well done, I think, but this show is not made for me.</p>
<p><a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2024/02/19/death-lonely-death/">Death, Lonely Death — Crooked Timber</a> – A beautiful ode to the engineering marvel that is Voyager I. Godspeed, little one. You did great.</p>
<p>🎙️ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWmFPa4vL0Y">&ldquo;No Questions Asked&rdquo; by Matt Goldich</a> – He is one of the writers of &ldquo;Late Night with Seth Meyers&rdquo;, which is how I discovered this special. It&rsquo;s not ROFL material to me, but I had a good time! I laughed, and that&rsquo;s always nice. (B)</p>
<p>🎙️ <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5akzmnuKQ9KNisobGyAUfb">&ldquo;The Matt Goldich Guarantee&rdquo; by Matt Goldich</a> – His first album/ special. Good jokes, dry delivery, really liked it! (B+)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/opinion/sunday/tyranny-convenience.html">&ldquo;The Tyranny of Convenience&rdquo; by Tim Wu</a> (<a href="http://archive.today/e8iIX">Archived</a>) – Well-written plea to choose your battles wisely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What happens to human experience when so many obstacles and impediments and requirements and preparations have been removed? Today’s cult of convenience fails to acknowledge that difficulty is a constitutive feature of human experience. Convenience is all destination and no journey. But climbing a mountain is different from taking the tram to the top, even if you end up at the same place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/bao_11_20/">&ldquo;Niuniu&rdquo; by Baoshu, translated by Andy Dudak : Clarkesworld Magazine – Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy</a> – Novelette by Chinese scifi  author Baoshu. What would you do if live took a person you loved, and you could &ldquo;bring them back&rdquo; in a way? A bit depressing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LofSYpT9Z6g">Lone Echo | Full Game Walkthrough | YouTube</a> – A VR game walkthrough. I had heard good things about Lone Echo, but don&rsquo;t own anything that could play it, so I went to YT on a whim. Nice story, well presented.</p>
<p><a href="https://krautreporter-de.translate.goog/politik-und-macht/4934-don-putin-und-seine-feinde?shared=e547c3e4-8838-456c-b320-bea5b0b6de14&amp;_x_tr_sl=de&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">&ldquo;Don Putin and his enemies&rdquo; by Krautreporter</a> – Here&rsquo;s a great &ldquo;Russian govt&rdquo; explainer article from one of my fave German journalist crews, <a href="https://krautreporter.de/botschafter-einladung/fac0d828-ae22-44c7-8b67-2e5d112a2e52">Krautreporter</a>. It was published in German, but Google Translate did a good job, so I wholeheartedly recommend reading and spreading it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Russia has become a mafia state, with a powerful boss at the top: Vladimir Putin. Many of his decisions seem irrational, and many events in Russia seem completely insane, such as Prigozhin&rsquo;s attempted coup. But if you understand Russia as a mafia state, then the coup attempt is a war between two rival gangs. And a lot of other things suddenly make sense.</p>

			 <p>A roundup of noteworthy things I’ve played, read, listened to, or watched over the last few weeks.</p>
<hr>
<p>📺 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/87917-for-all-mankind/season/3">For All Mankind: Season 3</a> – They don&rsquo;t let up! The farther the show goes into speculative territory, the broader it gets. And it felt a bit rushed at times. High points: everything on Mars, even if the timing and logistics of the North Korean capsule don&rsquo;t make sense to me (did they travel from Earth to Mars in that bucket? Seems unlikely). Low points: anything with the Stevens brothers, my goodness. (A)</p>
<p>📺 <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/87917-for-all-mankind/season/4">For All Mankind: Season 4</a> – The world building of this last season is still great, but in terms of stories, I didn&rsquo;t like the distinct feeling of <em>&ldquo;too many arcs, not enough time&rdquo;</em>, as a few threads were left hanging or were buried abruptly (Kelly, anyone?). I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the whole of it, but it was tonally different from the previous seasons. Side note: Ed Baldwin had a somewhat odd character arc, didn&rsquo;t he? At this point, I fully expect him to open a detective agency on Phobos in S05. (B+)</p>
<p>📚 <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/19981172-bb5c-48bb-bbcb-16a1df99e436">&ldquo;Elder Race&rdquo; by Adrian Tchaikovsky</a> – A novella that takes up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws">Clarke&rsquo;s third law</a> nicely. I found the insight into the anthropologist&rsquo;s emotional life and the description of his depression very well realized. (B)</p>
<p>🎶 <a href="https://listen.tidal.com/album/90095665">Mike Shinoda: Post Traumatic (2018)</a> – I think it was his first solo album after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington">Chester Bennington</a>&rsquo;s death, and you can feel a lot of pain. Not an easy listen, even though it is as tight as ever.</p>
<p>📚 <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/fda768e2-65be-43cc-a83e-3dfe4ad15775">&ldquo;Annihilation&rdquo; by Jeff VanderMeer</a> – Weird, very weird. It tells a different story than the movie adaptation, I think. Still, the good kind of weird. (B+)</p>
<p>📚 <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/39bcf921-24b3-4ebf-9338-94f4f0569dc7">&ldquo;Authority&rdquo; by Jeff VanderMeer</a> – The follow-up to Annihilation. It is said that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Reach_Trilogy">VanderMeer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Southern Reach&rdquo; trilogy</a> was a big influence for Remedy, the makers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_(video_game)">the excellent game &ldquo;Control&rdquo;</a> (which I replayed in December), and yeah, I see a lot of parallels. It has a somewhat unsettling feel to it, which I liked a lot. (A)</p>
<p><a href="https://futurecrunch.com/goodnews2023/">66 Good News Stories You Didn&rsquo;t Hear About in 2023</a> – Focussing on what went well, on causes for celebration and hope. It&rsquo;s a good list! (A+)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/23/germany-far-right-alternative-for-germany-afd-reckoning-protest-future/">Germany’s surging far right Alternative for Germany party provokes a reckoning - The Washington Post</a> – I won&rsquo;t lie, it felt good to get out there and finally see that turnout. We are many! Also, the official numbers reported by the police are notoriously too low. In Munich, roughly 200k people showed up, not 100k. Anyways, the far-right&rsquo;s narrative of &ldquo;silent majority&rdquo; is obviously utter bullshit. Don&rsquo;t ever believe their brown hype, people.

<p>🎶 <a href="https://tidal.com/">TIDAL - High Fidelity Music Streaming</a> – Somewhat turned off by the business side of Spotify, I decided to give their competitor TIDAL a try, not least because <a href="https://dittomusic.com/en/blog/how-much-does-tidal-pay-per-stream/">the payout for the streamed artists is apparently quite a bit higher</a> than with other services. It&rsquo;s good, I guess? I kind of miss Spotify&rsquo;s &ldquo;Discover Weekly&rdquo; list, which did a much better job of surfacing music that&rsquo;s new to me. And even if their catalogs are comparable, I feel that in the curation department, Spotify has the upper hand. And navigating from a currently playing song from a playlist to the album feels a bit off to me. In any case, both services ask for €11/month. But artist payout is important to me, so TIDAL it is.</p>

			 <p>A roundup of noteworthy things I&rsquo;ve played, read, listened to, or watched over the last few weeks.</p>
<hr>
<p>📺 <strong><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/67198-star-trek-discovery/season/2">Star Trek: Discovery: Season 2</a></strong> — Hoo boy, that was way, <em>way</em> too much. Everything was on fire, all the time, all at once, everything was at stake yadda yadda yadda. I think if it had 5-10 story arcs less the season would&rsquo;ve been better. I&rsquo;ve realized once again that Disco is not made for me, and that&rsquo;s okay. On the upside, I finally got to see &ldquo;proto-Pike&rdquo;, which answered some question I had when watching ST:SNW. 🖖</p>
<p>📺 <strong><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/103516-star-trek-strange-new-worlds/season/1">Star Trek: Strange New Worlds: Season 1</a></strong> — D and I are finally watching it on TV, together, one episode a week. It was new for her but not for me. She&rsquo;ll never be a Trek fan like me, still, we&rsquo;re both enjoying it. Good times! 🖖</p>
<p>📺 <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(2023_specials)">Doctor Who, 60th Anniversary Specials</a></strong> — It was great seeing David Tennant and Catherine Tate together again! The whole <em>&ldquo;we have two Doctors now&rdquo;</em> thing, though… It <em>reeks</em> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe">MCU</a> and spin-offs, and I do not like that. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I enjoy the whole Whoniverse but (to me) the major appeal is that every two or three years, there&rsquo;s an entirely new cast and a new spin on the old concept. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2023-12/ukraine-internationale-legion-auslaendische-freiwillige-krieg">Internationale Legion der Ukraine: &ldquo;Ich bin komplett alleine hier als Deutscher. Komplett allein&rdquo; | ZEIT ONLINE</a></strong> (<a href="http://archive.today/aV3Y2">full article</a>) — <em>&ldquo;A mover from Brandenburg. A student from Ohio. An activist from Belarus. Three men fight against Russia in Ukraine. Why are they putting their lives at risk?&quot;</em> German-language article about international volunteers fighting for Ukraine against the Russian invasion. Really good, intense read. If you have a way to translate it into your language, I recommend reading it.</p>
<p>🎤 <strong><a href="https://tidal.com/album/315145488">Marc Maron: From Bleak to Dark</a></strong> — He is still bitingly good, but is becoming increasingly friendly/ loving/ mellow with every new album. I like that. The part about his deceased partner made me tear up. Oof.</p>
<p>🎮 <strong><a href="https://www.remedygames.com/games/control/">CONTROL</a></strong> — Re-play on the Xbox. Still sooo good. Style, sound, gameplay, story, everything clicks! Remedy <em>killed it</em> with this game. The Oldest House is one of my happy places. (I might be weird.)</p>
<p>📺 <strong><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/87917-for-all-mankind/">For All Mankind: Season 1 &amp; 2</a></strong> — Hot damn, such a good mix of alternate history, personal drama &amp; stories, and NASA punk. What a timeline!</p>
<p>📺 <strong><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/134403-spice-girls-how-girl-power-changed-britain">Spice Girls: How Girl Power Changed Britain</a></strong> — I stumbled into this 3-part documentary about the pop group (kids, ask your parents), and it was really interesting, even though I never was a big fan. But for a time, they were inescapable, so it was a nice history lesson. Did you know Eddie Murphy had a child with Melanie B but for months denied it was his, until she proved it with a DNA test? I didn&rsquo;t. TBH, I lost a bit of respect for him there.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This day in 2021 was the first day of my 3-month burnout sabbatical.</p>
<p>I had been increasingly overworked for 2-3 years at this point. We were building a sensible and sustainable company, yes, and I was so proud about that. At the same time, I was way too stressed all the time, and was struggling <em>so. fucking. hard.</em> Still, I kept pushing through, day by day, but very often I felt like I was a week away from going Hindenburg 1937. Then, that Friday evening, my good friend and co-founder Florian showed up unannounced at our doorstep, and told me, <em>&ldquo;Buddy, you&rsquo;re pooped. Take a few months off, just get better.”</em> My crew had noticed, he had noticed, and they acted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still very grateful to them.</p>
<p>And the first weeks were brutal. I had such a hard time deciding <em>anything</em>. Answering a simple question like &ldquo;Want some coffee?” was hard. My wife carried my sorry ass for weeks. I had completely drained my batteries which (among other things) were also powering my decision-making processes, which was weird AF.</p>
<p>I remember going for a walk in Munich, and there was a fork in a road — both paths would take me to the same destination. Still, I was unable to choose one of them, and just stood there dumbfounded for a few minutes. Not a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>Anyways. I was <em>able</em> to take my time, I got better, I found out why I was stressed, and ultimately, I came to the conclusion that I had to leave the company I had helped found and loved dearly. I wasn&rsquo;t the right person for that particular job anymore – and <em>my own company</em> wasn&rsquo;t the right fit for me anymore. Which was a sad yet elating conclusion. And a very weird moment of recognition: Like moving out of my parents' house AND being the parent at the same time.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2023: We&rsquo;ve changed many more things, moved way up North, I&rsquo;m an indie dev now, and my wife says I look much better these days. ❤️</p>
<p>Life is pretty good right now is what I&rsquo;m saying. Getting stuck can get you killed, and you&rsquo;re never too old to make some changes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing the dark places you can end up, even when the work is meaningful, the people are great, and there&rsquo;s a real, global purpose. (I had all three of those things: We were building a <a href="https://recup.de">Germany-wide deposit system for reusable coffee cups and take-out containers</a>. Basically a waste reduction system on a gigantic scale. Good, important work on an <em>actual</em> problem.)</p>
<p>An interesting lesson, that.</p>

<p>Short answer: Just like the macOS app, the iOS app is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1659667937">free to download</a> from the App Store. <a href="https://support.actions.work/article/67-how-do-the-trial-periods-work">There is a 14+ day trial period.</a> Afterwards you need a license. Single-platform licenses (iOS or macOS) are $9/ $12/ $15, depending on what you think is a fair price!</p>

<p>I decided against subscription pricing, even though it would have been a better choice financially. But I personally prefer software that I can <em>buy</em> rather than <em>rent</em>, because it gives me independence from the fate of the company that makes it. (Here, I exclude tools that rely on server components which need regular maintenance etc.)</p>
<h2 id="available-world-wide">Available …World-wide?</h2>
<p>Almost. The app is available in 174 out of 175 App Stores — I know it&rsquo;s merely a symbolic gesture, but I&rsquo;ve excluded Russia until they stop their unprovoked war against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Слава Україні! 🇺🇦🖖🏼</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll publish my public roadmap soon; there&rsquo;s a solid backlog of new ideas and feature requests, and I&rsquo;d like my customers to get a glimpse of what&rsquo;s planned for the next versions. I&rsquo;ll keep you posted!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One of my biggest small wins this month: learning how the macOS <code>security</code> CLI tool works. It can store and retrieve Keychain entries:</p>
<p>1️⃣ <code>security add-generic-password -a czottmann -s &quot;My secret API key&quot; -w</code> asks for the PW and stores it.</p>
<p>2️⃣ <code>security find-generic-password -a czottmann -s &quot;My secret API key&quot; -w</code> retrieves and outputs it.</p>
<p>Super useful: if you store a password like this, <code>security</code> automatically whitelists itself for password-less access to that particular password, meaning it&rsquo;s trivial to fetch passwords from the Keychain in scripts.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://zottmann.org/2023/03/22/til-how-to.html">TIL How To Batch-Process Audio Files With Effect Chains</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Every now and then I record an audio file for a tutorial or some such. I always do it in the same place, with the same equipment. And then I have to clean it up using VST/AU plug-ins in a DAW (digital audio workstation).</p>
<p>Today I learned how to automate this process using <a href="https://www.reaper.fm/">REAPER</a>, a very nice, very scriptable, very powerful DAW. Because TIL that <a href="https://github.com/ReaTeam/Doc/blob/master/REAPER-CLI.md">Reaper comes with a CLI</a>!</p>
<p>Basically, the Reaper CLI allows me to call it with a file containing processing instructions. The file must contain both paths to audio files and details about what to do with them. My example file <code>~/Desktop/process.txt</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>/Users/czottmann/Desktop/audio-track-1.wav
/Users/czottmann/Desktop/audio-track-2.wav
&lt;CONFIG
  FXCHAIN &quot;Tutorials.RfxChain&quot;
  OUTPATH &quot;/Users/czottmann/Desktop/processed-tracks/&quot;
&gt;
</code></pre><p>The file paths are pretty self-explanatory, the interesting part is the <code>&lt;CONFIG …&gt;</code> directive. <a href="https://github.com/ReaTeam/Doc/blob/master/REAPER-CLI.md">As described in the docs</a>, I tell Reaper to use an FX chain called &ldquo;Tutorial&rdquo; and save the processed files in <code>~/Desktop/processed-tracks/</code>.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Tutorials&rdquo; FX chain didn&rsquo;t exist, I needed to create it first. So, in Reaper:</p>
<ol>
<li>I imported an applicable audio file into Reaper. (For setting my baseline, the applicable audio file was one of the voiceovers I did for a tutorial.)</li>
<li>I configured the FX chain for that track. Gate, de-esser, compressor etc.</li>
<li>I saved the FX chain using the name “Tutorials” in Reaper&rsquo;s default FX chains directory.</li>
</ol>
<p>And with that done, the CLI could be used:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>/Applications/REAPER.app/Contents/MacOS/REAPER \
  -batchconvert ~/Desktop/process.txt
</code></pre><p>Reaper starts up, does the processing, saves the results in the output folder (which should be created beforehand), and quit once done.</p>
<p>Pretty cool.</p>

<p>Almost. The app is available in 174 out of 175 App Stores — I know it&rsquo;s merely a symbolic gesture, but I&rsquo;ve excluded Russia until they stop their unprovoked war against Ukraine.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<p>I am currently researching actions for working with front matter and for dealing with Obsidian Sync. And it&rsquo;s probably a safe bet that a bug or two will pop up — if you find something weird or need help, just open the app and click the &ldquo;Send Feedback&rdquo; button or the entry in the Help menu.</p>
<p>But first, I want to get the iOS version ready for TestFlight. Stay tuned!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>What I came to understand a few years ago: when it comes to writing software, I love creating &ldquo;visible plumbing&rdquo;. Let me explain.</p>
<p>When I talk about software development, I use the term &ldquo;plumbing&rdquo; to describe backend systems, all the usually invisible infrastructure stuff that makes things work. Sexy headline stuff? No. Important? Absolutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Visible plumbing&rdquo; is the stuff that helps people achieve their goals and do their jobs, like personal automation. (Ex: <a href="https://obsidian.actions.work">obsidian.actions.work</a>).</p>
<p>It may not be shiny, but it&rsquo;s <em>useful</em>.</p>
<p>And that theme, over the years, has come back to me again and again. Helping my co-workers and people get through their day, building automation for/with them, making the machine that was our company hum a little nicer - that&rsquo;s my jam.</p>
<p>As its CTO (= resident nerd), I built a shitload (most?) of <a href="https://recup.de">RECUP</a>&rsquo;s early digital infrastructure and tools, and I was happy with that, even though I knew it was important, but not something that was visible to people outside the company. I never made the cover of a business magazine or gave any interviews about it. But I knew I was doing important work, and that made me happy.</p>
<p>Or go back even further, about 20 years: I ran a community site for an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MMORPG<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (kids, ask your parents) that focused on in-game &ldquo;news&rdquo; and markets. I was that thing that made it easier for others to tell their in-game stories, achieve their goals, have fun. To them, it was useful, and that gave me energy.</p>
<p><strong>Anyway, my point is:</strong> I found my &ldquo;passion&rdquo; (🤮), I realized what gave me joy and what made me tick. I will never be super-rich or super-famous or super-important, and that&rsquo;s quite alright, because I am content with what I do.</p>
<p>As a software developer or entrepreneur or freelancer, you don&rsquo;t have to chase the shiny shit, the VC, you don&rsquo;t have to revolutionize the Whatever, you don&rsquo;t have to go global, you don&rsquo;t need to &ldquo;make it big&rdquo;. Find an area that&rsquo;s important to you, big or small (don&rsquo;t overlook the small things!) and then go do your thing in that area. In my experience, that&rsquo;s a recipe for getting the most joy out of your work.</p>

			 <p>Beim letzten Besuch bei meinen Eltern erzählte mein Vater von einem Bekannten, der auch aus dem Harz weggezogen ist und seit über <!-- raw HTML omitted -->20 Jahren<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in München lebt.  Die Mutter, seine letzte Angehörige, hatte vor einiger Zeit das Elternhaus im Ort verkauft und war in ein nicht weit entferntes Dorf umgezogen.  <em>&ldquo;Das muss ja seltsam sein, wenn man dann so heimatlos ist.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Ummm.</p>
<p>Ich finde nicht, dass er heimatlos ist.  <em>Für mich</em> ist Heimat der Ort, an dem ich lebe und mit dem ich mich verbunden fühle, also mein Lebensmittelpunkt — daher ist <em>für mich</em> diese Aussage falsch.  Ich komme aus dem Harz: als ich dort lebte, war es meine Heimat, für viele Jahre danach war München meine Heimat, jetzt ist es die Förde.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Anders gesagt: &ldquo;Herkunft&rdquo; ist das Dock, in dem mein Boot gebaut wurde und wo es ins Wasser gelassen wurde; &ldquo;Heimat&rdquo; ist der Ort, an dem ich den Anker auswerfe.  Wenn man dort wohnt, wo man geboren wurde, können die Fragen nach Herkunft und Heimat zwar identisch beantwortet werden, aber es sind trotzdem zwei verschiedene Konzepte.</p>
<p><strong>Wenn <em>ich</em> einen Ort als &ldquo;Heimat&rdquo; bezeichne, dann drücke ich damit Commitment aus.</strong> Ich lasse mich voll darauf ein, ich bin hier, ich bin präsent.</p>
<p>Aber wenn z.B. eine schon lange in München lebende Person sagt, ihre Heimat sei Leipzig, klingt das <em>für mich</em> immer nach <em>&ldquo;ich wäre viel lieber in Leipzig&rdquo;</em>. (Egal, ob sie es so meint oder nicht. Und beides ist okay, <em>mind</em>.)</p>
<p>Mich irritiert die sprachliche Unschärfe. 😉</p>

			 <p>Ich weiß nicht, wieviel Zeit ich noch habe.</p>
<p>In den 5 Monaten, die wir jetzt in in Flensburg wohnen, hatte ich bereits einen Hexenschuss <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(in der ersten Woche! Verhoben beim Einzug)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> und COVID <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(inkl. einer harten Erkältung über Wochen hinweg)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, und die letzten zwei Wochen plagte mich auf der linken Seite ein sog. Tennisarm, der meine Zeit mit Schreiben und Programmieren durch Schmerzen hart verkürzte. Diese Probleme wurden am Schreibtisch verursacht durch die Verwendung einer <em>ergonomischen Maus</em> (!!) und verschwinden mittlerweile auch langsam wieder, aber heute morgen zickte dann plötzlich aus heiterem Himmel mein unterer Rücken herum. WTF‽</p>
<p>Wenn das so weitergeht, erlebe ich das nächste Jahr nicht mehr, was ein Drama wäre, schliesslich habe ich gerade erst Tickets für das neue Programm des famosen <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mulaney">John Mulaney</a> im Januar 2023 ergattert. Verdammt!</p>
<p>Mir ist wichtig, dass Ihr Folgendes wisst: War schön mit Euch. 😂</p>
<p>Aber was erwarte ich: ich habe meine Gesamtfitness etwas vernachlässigt im letzten Jahr. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Ich bin zwar jeden Tag sehr viel auf den Beinen und schaffe meine <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8000-10000 Schritte<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, aber Cardio ersetzt halt keine Calisthenics. Auftrag erkannt, Tagesablauf wird angepasst. 🙂 Wird schon wieder.</p>
<hr>
<p>Unrelated: Es ist ja immer etwas <em>weird</em>, Fotos und Stories der Ex-Freundin auf Instagram anzuschauen, kurze Momente eines (jetzt) fremden Lebens zu erhaschen, ihre Urlaubseskapaden mitzuerleben, ihre neuen Partner zu sehen — und klar zugeben zu müssen, dass sie immer noch ziemlich hot ist, dass ihre Trips in die Ferne eigentlich <em>genau. Dein. Ding.</em> sind; dass Du bei jedem verstohlenen Blick ein wenig <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FOMO</a> verspürst. Aber gleichzeitig weißt Du genau, warum Du Dich von ihr getrennt hast, und dass es die richtige Entscheidung war, weil Eure tolle gemeinsame Zeit einfach vorbei war. Tja. Das ist ein seltsamer Mix an Gefühlen.</p>
<p>Ah sorry, sagte ich &ldquo;Freundin&rdquo;?  Ich meinte &ldquo;Firma&rdquo;. 😉  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cj81bf7qtuC/">RECUP Workation #3</a> — etwas FOMO, definitiv.</p>

<li>Meine Ehe. ❤️</li>
<li>Wir können selbstbestimmt leben und unseren Wohnort frei und unabhängig wählen.</li>

<li>Ich habe Freunde — sie wohnen ein paar Stunden weit weg, aber ich habe Freunde.</li>
<li>Facetime, was mir erlaubt, meine Leute in der Fremde zu sehen, zwar immer mit etwas Signalverlust, aber 10× besser als nix!</li>
<li>Ich bin eine weiße, männliche, mitteleuropäische Hete und lebe in einer gut funktionierenden Demokratie, die nicht von Krieg, Hunger und Leid geplagt ist. (&ldquo;Game difficulty: Easy Mode&rdquo;)</li>

<li>Ich kenne mittlerweile ein paar sehr nette Flensburger:innen.</li>
<li>Genug Taschengeld, um öfters mal in Cafés und Restaurants einkehren zu können.</li>

			 <p>Zeit verfliegt, wenn man Spaß hat.</p>
<p>Und im Moment habe ich viel Spaß: ich habe mehrere Plugins für eins meiner meistbenutzten Tools veröffentlicht, und arbeite an einer kommerziellen macOS/iOS-App, die auf einem davon aufbaut.  Das wird sicher nicht die Welt verändern, aber hoffentlich weltweit vielen anderen Nutzern dieses Tools das Leben <!-- raw HTML omitted -->vereinfachen.🤞🏼<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Die Tage bestehen also hauptsächlich aus Zeit am Schreibtisch, aus Grübelnd-aus-dem-Fenster-starren, aus stundenlangem Rumhacken auf der Tastatur und gelegentlichen zufriedenem Grunzen, wenn etwas nach Plan läuft.  Ich bin voll im Flow, es fühlt sich richtig gut an, und ist genau die perfekte Menge an Action gerade.  Es muss nicht immer der große Wurf sein, auch wenn die kleine Stimme im Hinterkopf ab und an Dinge sagt wie <em>&ldquo;Ist das schon alles?&quot;</em> oder <em>&ldquo;Sollten wir nicht die Welt retten?&quot;</em>.  Es ist gut, dass die Stimme da ist, sie kann ein guter Antrieb sein, aber es ist auch gut zu wissen, wann man sie ignorieren kann und sollte.  Shut up, Stimme, nicht jetzt.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Also kümmere ich mich gerade um meine Plugins für Obsidian (das erwähnte Tool) mit ihren Projektplänen, die Planung für meine neue App, und die Marketing-Strategie, die ich fahren möchte.  Letzteres ist neu für mich, ich bin gespannt, welche Resultate sie bringen wird, wenn ich sie umgesetzt habe.  Und das erste Mal seit <a href="/2022/04/29/fresh-in-flensburg.html">meinem Abschied vom alten Job</a> habe ich derzeit auch das Gefühl, gerade einen guten <em>neuen</em> Job kennenzulernen.  Das ist sehr schön.</p>
<p>Nachdem man im neuen Job ja möglichst solide rüberkommen möchte, habe ich mir nach zwei Monaten, in denen ich meinen Haar(wild)wuchs ignorierte<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, Anfang der Woche endlich mal wieder einen erfolgreichen Friseurtermin gegönnt — und fühlte mich sofort danach sehr viel aufgeräumter (und sexy, y&rsquo;all welcome).  Faszinierend, was das &ldquo;gefühlte Aussehen&rdquo; für die eigene Stimmung tut…  Kürzere Haare, mehr Mojo.  Gute Voraussetzungen für neue Projekte.  Let&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->go! 🚀<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Eine gute Woche.</p>
<p>Die meisten wachen Stunden verbringe ich derzeit mit Programmieren und Software-Entwicklung, denn nach vielen Monaten der gefühlten Ziellosigkeit überrollten mich plötzlich ein paar gute Ideen, die ich jetzt umsetze.  Dazu lerne ich mich gleichzeitig in mehrere Programmiersprachen und Frameworks ein, und arbeite an einem mehrstufigen Projekt, das mit etwas Glück am Ende für etwas Einkommen sorgt.  In dieser Woche hatte ich auch meinen ersten <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://45mins.de">45 Minuten</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->-Termin hier in Flensburg, der richtig gut war. Dann gaben wir unsere Stimmen für die OB-Wahl ab, und auf der Freitags-Klimademo<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> waren wir auch noch.</p>
<p>Volle Tage, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->aber: 🚀!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Bei all der energiegeladenen guten Laune sollte man trotzdem nicht vergessen, auch mal Pausen oder einen Ausflug zu machen.</p>
<p>Sønderborg (für deutsche Ohren: &ldquo;Sönderbohr&rdquo;) ist ein dänischer Nachbar an der nördlichen Seite der Förde.  In der Universitätsstadt leben <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ca. 28.000 Menschen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, die Gemeinde blüht seit ein paar Jahren anständig auf, nicht zuletzt auch wegen einiger ansässiger Firmen wie Danfoss, die ordentlich Geld in die Gegend investieren.</p>
<p>Um nach Sønderborg zu gelangen, bietet sich eine Förderundfahrt an. Damit meine ich einen Auto- oder Bustrip von knapp <!-- raw HTML omitted -->45 km<!-- raw HTML omitted --> rund um die Förde, denn es gibt keinen grenzüberschreitenden Fährverkehr an den Stellen, an denen man es eigentlich erwarten würde.  (Die Region überrascht immer wieder!)  Die Strecke ist bei sonnigem Wetter extrem schön, ruft eine serielle Abfolge von <em>&ldquo;Hach!&quot;</em>-Momenten hervor und ist dadurch sehr kurzweilig.  Die Begeisterung wird schnell anstrengend, es empfiehlt sich ein kurzer Halt für Softeis und Snaccos am in der Gegend weltberühmten <strong>Annies Kiosk</strong>.  Der Kiosk ist über die letzten Jahrzehnte zu einer Institution geworden, er darf in keiner TV-Doku über das südliche Dänemark und die Förde-Region fehlen, und kann sogar eine eigene Wikipedia-Seite aufweisen.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> (Huh.)  Ein Bekannter und Segler erzählte mir erfreut, dass der Kiosk über einen eigenen Bootsanleger verfügt, und die Entfernung nach Flensburg so kurz ist, dass man nach Feierabend für einen Hotdog von FL bis zum Kiosk segeln und noch vor Einbruch der Nacht wieder daheim sein kann. <code>#lifeGoals</code></p>
<p>Kurz vor dem Fahrtziel kamen wir in Dybbøl an einer großen Mühle vorbei, die allerdings <strong>so</strong> hart nach <em>&ldquo;dänisches Klischee für den Tourismus&rdquo;</em> aussieht, dass ich nur abwinken und weiterfahren wollte, ohne weiter darüber nachzudenken.  Allerdings steht die Mühle dort tatsächlich seit 1744 und wurde seitdem mehrfach <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(wieder-)aufgebaut.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Vor einigen Jahren spendierte man ihr eine umfassende Renovierung, und jetzt ist sie ein Museum.  Trotzdem: <em>it&rsquo;s a bit much</em>, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Leute 😉<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Aber dann: Sønderborg.  Eine hübsche kleine Stadt!  Mein persönliches Highlight aber war das Alsik Hotel &amp; Spa, in dem man einerseits auf der Terrasse im Erdgeschoss sehr gemütlich Kaffee trinken kann, und das andererseits sein komplettes 17. Stockwerk als öffentliche, kostenlose 360°-Besucherterrasse zur Verfügung stellt.  Als sich die Lifttüren öffneten, hat mir der Ausblick etwas die Sprache verschlagen.  Wir waren am Vormittag eines Wochentags dort, und hatten die Etage somit nahezu für uns allein. Wirklich, wirklich toll.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ehrlich, <em>you can&rsquo;t hate on that view:</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Siehst Du auf dem Foto auch die Erdkrümmung?  Irre!!  (Sorry, nein, das ist nur ein Nebeneffekt des Panoramas.)  Schöne Gegend hier, erwähnte ich das schon?</p>

<p>PS: Für ein paar weitere Eindrücke kann ich die <a href="https://youtu.be/XUaa_38vjHA">WDR-Reisen-Doku &ldquo;Wunderschön: Die Flensburger Förde&rdquo;</a> empfehlen.

			 <p>Unsere Corona-Infektionen sind überstanden: jeweils <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4 Nächte<!-- raw HTML omitted --> mit Fieber und dazwischen Tage, die typisch sind für heftige Erkältungen, und welche uns dann auch nach dem abschliessenden negativen Test noch eine gute Woche erhalten blieben.  Alles in Allem fühlte es sich an wie eine g&rsquo;scheite Grippe, nicht mehr und nicht weniger.  Mein Verstand sagt mir, dass die bisherigen vier COVID-Impfungen eine gute Idee waren.  Danke, Medizin!</p>
<p>Wenn möglich, je nach Tagesverfassung, habe ich auch in der Krankheitszeit meine Runden durch die Hood gedreht.  Isolieren kann ich mich auch an der frischen Luft, mit gesundem Abstand zu anderen Menschen.  Meine Eltern waren in der Stadt, und auch wenn wir uns nicht umarmen oder ihnen unsere Wohnung zeigen konnten — dank Sonnenwetter mit steifem Wind waren wenigstens ein paar Spaziergänge und Gespräche <!-- raw HTML omitted -->drin. 🎉<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Langsam macht sich der Herbst an der Förde breit, und das sonnige Sommerwetter wird immer öfter unterbrochen von kurzen Schauern.  (Mir scheint, das Venn-Diagramm &ldquo;Jahreszeiten an der dänischen Grenze&rdquo; hat nur sehr knappe Überschneidungen, und die Übergangszeiten bemessen sich in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stunden. 😉)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Unser erster Herbst hier oben!

<p>Die Ostsee hat ja weder Ebbe noch Flut, was ich sehr schätze.  (Meere wie die Nordsee werben zwar damit, die &ldquo;echte See&rdquo; zu sein, aber was bekommt man dort wirklich?  Die Hälfte der Zeit gibt es nur die Hälfte vom Meer — und niemand hinterfragt diesen etwas zweifelhaften Arbeitsethos?  C&rsquo;mon.)  Aber: starker Westwind kann das Wasser aus der Förde in die Ostsee schieben, was zu leeren Hafenbecken<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> oder auch zu trockengelegten Stränden führen kann.  Letzteres passiert gerade in der stürmischen Saison des Öfteren.  Als ich das das erste Mal unvorbereitet sah, hat es mich ziemlich verwirrt.</p>
<p>Erste Vermutung: der Zar hat russische Militärkampftrinker nach <!-- raw HTML omitted -->St. Petersburg<!-- raw HTML omitted --> geordert, damit sie die Ostsee strategisch leerschlürfen.  Aber nope: nur das Wetter.  Und auch wenn ich weiß, dass die Solitüde-Strandabschnitte sehr flach sind — ich finde das Zusammenspiel der Naturgewalten beeindruckend: <em>Der Wind drückt über Stunden hinweg gigantische Wassermengen aus der Förde hinaus und sorgt für einen 10-15cm niedrigeren</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>Wasserstand.</em> 🤯<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Aber der Anblick macht mich an manchen Tagen auch etwas traurig, weiß ich doch, dass sich all das rapide verändert. Studien prognostizieren aufgrund der hausgemachten Grönland-Eisschmelze einen Anstieg des Meeresspiegels von <!-- raw HTML omitted -->27 bis 78cm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bis 2100<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, <strong>hinzu</strong> kommt das Abschmelzen des ostantarktischen Eisschildes, welches einen Anstieg von ~5m bis 2300 ausmachen wird.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  Selbst wenn wir heute unseren CO2-Ausstoß einfrieren <em>könnten</em>, die Veränderung auf planetarer Ebene ist schon in vollem Gange.</p>
<p>Und so ziehe ich im Kopf sehr oft schon die Wasserlinie neu, wenn ich am Ufer entlang laufe.  Auch, wenn ich das eigentlich gar nicht möchte; aber es ist, wie es ist, sagt mein gelernter Gleichmut.</p>
<p>Tja, stürmische Gedanken an herbstlichen Tagen.  Was die Klimakrise tatsächlich bewirkt, das habe ich erst wirklich verstanden, als ich nicht mehr in einer Großstadt wohnte.  Ich mag Großstädte, sie haben oft viel zu bieten, aber sie nehmen uns auch den dauerhaften direkten Bezug zur Natur.  Okay, ja, die Sommer werden überall heißer — aber komplett ausgetrocknete Böden und Wälder bleiben ein abstraktes Konzept, wenn um Dich herum weder Gärten noch wilde Baumbestände zu finden sind; steigende Meeresspiegel bleiben Theorie, wenn das Meer nicht zu Deinem täglichen Leben gehört usw.</p>
<p>Puh.</p>
<p>Trotzdem: <a href="/2022/08/14/fresh-in-flensburg.html">nicht verzagen, nicht aufgeben.</a> ✊🏼  Ich bin mir sicher, dass die Förde auch mit mehr Wasser toll sein wird.</p>
<p>Abschliessender medizinischer Tipp, weil ich es auch vor ein paar Tagen erst wieder gemacht habe: geht zur Apotheke und lasst einen Vitamin D-Test durchführen. (Das kostet so um die 30€.)  Vitamin D ist ein Hormon, welches vom Körper primär über die Haut bei Sonneneinstrahlung gebildet wird, und sich ganz entscheidend auf die Stimmung auswirkt.  Gerade in der kälteren und dunkleren Jahreszeit sind bei vielen Menschen die Vitamin D-Level sehr gering, was zu Schwermut bis hin zu Depression führen kann.  In der Apotheke gibt&rsquo;s bei einem solchen Test i.d.R. auch eine Beratung, ob und wie man die körpereigene Vitamin D-Versorgung aufpäppeln kann.  Diese Art von Lebensqualität ist relativ einfach zu <!-- raw HTML omitted -->haben. 👍🏼<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			<h1><a href="https://zottmann.org/2022/08/28/fresh-in-flensburg.html">Fresh in Flensburg #18: Jeans</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Wohnungen sind wie Jeans.</p>
<p>An unserer letzten Adresse in München wohnten wir <!-- raw HTML omitted -->16 Jahre<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Ich kann mich nicht mehr daran erinnern, wie ungewohnt und neu sich alles in der ersten Zeit angefühlt hat, aber ich weiß, dass es so war.  Wir vergrößerten uns von ca. 60 auf 100m², und das Mehr an Platz war toll.  Wir füllten die Räume relativ schnell mit Zeug und mitgebrachten Erinnerungen, mit Wünschen und Ideen, was die Zukunft sicher alles bringen wird; einige der Ideen waren Leihgaben und eigentlich schon lange über ihrem MHD, aber das begriffen wir erst nach und nach.</p>
<p>Das Haus war dabei ein wenig wie ein neues Kleidungsstück, das schon beim Kauf mit Hoffnungen überfrachtet wird.  Mit diesen Schuhen werde ich endlich zu joggen beginnen!  In diesem Kleid kann ich auf legendäre Parties gehen!  Diese Leggings machen mich zum Yoga-Monster!  Dieses Shirt wird großartig in den Nachrichten aussehen, wenn ich den Nobel-Preis für planloses Gärtnern in Empfang nehme!  Diese Jeans rückt meinen Hintern gut ins Spotlight!</p>
<p>Aber wie es so ist mit neuer Kleidung: Erst wenn man sie trägt, lernt man sie richtig kennen und sieht, ob und wie sie <em>wirklich</em> passt, was man in ihr machen kann und machen möchte.  Die Sneaker sind klasse, aber ich gehe lieber damit spazieren als joggen; das Kleid ist schön, aber es bringt nicht automatisch mehr Parties in mein Leben; die Leggings machen meine bessere Hälfte rollig, aber das mit dem Yoga wird irgendwie nichts; das Shirt ist nur meh, und ich finde Gärtnern doof.</p>
<p>Erst wenn man sich <em>wirklich</em> auf ein neues Domizil und dessen Umgebung einlässt, und versteht, wie es bewohnt werden <em>möchte</em>, kann es sich richtig anfühlen.  In unserer alten Wohnung brauchte dieser Prozess tatsächlich ein paar Jahre.  Wir räumten sie ein, um, um, um, aus, ein, um, aus, um — und irgendwann fanden wir zusammen eine gute Balance bei Möbeln, Deko, Licht und Freiraum, die für uns Drei<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> passte.  Das war schön.</p>
<p>Die Jeans formte den Hintern also etwas anders, als wir anfangs dachten — aber sie saß nach einiger Zeit verdammt gut.</p>
<hr>
<p>Wir sind jetzt etwas mehr als drei Monate hier oben.  Ich habe mich eingelebt, auch wenn die ersten Wochen innerhalb und ausserhalb der eigenen vier Wände alles fremd erschien.  An manchen Tagen habe ich immer noch das irritierende Gefühl, dass ich hier nur als Gast bin und demnächst wieder heimfahren muss, aber auch das wird <!-- raw HTML omitted -->vergehen. 😂<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="https://zottmann.org/2022/05/07/fresh-in-flensburg.html">Wir kamen mit wenig</a>, merkten aber recht schnell, dass wir immer noch zu viele Möbel besaßen.  Wir mochten sie nach wie vor, aber manche funktionierten einfach nicht in der neuen Bleibe: Der Platz war zwar vorhanden, aber <em>die Wohnung selbst</em> war nicht der richtige Platz für sie.  Wir fanden ihnen also ein neues Zuhause in der Nachbarschaft, in Dänemark und in Hamburg. <code>#noWaste</code></p>
<p>Dafür kamen neue Stücke in unsere Wohnung, mit denen wir und die Räume sich wohlfühlen.  Das meiste steht da, wo es stehen soll, wo es sich derzeit richtig anfühlt.  Nicht zu leer, nicht zu voll, alles da inklusive Luft zum Atmen.</p>
<p>Anders ausgedrückt: Die neue Jeans sitzt tight und mein Arsch sieht <em>fantastisch</em> darin aus.</p>
<p>Zeit, neue Leute kennenzulernen!</p>
<hr>
<p>Die Flensburger Innenstadt besteht gefühlt zu 20% aus Leerstand, zu dem Corona und Lockdowns sicherlich ihren Teil beigetragen haben.  Der traurige Blick der verwaisten und verschlossenen Geschäfte folgt den Besucher:innen, die durch Große Straße, Holm und Norderstraße schlendern. Das ist ein grundsätzliches Problem wie in vielen anderen Städten auch; wenn sich der Leerstand ausbreitet, wird die Gegend unattraktiver für die Anwohner, die zivile Gesellschaft und Geschäftstreibende.</p>
<p>Wie ich in dieser Woche bei einem spontanen Besuch in der coolen kleinen Urbanica Art Gallery<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> im schnieken Käthe-Lassen-Hof erfahren durfte, investiert Flensburg in eine Abteilung Innenstadtmanagement!  Dieses hat die Aktion <a href="https://www.flensburg.de/deine-ideen/">&ldquo;Deine Innenstadt, Deine Ideen&rdquo;</a> ausgerufen, und in der Urbanica einen entsprechenden Workshop veranstaltet.  Mit 630.000€ im Fördertopf sucht FL nach neuen Ideen, um seinen Kern zu beleben.  Ich kam schnell mit Emin (Urbanica + ein halbes Dutzend andere Ventures) und Bela, Jenny &amp; Sönke (Stadt FL) ins Gespräch über Möglichkeiten, Ideen und gesellschaftliche Fragen (<em>&ldquo;Wem gehört die Stadt, der öffentliche Raum?&quot;</em> etc.).  Gute Themen!</p>
<p>Mein Lamento <em>&ldquo;Mir fehlt Co-Working in der Stadtmitte&rdquo;</em> beantwortete Bela grinsend mit <em>&ldquo;Wir helfen Dir mit den Anträgen, wenn Du selbst einen Space eröffnen willst!!&quot;</em>. Will ich? Uh… nicht im Moment, aber gut zu wissen, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->danke! 😉<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Aussagen wie diese trugen zum Eindruck bei, den ich aus diesen 2h mitgenommen habe: hier sind Menschen, die tatsächlich an Ideen und Brainstorming interessiert sind; die helfen wollen, Projekte auf die Straße zu bringen; und die unsere Stadt dabei nicht zwangsläufig als Initiatorin, aber definitiv als Möglichmacherin <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sehen. 👍🏼<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Und ja: nur Förde, Flens-Brauerei und Fahrzeugbau allein reichen nicht aus, um eine prosperierende, attraktive und lebenswerte Stadt zu erhalten.  Was diese auch anerkennt und aktiv vorantreibt, mit dem <a href="https://www.flensburg.de/Flensburg-2030/">&ldquo;Flensburg 2030&rdquo;-Stadtentwicklungsprozess</a> und dem Bekenntnis zur Neuen Leipzig Charta<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>: sie will <strong>grün</strong> (ökologisch, umweltfreundlich), <strong>gerecht</strong> (sozial) und <strong>nachhaltig-produktiv</strong> (ökonomisch) bleiben und/oder werden.  3 von 3, genau mein Ding!</p>

			 <p><a href="https://extranewsfeed.com/tolerance-is-not-a-moral-precept-1af7007d6376">Yonatan Zunger</a> hat den Begriff der Toleranz definiert (auf Englisch), und es sehr gut auf den Punkt gebracht (meine Übersetzung):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Toleranz ist kein moralisches Absolutum, sie ist ein Friedensabkommen.</strong> Toleranz ist eine gesellschaftliche Norm, weil sie es unterschiedlichen Menschen ermöglicht, Seite an Seite zu leben, ohne sich gegenseitig an die Kehle zu gehen. Das bedeutet, dass wir akzeptieren, dass andere Menschen anders sind als wir, in ihren Sitten, ihrem Verhalten, ihrer Kleidung, ihrem Sexualleben, und dass uns das nichts angeht, wenn es sich nicht direkt auf unser Leben auswirkt. Aber das Modell eines Friedensabkommens unterscheidet sich vom Modell eines moralischen Gebots in einem einfachen Aspekt: Der Schutz eines Friedensabkommens erstreckt sich nur auf diejenigen, die bereit sind, sich an seine Bedingungen zu halten. Es ist eine Vereinbarung, in Frieden zu leben — aber <em>keine</em> Vereinbarung, friedlich zu sein, gleichgültig, wie die Anderen sich verhalten. Ein Friedensabkommen ist kein Selbstmordpakt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wenn also das nächste Mal jemand auf das scheinbare Paradox hinweist, warum wir ihre/seine Intoleranz nicht tolerieren <!-- raw HTML omitted -->können<!-- raw HTML omitted --> wollen: Dies ist die beste, eingängigste, einfachste Erklärung dafür, die ich bislang gefunden habe.</p>

			 <p>Wenn ich es beschreiben möchte, vermeide ich den Begriff &ldquo;wandern&rdquo; bewusst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wandern&rdquo;, das klingt nach großem Rucksack, Anglerhut, nach festem Schuhwerk und Jakobsweg.  Nach Hochschullehrern im Ruhestand und dem vergnüglichen Schnaufen durch die Rhön oder die Sächsische Schweiz.  Nach klaren Tagesetappen und zeitlich geplantem Absacker im auf Google Maps gut bewerteten Restaurant.</p>
<p>Nichts gegen all das (<em>you do you</em>, liebe Hochschullehrer im Ruhestand!), aber das ist nicht, was ich tue.  Zum Einen: Nur wenig bis keine Vorbereitung; nur kleines bis kein Gepäck; nur ein grober bis gar kein Plan.  Zum Anderen: … hmmmm.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Einer meiner Lieblingsautoren, der in Japan lebende US-Amerikaner Craig Mod, schreibt großartige, berührende Essays und Büchern über das &ldquo;Walking&rdquo;.  Seine <em>Walks</em> sind sehr oft sehr lang; genügen mir meist <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5–10 km<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, um mich zu leveln, so ist er oft über Tage hinweg unterwegs, durchmisst über hunderte Kilometer hinweg seine Heimat Japan oder auf Reisen England und Australien.  Sie sind zu gleichen Teilen notwendiger Offline-Ausgleich, ein Ausatmen, ein Sammeln von neuer Kraft, Mediation, Inspiration, Glück, das Nachgehen von Neugier und das Zelebrieren von Menschen, Natur, Städten.  All das, all das zusammen.  And I get it: Beim Lesen seiner Essays spüre ich tief in mir drin ein andächtiges Nicken, die Worte und Gedanken resonieren.  Das.  Genau das ist es.  Good stuff.</p>
<p>Nur: Diese Fülle an Bedeutungen macht es mir schwer, ein passendes deutsches Wort für diesen allumfassenden Begriff &ldquo;Walk&rdquo; zu finden.  Oder… ist <em>das</em> Wandern, und Anglerhut und Pilgerweg sind optional‽</p>
<p>Aber vielleicht ist das genaue Benennen auch nicht notwendig; möglicherweise reicht die Beschreibung aus, so dass Du auch trotz meines Mangels an passenden Worten verstehst, welche Gefühle ich beschreiben möchte. Oder aber Du würdest auch nach hunderten weiteren Worten nur freundlich mit den Schultern zucken.  (Beides okay, so oder so danke für&rsquo;s Lesen.😉)</p>
<p>Sei&rsquo;s drum: Ich wandere also.</p>
<p>An manchen Tagen ist <em>kein</em> Walk einfach keine Option, dann drängt es mich raus, Strecke machen.  Vielleicht muss ich meinen Kopf lüften; vielleicht fühlt sich die Welt gerade mal wieder an wie ein viel zu enger Sweater; vielleicht stecken Ideen und Gedanken fest und brauchen das, was die alten Römer mit <em>solvitur ambulando</em> (<em>&ldquo;es wird durch Gehen gelöst&rdquo;</em>) beschrieben haben.  Carlo braucht etwas Carlo-Zeit, let&rsquo;s roll.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Die Runde heute führt mich zum Quellental in Glücksburg.  Erstmal nach Westen, raus aus der Stadt. Hinter mir Mürwik, vorbei an gepflegten Reihenhäusern, durch die kleinen Straßen mit den schmucken Einfamiliendomizilen.  Ich sehe die Strebergärten mit ihren <em>immer</em> viel zu kurzen Rasen, die der Sonne nichts mehr entgegenzusetzen haben, in denen die obligatorischen Mäh- bald durch Staubsaugerroboter ersetzt werden können, wenn dann nur noch Staub zwischen den Hecken und Büschen liegt. 🤷🏻‍♂️  Hinter der letzten Siedlung in Tremmerup empfängt mich der alte freundliche Wald wie eine kühle Dusche, die Hitze fällt von mir ab.  Adäquat holprige Waldwege führen mich unter hohen Baumkronen an kleinen Seen und Moorflächen vorbei, ich erahne Meierwik mit seinem fantastischen Blick über die Förde mehr als dass ich es durch die Büsche sehe.  Durch Zufall entdecke ich den Roikier See;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> die Reflexionen der Sonne zwischen all den Seerosen lässt mich fast erblinden, und ich habe Kindheit-Flashbacks an Zeltplatzurlaube und Faltboot-Ausflüge zu Waldseen.  Kurze Pause für die obligatorische Handvoll Brombeeren, eine Radfahrerin ruft mir lachend &ldquo;Guten Appetit&rdquo; zu.  Thanks, girl!  Ich glaube, bis jetzt habe ich hier im Wald max. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10 Menschen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> auf Fahrrädern oder neben ihren Hunden gesehen; wir tauschen kurze freundliche &ldquo;Moin!&ldquo;s aus, und lassen uns sonst gegenseitig sein.  Chill.</p>
<p>Eine halbe Stunde später erreiche ich das <a href="https://www.quellental-gluecksburg.de/">&ldquo;Quellental&rdquo;</a>, ein schönes kleines Café/Restaurant am gleichnamigen Ausflugsgebiet direkt neben einem poshen Yachthafen.  Hier kann man gut essen! Neue Erfahrung: nur die Kuchen sind ausg&rsquo;schamt teuer und (schlimmer) der Kaffee ist dünnes Mittelmaß, trotz Siebträgermaschine. Ich hatte große Hoffnungen, Quellental.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> 😢</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Der Rückweg führt mich oben am waldigen Steilufer entlang, die Förde nur einen Steinwurf und/ oder schreienden Sturz entfernt.  Das Quellental ist ein großer Wald, der auch <a href="https://www.gluecksburg-ruheforst.de/">einen Ruheforst</a> beherbergt.  Es ist schön und wundervoll ruhig hier, wirkt aber in den <!-- raw HTML omitted -->25 m<!-- raw HTML omitted --> vor dem Abhang teilweise seltsam aufgeräumt.  Die Lösung für dieses Rätsel: Menschen, die abends unten am Strand Lagerfeuer machen und dafür altes Holz benötigen, Feuerwarnstufe egal, schliesslich ist man direkt am Wasser.  Nun ja.</p>
<p>Ich halte mich in Ufernähe, und komme nach einer knappen halben Stunde nach Meierwik, einem Ortsteil von Glücksburg, der nahtlos an Flensburg anschliesst (und somit definitiv näher an FL als an Glücksburg liegt).  Dann kommt Solitüde, wo ich mich jedesmal auf&rsquo;s Neue frage, wie ich wohl an so ein be-nei-dens-wert gelegenes Grundstück komme, und damit bin ich fast schon wieder daheim.</p>
<p>Knapp <!-- raw HTML omitted -->13 km<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; ich bin ausgepowert und zufrieden.  Die Probleme der Welt konnte ich nicht lösen, aber zumindest weiß ich wieder, dass ich das auch nicht muss.</p>
<p>Ganz egal, wie ich es nenne: Walk, Wanderung, whatever.  Es tut mir gut.</p>

			 <p><strong>Trigger-Warnung: Klimaveränderung.</strong></p>
<p>Es ist definitiv zu heiß für ungetrübt gute Laune.</p>
<p>August 2021: <em>&ldquo;Flensburg ist toll, und die Wetterlage hier oben ist super! Ich glaube, hier wird es auch nicht so wahnsinnig heiß, wegen Ost- und Nordsee nebenan, es wird weniger extreme Ausschläge geben, was glaubst Du?&quot;</em> — <em>&ldquo;Sehe ich genau so, let&rsquo;s do this!&quot;</em></p>
<p>August 2022: <em>&ldquo;Holy shit, es ist bitte WIE HEIß in München‽ Ist Dir klar, dass wir auf eine gewisse Art Klimaflüchtlinge sind‽ 😳&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Wenn ich dieser Tage auf die Wetterkarte von Deutschland schaue, sehe ich tiefrote Zahlen.  Wälder brennen und vertrocknen; der Harz (wo ich geboren bin und wo meine Blutfamilie wohnt) ist in großen Teilen nahezu kahl, dahingerafft von jahrzehntelanger Monokultur, von Trockenheit und von Borkenkäfern in einer fatalen Abfolge.  Große Flüsse und Seen trocknen rapide aus, und Süddeutschland erreicht teilweise subtropische Temperaturen.  Die Wetterextreme rund ums Jahr werden härter, das haben wir selbst die letzten zehn Jahre schon in München beobachtet.  Trinkwasser wird auch hierzulande öfters knapp.</p>
<p>Wir als Menschheit sind in der Phase angelangt, in der das Fortschreiten der exponentiellen Klimaveränderungen spürbar wird, und ich will nicht lügen: Es macht mir Angst.  Nur Idioten haben keine Angst davor.  Ohne Übertreibung: ich bange um die Meinen südlich von mir, und hoffe, dass sie die wachsenden Extreme weiter gut überstehen werden.  Das wird nichts, was man aussitzen kann, dies ist nun unser ständiger Begleiter.  Dana und ich nehmen die Veränderungen schon seit Jahren wahr, wie viele andere aufmerksame Menschen auch, nur werden sie zunehmend drastischer.</p>
<p>Aber unsere Einschätzung hat sich bisher bewahrheitet; auch hier wird es warm und teils auch heiß, ja, aber die nördlichen Meere fangen Einiges ab, gleichen die harten Ausschläge noch aus.  Und auch wenn ich die Sonne und den Sommer echt mag und geniesse: Die Stimme im Hinterkopf gibt keine Ruh'.  Ich weiß, dass sie Teil eines Chores ist, dass nicht nur ich diese Stimme im Kopf höre, nur verbessert das halt die Situation nicht.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Trotzdem bleibt mein Optimismus, auch wenn er es schwerer hat als noch vor 5–10 Jahren.  Vor vielen Jahren habe ich ein Interview mit dem Autor <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson">Kim Stanley Robinson</a> gelesen<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, in dem er ungefähr Folgendes gesagt hat: <em>&ldquo;As a species, we must be optimistic, because we can&rsquo;t <strong>afford</strong> to be pessimistic&rdquo;</em>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  Das kann ich nicht vergessen, es ist für mich so ein Leuchtturm-Satz geworden — etwas, das mich leitet.</p>
<p>Optimismus für mich ist das Benennen der Realität, egal wie gut oder schlecht, verbunden mit der Hoffnung auf Verbesserung, und dem Anerkennen, dass diese sicher nicht ohne aktives Bemühen erreicht wird — aber dass sie erreicht werden <em>kann</em>.  (Pessimismus dagegen ist Stagnation, das <em>&ldquo;Es wird eh nichts mehr, also warum sich bemühen?&quot;</em> — fatal.)</p>
<p>Ja, die Realität könnte echt besser sein.  Klimakrise, Waldsterben, Pandemien.  Aber eben auch: weltweit <strong>endlich</strong> mehr Energie (ahem) beim Ausbau der Erneuerbaren, Geld für die Erforschung neuer nachhaltigerer Energiequellen, eine Renaissance in Medizin und Biotechnologie.  <strong>Wir werden überleben,</strong> auch wenn niemand sagen kann, wie die Welt dann in 50–100 Jahren aussehen wird, und wie hart die Zeit bis dahin wird.</p>
<p>Ich werde meinen Teil dazu beitragen, klein oder groß, aber dazu muss ich (biologisch) funktionieren, und das kann ich besser bei kühleren Temperaturen.  Und vielleicht bedeutet das in ein paar Jahren einen weiteren Umzug — mal sehen.</p>
<p>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaanyways.</p>
<p>Ich komme vermutlich demnächst an den Punkt, an dem ich <a href="/2022/08/07/fresh-in-flensburg.html">genug Brombeeren</a> hatte.  Never thought I&rsquo;d see the day.</p>
<p>Oh, und lest mehr Kim Stanley Robinson!  Er schreibt optimistische Science Fiction (Optimismus wie von mir beschrieben).  Oft spielen die Handlungen in der nahen Zukunft, er extrapoliert dafür sehr gekonnt Entwicklungen und Probleme im Heute, zeigt Auswirkungen und auch immer mögliche Lösungen auf, gepaart mit viel Hoffnung und Ideen. Much, much love.</p>

		<a href="https://zottmann.org/2022/08/07/fresh-in-flensburg.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-08-07 16:41:13 &#43;0200">Aug 7, 2022</time></a>

			 <p>Vor einigen Wochen erwähnte mein Meditationslehrer Jeff in einer Session ein Gedankenexperiment des Schriftstellers und Mystikers Jean Klein:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obwohl sich Dein Körper und Dein Geist seit Deiner Kindheit dramatisch verändert haben, hast Du immer das Wort &ldquo;Ich&rdquo; benutzt, um Dich selbst zu benennen.  Was ist dieses &ldquo;Ich&rdquo;, das Dein Leben von der Kindheit bis heute erlebt hat, durch alle Veränderungen hindurch, das selbst stets unverändert geblieben ist?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seitdem vergehen keine zwei Tage, in denen ich nicht mindestens einmal über diese Frage nachdenke.</p>
<p>Was bin ich? <em>Welcher Teil</em> von mir ist &ldquo;ich&rdquo;? Kombiniert mit dem Wissen um die biologische Zellerneuerung<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> gelange ich dann sehr schnell zu irritierend tiefgreifenden philosophischen Überlegungen: bin ich als Person, als Mensch, vielleicht eine Version vom <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiff_des_Theseus">Schiff des Theseus</a>‽ What is happening aaaaaaaaaaah 🤯</p>
<p>Es ist toll, sich Zeit für so etwas nehmen zu können.</p>
<p>Ich mag Jeff Warren,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> weil er grundsätzlich einen sehr pragmatischen Blick auf das Meditieren vermittelt, ohne viel <em>woo woo</em>: auf das Minimum reduziert benötigt eine Meditation nur zwei Dinge von Dir: <em>&ldquo;you just have to sit and exist&rdquo;</em>. Du kannst nichts falsch machen! Das schaffe ich also immer; aber wenn es mal nicht so gut läuft, dann hatte mein Nervensystem wenigstens für ein paar Minuten eine Pause, und das ist nie verkehrt.</p>
<p>Hin und wieder aber streut er (grinsend) auch solche Sessions ein, die allerdings kein Muss sind. <em>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get a bit weird, but feel free to ignore it!&quot;</em>  Nicht alle davon liegen mir, zugegeben, nur diese hat mich kalt erwischt.  Was … ist … mein Ich?</p>
<p>Was ich zumindest mit Bestimmtheit sagen kann: ja, seit meiner Kindheit hat sich sehr viel verändert, in Körper und Geist … nur nicht meine Liebe zu Beerenfrüchten, diese ist keusch und rein und für die Ewigkeit.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Erwähnte ich schon, dass man an sehr vielen Stellen in der Stadt wild wachsende Brombeeren, Himbeeren und Johannisbeeren finden kann? Nein? Man kann an sehr vielen Stellen in der Stadt wild wachsende Brombeeren, Himbeeren und Johannisbeeren finden, es ist glorreich! Und ich spreche hier nicht von vereinzelten Büschen — das Zeug wächst an der Förde wie Unkraut.  Im letzten Monat allein habe ich <strong>händeweise</strong> Selbstgepflücktes gegessen, und ich werde dessen nicht überdrüssig. Ich hatte Flashbacks an die Zeit als Kind, als ich mit vollen Backen im Wald nahe dem Campingplatz inmitten hüfthoher Blaubeersträucher stand.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Zusammen mit den vier Bäckereien im <!-- raw HTML omitted -->500 m<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-Radius um die Wohnung herum ist Flensburg bisher ein veritables Schlaraffenland!  Mit dem Geld, das wir im Supermarkt <em>nicht</em> für Obst ausgeben mussten, haben wir unseren Umzug schon zur Hälfte re-finanziert.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://zottmann.org/2022/07/31/how-to-use.html">How to use cross-island state management in Deno Fresh</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://zottmann.org/2022/07/31/how-to-use.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-07-31 19:09:41 &#43;0200">Jul 31, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>(This is just a quick write-up since the question/ topic came up on the Deno Fresh discussion board (<a href="https://github.com/denoland/fresh/discussions/230">&ldquo;State sharing between islands&rdquo;</a>) to which I wrote a short reply. I felt like elaborating here. The examples are stripped to bare minimum, so there&rsquo;ll be no TS definitions and no import maps.)</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2022/ec82456afa.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the first piece of code from the text"></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve built a new site using the wonderful <a href="https://fresh.deno.dev/">Deno Fresh</a> web framework.  You have a number of unconnected islands all over the place and now want them to interact with eachother without resorting to hacks like passing data around using some key on the <code>window</code> object.  <strong>In my personal experience</strong> the best way to do that is by using some sort of state management — using a <em>reactive</em> store of arbitrary data.</p>
<p>There are a number of options here (Zustand, Redux, mobx etc. come to mind) but my preferred go-to is <a href="https://github.com/hmans/statery">Statery</a> by my guy <a href="https://twitter.com/hmans">@hmans</a>.</p>
<p>Statery bills itself as &ldquo;Surprise-Free State Management&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s 100% true. It does offer a store, the bare minimum of necessities to make that store and its state reactive, and then sends you on your merry way.  Personally, I prefer that approach over the usual <em>&ldquo;does everything (and your mom)&quot;</em> — do one thing, and do it right.  Statery nails that part.</p>
<p>So, how do I set up a store and make two (or more) components share state?</p>
<p>In a nutshell, a Statery store is just a JS module containing a variable which holds your state data.  If you want persistance you&rsquo;ll have to add it yourself. Also, you can have several separate stores doing different things.</p>
<p><em>Side note regarding persistance: For example, in my current app one store contains <a href="https://github.com/hmans/statery#subscribing-to-updates-imperatively">a simple subscriber</a> storing the current state to the visitor&rsquo;s local storage; when the visitor returns at a later date, during its initialization the store checks <code>window.localStorage</code> for existing store data and uses that to hydrate the store.</em></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider <code>./stores/whatever_store.ts</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-typescript" data-lang="typescript"><span style="color:#66d9ef">import</span> {
  <span style="color:#a6e22e">makeStore</span>,
  <span style="color:#a6e22e">useStore</span>,
} <span style="color:#66d9ef">from</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://esm.sh/statery@0.5.4?alias=react:preact/compat&amp;deps=preact@10.8.2&#34;</span>;

<span style="color:#75715e">/* Make a store */</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">store</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">makeStore</span>({ <span style="color:#a6e22e">counter</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">0</span> });

<span style="color:#75715e">/* Write some code that updates it */</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">export</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">incrementCount</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> () <span style="color:#f92672">=&gt;</span>

    <span style="color:#a6e22e">counter</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">state.counter</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,
  }));

<span style="color:#75715e">/**
</span><span style="color:#75715e"> * A wee bit of abstraction so my components don&#39;t need to
</span><span style="color:#75715e"> * import `useState` from Statery

<span style="color:#66d9ef">export</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">state</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> () <span style="color:#f92672">=&gt;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">useStore</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">store</span>);
</code></pre></div><p><em>Side note: notice the import URL here, <a href="https://zottmann.org/2022/07/19/til-how-to.html">telling ESM to substitute its React dependency with Preact 10.8.2 on the fly</a> — which is what Fresh comes with.</em></p>
<p>The store is created only once the first time the module is loaded/ initialized, all the exports use it when called.  Therefore all components using that particular store module access the same data, not different instances.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s write two components, <code>./island/StoreUsingComponent1.tsx</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-typescript" data-lang="typescript"><span style="color:#75715e">/** @jsx h */</span>

    &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">p</span>&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre></div><p>… and <code>./island/StoreUsingComponent2.tsx</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-typescript" data-lang="typescript"><span style="color:#75715e">/** @jsx h */</span>

}
</code></pre></div><p>Lastly, call them from a route or another island:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-typescript" data-lang="typescript"><span style="color:#75715e">/** @jsx h */</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">import</span> { <span style="color:#a6e22e">h</span> } <span style="color:#66d9ef">from</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;preact&#34;</span>;
<span style="color:#66d9ef">import</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">StoreUsingComponent1</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">from</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;../islands/StoreUsingComponent1.tsx&#34;</span>;

    &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">div</span>&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre></div><p>And that&rsquo;s all there is.  Now when you click the button (located in <code>StoreUsingComponent1.tsx</code>) the text displayed by <code>StoreUsingComponent2.tsx</code> will change.</p>
<p>You could do the same thing w/ Zustand or any other state management library, of course.  I just happen to prefer <a href="https://github.com/hmans/statery">Statery</a>&rsquo;s sane and super-reduced API.</p>

			 <p>Meine Eltern hatten sich schon vor längerer Zeit angekündigt, um die Woche in Flensburg zu verbringen.  Leider legte ein launiger Überraschungsauftritt des gestörten Clowns <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Beppo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> COVID die Pläne unzeremoniell auf Eis.  Aber glücklicherweise sind sie anständig durchgeimpft, und ihre Infektion ging vorbei wie eine solide Erkältung, während sie sich daheim auskurier(t)en. Puh.</p>
<p>Stattdessen konnten wir liebe Freunde aus der alten Heimat als erste Gäste in der neuen Homebase zum Frühstück empfangen. Sie waren mit dem <a href="https://carleato.bandcamp.com/track/ich-bin-ein-bully">Bulli</a> auf dem Weg in den noch höheren Norden, und ihr Weg führte sie an Flensburg vorbei.  Die Message <em>&ldquo;Was macht Ihr am Dienstag zum Frühstück?&quot;</em> kam etwas unerwartet, aber hey, im Kalender hatte sich ja spontan eine Lücke aufgetan.  Die Frage konnten wir also mit <em>&ldquo;Euch füttern&rdquo;</em>, einem Berg <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Semmeln<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Brötchen und einem Kilo Erdbeeren beantworten.  Danach zeigten wir F&amp;L noch die sonnige Hood und den Strand — kam gut an. Nicht, dass ich nach Bestätigung süchtele, aber F&rsquo;s mehrfaches <em>&ldquo;Das habt Ihr gut gemacht&rdquo;</em> war trotzdem schön zu hören.  Yep, es ist schon sehr nice hier. 🙌🏼</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Und als mir klar wurde, wie sehr ich sie (und Andere) vermisst habe, zogen sie dann auch schon weiter, da sie noch ein paar Kilometer vor sich hatten und nicht bis in die Nacht hinein auf der Straße sein wollten.  Bon voyage!</p>
<p>Der Rest der Woche war hauptsächlich von Lernen &amp; Programmieren ausgefüllt.  Faszinierend, wie viel man innerhalb einiger Jahre verlernen kann, wenn man das Wissen nicht benötigt.  <em>&ldquo;Use it or lose it&rdquo;, indeed.</em>  Mein Hirn ist sehr gut darin, unbenutzte Fähigkeiten relativ schnell einfach vom Tisch zu schieben — ähnlich einer Hauskatze, die Kram vom Regal schmeisst und optional dabei auch noch Blickkontakt hält. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Aber ich komme langsam wieder in meinen Groove und finde mich in meinen neuen Tools zurecht, was mich freut.  Software-Entwicklung ist eines der aggressivsten Gewerke, was Churn bei den Arbeitsmitteln und -prozessen angeht, und gerade im Javascript/TypeScript-Bereich hat sich in den letzten 6-7 Jahren, seit ich die Sprachen produktiv benutzt habe, sehr viel getan.</p>
<p>Software-Entwickler fahren i.d.R. sehr auf neue, interessante, shiny Dinge ab.  Wir lieben dieses High, wenn wir eine neue Sprache/ Bibliothek/ Methodik entdecken, verstehen und erfolgreich einsetzen können.  Nur folgt auf dieses High dann oft der Alltag … ohne Highs.  Also suchen wir nach dem nächsten heissen Ding.  Gerade in der JS-Ecke ist dieses Problem recht verbreitet, was teilweise absurde Auswirkungen auf die Arbeitsmittel (das Tooling) nach sich zieht.  Auf der anderen Seite gibt es ein paar wirklich fantastische Entwicklungen im Web und im JS-Ökosystem, die aus dieser grundsätzlichen Neugier und Begeisterungsfähigkeit geboren wurden.  Nun ja: &ldquo;🍅, 🍅&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ergo: wenn man eine Weile nicht in diesem Bereich gearbeitet hat (sagen wir: 6-7 Jahre), ist der Wiedereinstieg möglicherweise etwas … überwältigend.  Aber ich wurschtele mich durch, und verfolge weiter die Idee der Anleitung zum Stromsparen, <a href="https://zottmann.org/2022/07/10/fresh-in-flensburg.html">die ich vor einigen Wochen hatte</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ich habe dafür eine kleine Site gebaut: <a href="https://stromsparen.foerde.win/">Stromkosten Sparen</a>.</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Dort kann man den aktuellen, eigenen kWh-Preis angeben, und die Geräte im Haushalt auflisten.  Die Site errechnet die jährlichen Kosten.  Das funktioniert schon sehr gut, <a href="https://stromsparen.foerde.win/">check it out</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://stromsparen.foerde.win/"><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2022/a59f72464f.png" alt="Screenshot &ldquo;Stromkosten Sparen&rdquo;"></a></p>
<p>Dazu werden in den nächsten Tagen noch weitere Sektionen kommen, u.A. Auswertungen und Tipps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was bedeutet die aktuelle Energie-Preis-Entwicklung für mich und meine Geräte über die nächsten Jahre?</li>
<li>Wie kann ich mit einfachen Mitteln meine Kosten senken, oder bin ich evtl. sogar schon gut aufgestellt?</li>
</ul>
<p>Die Site ist aktuell sehr simpel, und das ist so gewollt.  Komfort wird nachgeliefert!  😂  Ich habe diverse Ideen auf meiner Todo-Liste, aber irgendwo muss man ja anfangen.</p>
<p><strong>Falls jemand von Euch Ideen fürs Marketing hat, oder wie ich die Site besser verbreiten kann, pingt mich bitte an!</strong>  Ich kann Software entwickeln, aber Branding, Marketing und PR sind schwarze Magie für mich.  Ich habe nicht vor, mit der Site Gewinne zu erzielen, ich möchte nur meine Landsleute zum Energiesparen anhalten.  Jede:r freut sich über mehr Geld in der Tasche am Ende vom Jahr, und das ist (leider) der beste Ansatzpunkt, um Menschen dafür zu gewinnen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep you posted!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://zottmann.org/2022/07/19/til-how-to.html">TIL how to alias dependencies in ES modules fetched from the ESM CDN</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://zottmann.org/2022/07/19/til-how-to.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-07-19 20:42:00 &#43;0200">Jul 19, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m slowly getting into <a href="https://preactjs.com">Preact</a>, <a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a> + <a href="https://fresh.deno.dev/">Deno Fresh</a> and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a>.  So far, Deno Fresh has been enjoyable.  Naturally, just like Deno it allows for <code>import</code>ing ES modules via HTTPS.  At some point today I wanted to use an NPM package, one which uses React internally, and I had to figure out how to tell that dependency to not use React but Preact instead.</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2022/dc026c7c24.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the third code block from the post"></p>
<p><strong>So, to recap:</strong> load an React-related ES module from a CDN but have it use Preact as dependency instead.</p>
<p>Preact comes with its own compatibility layer, <a href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/switching-to-preact/"><code>preact/compat</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] our compatibility layer that allows you to leverage the many libraries of the React ecosystem and use them with Preact. This is the recommended way to try out Preact if you have an existing React app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then there is <a href="https://esm.sh">ESM.sh</a>, a global CDN for NPM packages with ES Module format.  Luckily, ESM has a super-handy <a href="https://esm.sh/#aliasing-dependencies">feature for aliasing dependencies</a> which allows me to tell ESM to get a NPM package but change its internal requirement from <code>react</code> to <code>preact/compat</code>! <a href="/uploads/2022/92395d289a.gif">Noice.</a></p>
<p>I wanted to import <a href="https://github.com/hmans/statery">Statery</a> (&ldquo;surprise-free state management!&quot;) which internally uses React (excerpt from its <a href="https://github.com/hmans/statery/blob/master/src/index.ts#L1"><code>index.ts</code></a>):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from &quot;react&quot;
</code></pre><p>So, in a Node- &amp; React-based app I&rsquo;d call it like this (after adding the NPM package to my <code>package.json</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>import { makeStore, useStore } from &quot;statery&quot;;
</code></pre><p>In my Deno Fresh- &amp; Preact-based app I instead use ESM&rsquo;s URL with aliasing parameters:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>import {
  makeStore,
  useStore
} from &quot;https://esm.sh/statery@0.5.4?alias=react:preact/compat&amp;deps=preact@10.8.2&quot;;
</code></pre><p>Side note: if I omit the <code>deps=</code> argument ESM assumes I want the latest version of Preact (10.10.x), which clashes with 10.8.2 used in Fresh (at the time of this writing).</p>
<p>When I fetch the standard ESM URL for Statery (<code>https://esm.sh/statery@0.5.4</code>) as well as the one containing the alias argument (<code>https://esm.sh/statery@0.5.4?alias=react:preact/compat&amp;deps=preact@10.8.2</code>), and then follow the single <code>import</code> URL in each of them to get to its module, I can see the following difference:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>// before
import{useState as a,useRef as b,useEffect as i}from&quot;/v87/react@18.2.0/es2022/react.js&quot;

// after
import{useState as a,useRef as b,useEffect as i}from&quot;/v87/preact@10.8.2/es2022/compat.js&quot;
</code></pre><p>That is neat.</p>
<p>So: aliasing works absolutely fine, and it&rsquo;s a good-enough practice until I&rsquo;m told otherwise by people more knowledgeable than myself.  :)</p>
<p>Thanks to the absolute champs over at <a href="https://github.com/denoland/fresh/discussions/432">denoland/fresh/discussions/</a> for the pointer.</p>

			 <p>Während wir 2017-2020 das noch junge RECUP aufbauten, mit all den Experimenten für ein besseres Miteinander im Arbeitsalltag, mit den ersten offenen Gehaltsrunden im gesamten Team <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, mit dem Anspruch von maximalmöglicher interner Transparenz, mit der fehlenden oberen Begrenzung des jährlichen Urlaubsanspruches (a.k.a. <em>&ldquo;nimm Urlaub, so viel Du möchtest&rdquo;</em>) etc. — damals sagte ich mehr als einmal im Scherz zu meinen Leuten <em>&ldquo;Alle, die hier anfangen, werden für ihr weiteres Berufsleben komplett versaut&rdquo;</em>, weil ich aus Erfahrung wusste, dass wir sehr viele Dinge (bewusst) anders machten als die meisten anderen deutschen Startups und Unternehmen.</p>
<p>Und… ich hatte Recht damit.  <strong>Ich fühle mich versaut für die Jobs und Gigs, die da noch kommen werden.</strong>  Es waren fünf Jahre mit sehr viel Arbeit — mit sehr <em>sehr</em> viel Arbeit —, in denen ich echt viel gelernt und mega viel Freude erfahren habe als Teil einer großen Herde von Qualitätsmenschen.  Die Kehrseite: die volle Identifikation mit der eigenen Firma und die feste Überzeugung, etwas wirklich Wichtiges zu tun, ließ mich auch vergessen, öfters mal abzuschalten und nach der Startup-Phase eine gesunde Balance zwischen Arbeit und dem eigenen Ich wiederherzustellen.  Mein Burnout hatte Gründe, you know?</p>
<p>ABER.</p>
<p>Vor RECUP war die Antwort auf die Frage nach meinem &ldquo;Plan&rdquo; oder meiner &ldquo;Vision&rdquo; immer ein emphatisches <em>&ldquo;Uuuuuuhhhh…&quot;</em>. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  Ich hatte keinen Plan, wo ich in X Jahren unbedingt sein möchte, und daran wird sich auch nichts ändern, because that&rsquo;s how I roll.  Das Leben ist ein Fluss, ich lass mich treiben und schaue, dass ich mir an den Steinen im Wasser nicht die Nase aufschlage, und sehe trotzdem viel von der Welt.</p>
<p>Aber meine &ldquo;Vision&rdquo; kann ich seit ein paar Jahren überraschend gut umschreiben:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ich möchte an etwas Sinnvollem arbeiten, zusammen mit Menschen, die mir wichtig sind und die mich inspirieren.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Das klingt klein, wenig &ldquo;visionär&rdquo; und erfrischend vage, und das ist beabsichtigt.  Die Definition von &ldquo;etwas Sinnvolles&rdquo; kann sich immer wieder mal ändern, in Größe und Thema, ich erwarte nur von mir selbst, ehrlich zu mir zu sein.  <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Ein paar Beispiele: Ist Müllvermeidung sinnvoll?  (Absolut.)  Die Vermittlung von Wissen?  (Ja.)  Das Bauen von Dating-Plattformen?  (Nein.)  Das Produzieren von Kram, um Kram verkaufen zu können, damit Menschen etwas zum &ldquo;shoppen&rdquo; haben?  (Nein.)  Das Abfedern unseres Klimafuckups?  (JA.)  Business-Improv-Theater bei Xing oder LinkedIn?  (GTFO.)  Das Streiten über Web-Frameworks und Programmiersprachen?  (Nicht mehr.)  Der ganze Hustle des Hustles wegen?  (Nope.)</p>
<p>Wie auch immer <strong>ich für mich</strong> &ldquo;sinnvoll&rdquo; definiere, das ist relevant.  Wenn ich dann <strong>für mich</strong> ein Betätigungsfeld als sinnhaft identifiziert habe, welches ich auch bestellen möchte <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, dann sind meine Zeit und Energie dort gut investiert, und dann kann ich auch Rückschläge bei der Arbeit besser verkraften.</p>
<p>Früher™ war ich meist als Einzelkämpfer unterwegs mit meinen Ideen und Projekten.  Aber alles allein umsetzen zu wollen und/oder alles selbst bestimmen und beeinflussen zu wollen, das kann Dich ausbrennen.  Nehmen wir RECUP als Beispiel: ich wollte 2017 etwas gegen die Einwegbecherflut tun, aber anstatt mich damals mit Flo, Fabi und Johanna zusammenzutun, hätte ich auch versuchen können, in Konkurrenz ein eigenes Mehrweg-Pfandsystem auf die Beine zu stellen (&ldquo;CarloCup&rdquo;).  Vielleicht wäre es mir auch gelungen, wer weiss?  Ich gäbe dann vielleicht Interviews, wäre in mehr Podcasts zu Gast, die Landesregierung in München hätte mich zum Verdienten Geschäftsmenschen des Bayrischen Volkes gekrönt, und ich könnte mir steigende Chancen auf eine zukünftige Kanzlerschaft ausmalen oder so.  Aber was hätte das gebracht — nicht nur mir, sondern uns als Gesellschaft?</p>
<p>CarloCup und RECUP hätten vermutlich irre viel Energie mit dem Konkurrieren verbrannt.  Aber es war sinnvoller, stattdessen diese Energie in den gemeinsamen Kampf gegen Einwegmüll zu stecken, und es als ein Team zu tun, hat unsere Erfolgschancen erhöht.  Ich habe Wissen und Fähigkeiten an den Tisch gebracht, die sonst niemand hatte, und habe umgekehrt vom Wissen und den Fähigkeiten der Anderen profitiert.  Statt mich allein auf alles konzentrieren zu müssen, konnte ich viel lernen und wurde inspiriert.  <strong>Gemeinsam ging und geht mehr, und eigentlich ist das sehr oft der beste Weg vorwärts.</strong>  Ich war so zwar weder in Interviews noch in Podcasts, Markus Söder hat keine Ahnung, wer ich bin, und Kanzler werde ich wahrscheinlich auch nicht mehr — dafür fühlte ich mich in der Zweiten Reihe ziemlich wohl und konnte viel bewegen.  Und RECUP ist mittlerweile das weltweit erfolgreichste Mehrweg-Pfandsystem für To-Go-Geschirr. Guter Deal, alles in allem.</p>
<p>Und heute?  Ich glaube, über die letzten paar Wochen bin ich auf ein, zwei sinnvolle Projekte für mich gestoßen.  Ich weiss zwar noch nicht, ob und wie ich damit irgendwann einmal Geld verdienen kann, und in der jetzigen Phase bin ich auch noch solo, aber hey — es heißt &ldquo;Vision&rdquo; und nicht &ldquo;Beschreibung des Ist-Zustandes&rdquo;, und irgendwo muss man ja anfangen.</p>
<p>Also nein: ich bin nicht versaut für&rsquo;s weitere Berufsleben.  Ich habe nur sinnvollere Ansprüche an mich und meine Umgebung.  😉</p>

			 <p>Eigentlich wollte ich gestern nur ein paar Sätze zu meinen Energie-Einsparung-Erkenntnissen der letzten Woche schreiben.</p>
<p>Es folgten: viele handschriftliche und digitale Notizen, ein Google Sheet für Stromkostenberechnungen, und mehrere Stunden Arbeit.  Abends saß ich dann vor <!-- raw HTML omitted -->~1400 Wörtern<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, die den Newsletter sowohl thematisch als auch vom Umfang her komplett gesprengt hätten. 🧐  Also habe ich stattdessen einen <a href="https://zottmann.org/2022/07/09/energieverbrauch.html">Blogpost mit dem Titel &ldquo;Reden wir über unseren Energieverbrauch&rdquo;</a> daraus gemacht.  Leset und teilt, würde mich freuen!  (Alternativer Clickbait-Titel: &ldquo;<em>Du glaubst nicht, wie einfach Du VIEL GELD zuhause sparen kannst</em> 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Das hat zwar Spaß gemacht und war produktiv, nur stand ich heute morgen dann immer noch ohne neue FiF-Ausgabe da.  Egal, nimm die Tage, wie sie kommen!  Und so waren wir heute dann erstmal wieder bei exzellentem Wetter am Hafen, wo das sog. <a href="https://www.dampfrundum.de/">Dampfrundum 2022</a> stattfand.  Es gab Dampfboote, Dampfschiffe, Dampfeisbrecher (!) und Dampftraktoren (!!) von ganz ganz früher zu begaffen, und (viel wichtiger) g&rsquo;schmackiges Ale von <a href="http://www.hansensbrauerei.de/">Hansens</a>, &ldquo;Deutschland&rsquo;s nördlichster Gasthausbrauerei&rdquo;. Später folgten noch absolut fantastische frische Apfeltaschen und Quarkbällchen von einem der Süßkramstände.</p>

<p>Seit wir im vor drei Monaten im April 2022 die Stadtwerke Flensburg als unseren Stromversorger ausgewählt haben, sind die Preise für die Kilowatt-Stunde um ~17% gestiegen.  Unser aktueller Preis ist für 12 Monate fixiert auf 50,07 ct/kWh, aber … you know.  Die neue Klimarealität, die wirklich gute Agenda <a href="https://flensburg-mitmachen.de/flensburg-2030">Flensburg 2030</a>, das faschistische Großmachtsstreben des russischen Zaren, plus diverse andere Faktoren — all das spricht dafür, den eigenen Energieverbrauch zu überdenken.</p>
<h2 id="die-großen-brocken-sind-schon-weg">Die großen Brocken sind schon weg</h2>
<p>Ja, mit den großen Baustellen auf diesem Feld haben wir uns schon befasst:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wir haben uns vom Wohnraum her verkleinert, nicht zuletzt auch, weil ein Haus in der Größe unseres alten für 2-3 Personen komplett überdimensioniert war.  Die Umgewöhnung auf eine Wohnung war nicht allzu schwer, <a href="https://zottmann.org/2022/06/25/fresh-in-flensburg.html">in Gesamtheit betrachtet</a>. 😉</li>
<li>Wir fahren primär ÖPNV und nur noch sehr selten mit dem Auto. Flensburg ist übersichtlich und hilft dabei; die Öffis sind gut ausgebaut, und die Stadt ist sehr Fußgänger- und Bike-freundlich.</li>
<li>Wir haben aus Überzeugung seit Jahren keine Flugreisen mehr gemacht, auch wenn wir Stockholm und Skandinavien schon hart vermisst haben.  Nur: wenn mir die Umwelt wichtig ist (und ich darum z.B. bei einem auf Umweltschutz begründeten Unternehmen (<a href="https://recup.de/">☕️</a>) arbeite), dann kann ich schlecht für die Urlaubsreise in ein Flugzeug steigen (und innerhalb von ein paar Stunden meine gesamte gute Arbeit des letzten Jahres negieren). Ich weiss um CO₂-Kompensation für Flüge, und dass sie besser als <em>keine</em> CO₂-Kompensation ist, aber ich habe auch genug darüber gelesen, um zu verstehen, dass das Konzept zu 75% Greenwashing-Augenwischerei ist. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  (Das ist kein Diss an Menschen, die im Urlaub in die Ferne wollen — aber bitte seid realistisch, wie gut oder schlecht dieses System <em>wirklich</em> funktioniert, denn es ist faktisch kein Ausgleich.)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="es-bleibt-der-tägliche-verbrauch-in-den-eigenen-vier-wänden">Es bleibt der tägliche Verbrauch in den eigenen vier Wänden</h2>
<p>Zwei Fragen, die wir uns anschliessend also gestellt haben:</p>
<ol>
<li>Was brauchen &amp; möchten wir an elektrischen Geräten?</li>
<li>Was verbrauchen diese Geräte, und vor allen Dingen: wann?</li>
</ol>
<p>Die erste Frage haben wir größtenteils schon im Rahmen des Umzuges und dem damit verbundenen Reduzieren von <em>Dingen</em> beantworten können (siehe <a href="https://zottmann.org/2022/05/07/fresh-in-flensburg.html">Fresh in Flensburg #4: 12 Kisten</a>).  Die Liste unserer Geräte ist ziemlich geschrumpft, also habe ich mich mit Frage #2 befasst.</p>
<p>Eins meiner Lieblingstools ist der Energiekosten-Monitor, der zwischen Steckdose und Gerät platziert wird und den Verbrauch des eingesteckten Gerätes misst. (Ich nutze hier einen einfachen REV Energiekosten-Monitor — die gibt&rsquo;s in jedem Baumarkt, z.B. für <a href="https://www.bauhaus.info/messgeraete/rev-energiekosten-messgeraet/p/22768904">12€ bei Bauhaus</a>).  Er zeigt sowohl den aktuellen als auch den gesamten Verbrauch über den Messzeitraum auf, somit kann ich einfach erkennen, wieviel Energie z.B. der TV im Standby und/oder im Betrieb benötigt. Lehrreich.</p>
<p>Über die letzten paar Tage habe ich also alle dauerhaft stromversorgten Geräte auf den Prüfstand gestellt.  Spoiler: das bisschen Standby hier und da ist in Summe nicht zu unterschätzen.</p>
<h2 id="watt-kostet-die-welt">Watt kostet die Welt</h2>
<p>Ein Gerät, welches rund um die Uhr <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1 Watt (W)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> verbraucht, verbrennt im Jahr <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8,76 Kilowattstunden<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (kWh). Bei einem aktuellen/ angenommenen kWh-Preis von <!-- raw HTML omitted -->~0,57 €<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bedeutet das <!-- raw HTML omitted -->~5,00 €/Jahr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Gute Faustformel für den Juli 2022: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1 W/h = 5 €/Jahr.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Sorry für die doofe Zwischenüberschrift.</p>
<h2 id="konkrete-beispiele-und-rechnungen">Konkrete Beispiele und Rechnungen</h2>
<p>Auf meinem Schreibtisch stehen derzeit u.A. ein Laptop-Dock, ein 34&quot;-Monitor und ein Paar Lautsprecher (die ich wirklich selten benutze). Wenn der Laptop nicht angeschlossen ist, verbrauchen die Geräte im Standby-Modus zusammen ca. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6 W<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Die Standby-Zeit beträgt pro Tag durchschnittlich <!-- raw HTML omitted -->18 Stunden<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<ul>
<li>6W = 30 €/Jahr = 52,56 kWh</li>
<li>18 h sind 75% des Tages</li>
<li>75% von 30 € = 22,50 € = 39,42 kWh</li>
</ul>
<p>Ein zweites Beispiel: unsere FritzBox (der Router) läuft 24/7 und mümmelt dabei <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10 W/h<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, weil sie keinen Standby-Modus kennt. Das klingt erstmal nicht viel, aber:</p>
<ul>
<li>10W = 50 €/Jahr = 87,60 kWh</li>
</ul>
<p>Anders gesagt: der Betrieb dieses Gerätes kostet pro Monat <!-- raw HTML omitted -->~4,17 €<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Beispiel #3: der FritzRepeater läuft ebenfalls rund um die Uhr und verbraucht <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3 W/h<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<ul>
<li>3W = 15 €/Jahr = 26,28 kWh</li>
</ul>
<p>Mal abgesehen von den steigenden Kosten: hier verbrauchen Dinge <strong>sinnlos</strong> Energie.  Wenn ich nicht arbeite, müssen mein Dock, Monitor und Lautsprecher nicht in Bereitschaft auf mich warten.  Wenn wir schlafen, benötigen wir weder Router noch WLAN…</p>
<p><strong>Wenn ich es nicht benutze, warum verschwende ich dann Energie dafür</strong>, und warum bezahle ich es?  Aus Gründen des Luxus‽  Fuck that noise.  <strong>Hier sehe ich meinen Beitrag zur Energiekrise.</strong>  (Mehr dazu gleich.)</p>
<p>Das waren lediglich drei konkrete Beispiele aus unserem Haushalt.  In vielen anderen Wohnungen stehen auch Smart Speakers (Alexa/ Google Nest/ Apple), dicke Boxen, 55&quot;-TVs etc.</p>
<h2 id="einfach-mal-abschalten">Einfach mal abschalten</h2>
<p>Hier ist ein kleines, aber wichtiges Detail zu vielen Geräten: wenn es keinen mechanischen Schalter besitzt, um es an- und abzuschalten, wird die Stromzufuhr des Gerätes von einem elektronischen Bauteil gesteuert.</p>
<p>Was funktioniert nicht ohne Strom?  Yep: Elektronik.  Touch-Panels und -Tasten?  Elektronik.  Fernbedienung?  Elektronik.  Das heisst, Geräte mit derlei Aktivierungen verbrauchen nie <em>keinen</em> Strom.</p>
<p>Aus diesem Grund präferiere ich mechanisch-elektrische Lösungen, die den Stromfluss physisch ermöglichen oder unterbrechen:</p>
<ul>
<li>schaltbare Zwischenstecker (<a href="https://www.bauhaus.info/innenstecker-innenkupplungen/unitec-zwischenstecker/p/12149378">Beispiel</a>, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4-5 €<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</li>
<li>Steckdosenleisten mit Schalter (<a href="https://www.bauhaus.info/mehrfachsteckdosen/steckdosenleiste/p/12157803">Beispiel</a>, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3 €<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</li>
<li>einzeln schaltbare Steckdosenleisten (<a href="https://www.brennenstuhl.com/de-DE/produkte/steckdosenleisten/steckdosenleiste-einzeln-schaltbar-6-fach-2m-h05vv-f-3g1-5-weiss">Brennenstuhl</a>, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->27 €<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</li>
<li>analoge Zeitschaltuhren (ich bevorzuge <a href="https://www.theben.de/de/theben-timer-26-0260030">die Modelle von Theben</a>, solide und sehr still, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->15 €<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="konkrete-ergebnisse">Konkrete Ergebnisse</h2>
<ul>
<li>Auf meinem Schreibtisch ist eine einzeln schaltbare Steckdosenleiste installiert.  Nach der Arbeit lege ich den Hauptschalter um, und alles ist abgeschaltet; während der Arbeit kann ich die Lautsprecher sowie andere selten benutzte Geräte wie den Scanner bei Bedarf zu- und abschalten.  <strong>Einsparung: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->39,4 kWh/Jahr<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></li>
<li>Zwischen Fernseher und Steckdosen sitzt ein Zwischenschalter.  In den <!-- raw HTML omitted -->20 h<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pro Tag, an dem wir das Gerät nicht benötigen, zieht es auch keine Energie. <strong>Einsparung: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7,3 kWh<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></li>
<li>Für den Router habe ich auf eine analoge Zeitschaltuhr zurückgegriffen. Zwischen <!-- raw HTML omitted -->01:00 Uhr<!-- raw HTML omitted --> und <!-- raw HTML omitted -->07:00 Uhr<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ist die FritzBox abgeschaltet — <strong>Einsparung: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->21,9 kWh/Jahr<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></li>
<li>Beim Repeater greift das gleiche Konzept wie beim Router — <strong>Einsparung: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6,5 kWh/Jahr<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Summe dieser Beispiele: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->75,1 kWh/Jahr = 42,81 €/Jahr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Nicht irre viel, aber auch nicht wenig!</p>
<p>Die meisten Stromanbieter gehen bei einem 2-Personen-Haushalt von einem Verbrauch von <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2500 kWh<!-- raw HTML omitted --> aus.  Würden wir das tatsächlich verbrauchen, dann bedeuteten diese <!-- raw HTML omitted -->75 kWh<!-- raw HTML omitted --> eine Einsparung von 3%, und sie müssen nicht für uns produziert werden.</p>
<p>Und die Geräte für die Reduktion (Schalter, Steckdosenleiste, Zeitschaltuhren) amortisieren sich spätestens im zweiten Jahr, selbst wenn wir total naiv davon ausgehen, dass die Strompreise nicht weiter steigen werden. Klingt nach einer guten Investition!</p>
<h2 id="mein-beitrag-zur-energiekrise">Mein Beitrag zur Energiekrise</h2>
<p>Mein Beitrag ist das <em>bewusste</em> Verbrauchen von Energie.</p>
<p>Ich kann meinen eigenen Verbrauch beeinflussen — zumindest teilweise.  Unsere Wohnung hat einen elektrisch betriebenen Durchlauferhitzer, ich kann also zwar die Menge an heissem Wasser beeinflussen, aber nicht, dass Wasser <em>auf diese Weise</em> erhitzt wird.  Der Kühlschrank war ebenfalls schon fest verbaut und hat möglicherweise nicht die Energieklasse, die ich mir gewünscht hätte.</p>
<p>Lediglich die Geräte, die mir gehören, die ich betreibe, die kann ich steuern.  Zeitschaltuhren für 24/7-Geräte, mechanische Schalter für Standby-Geräte.</p>
<p>Ja, jede:r von uns muss einen Beitrag leisten, denn <strong>dieser Standby-Energie-Luxus ist verdammtes 20.-Jahrhundert-Denken!</strong>  Basically: Stecker raus wenn nicht gebraucht!  Achte auf Deinen Verbrauch, wir dürfen unseren persönlichen Hedonismus nicht weiter über das Wohl der Gesellschaft stellen!  Alles richtig, meiner Meinung nach.</p>
<p>ABER.</p>
<p>Die richtig großen Brocken sind nicht meine <em>persönliche</em> Aufgabe; wir sind Endverbraucher, wir können und müssen auch nicht alles abfangen, auch wenn uns die freie Wirtschaft diesen Eindruck sehr geschickt vermittelt hat.  Gesellschaft und Industrien müssen sich ändern, und damit meine ich nicht nur die Auto-, Mode-, Nahrungsmittel-, Flugreisen-, Metall- oder Fossilbrennstoffindustrien, sondern auch den &ldquo;Endless Growth&rdquo;-Shit im Technologie Sektor und die <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NIMBY<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-Kacke wie z.B. das <em>&ldquo;Windenergie? Gern, aber nicht hier, wo es total schön ist&rdquo;</em>-Denken in Süddeutschland.  (Das &ldquo;BY&rdquo; in &ldquo;NIMBY&rdquo; steht u.A. auch für &ldquo;Bayern&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>Kurz gesagt: ohne mehr Zusammenhalt lokal und global, ohne mehr Nachhaltigkeit, ohne reales Besteuern von Externalitäten (Umweltverschmutzung, Menschenverschleiss) in der freien Wirtschaft wird es nicht gehen.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make it happen, all of it.  Fangt klein bei Euch daheim an, lasst uns ehrlich mit uns und unserer Umwelt sein, und darauf bestehen, dass für die nächsten Generationen nicht nur ein kleines Stück, sondern wieder ein ganzer Kuchen übrig ist.</p>

<p>Das erste Amazon-Ergebnis für die Suchanfrage &ldquo;Samsung TV&rdquo; ist <em>Samsung Crystal UHD 4K TV 55 Zoll (GU55AU7179UXZG), HDR, Q-Symphony, Boundless screen [2021]</em> für <!-- raw HTML omitted -->479 €<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  <a href="https://www.samsung.com/de/tvs/uhd-4k-tv/au7179-uhd-4k-smart-tv-2021-55-inch-gu55au7179uxzg/">Samsung&rsquo;s Produktseite</a> beziffert den Stromverbrauch im Betrieb mit <!-- raw HTML omitted -->101 W (SDR-Modus)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bis <!-- raw HTML omitted -->130 W (HDR-Modus)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Nehmen wir mal an, dass Samsung bei diesen Angaben nicht lügt 😂, und dass dieser Fernseher <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5 Stunden<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pro Tag im Betrieb ist, dann verbraucht dieses Gerät bei einem 50:50-Mix dieser Bildmodi im Jahr <!-- raw HTML omitted -->209,88 kWh<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bzw. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->119,63 €<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Ich empfinde das als etwas absurd.</p>

			 <p>Wenn Du eine gute Idee hast, aber sie im Moment nicht <em>fühlst</em>, also gerade kein echtes Verlangen aufkommt, sie jetzt umzusetzen, dann kannst Du tief in Dich gehen und Deine Reserven aktivieren, um Dich gezielt auf diese gute Idee zu fokussieren und sie trotz aller aktuellen Unwilligkeit anzugehen — und wenn es Dir gelungen ist, dann weisst Du genau, dass in Dir ein Gewinner schlummert.</p>
<p>Oder aber Du machst stattdessen einen Tagesausflug und fühlst Dich trotzdem wie ein Champ.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Die MS Viking ist ein Ausflugschiff, welches zwischen dem Flensburger Hafen und <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gl%C3%BCcksburg_(Ostsee)">Glücksburg</a> pendelt. Eine volle Rundfahrt dauert knapp 2h und ist zumindest bei gutem Wetter <em>chill <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AF<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em>. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  Nach <!-- raw HTML omitted -->~50 min<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Fahrt an der Südseite der Förde entlang legt die Viking in Flensburg an, ent- und belädt Passagiere, und fährt anschliessend nahe der Nordseite wieder zurück nach Glücksburg.  Das macht sie täglich 4-5⨉.  Der Tag, an dem wir unsere Runde drehten, war perfekt dafür.</p>
<p>Der Anleger im Flensburger Hafen ist nur wenige Minuten von zwei wichtigen Orten des städtischen Lebens entfernt: der sehr tollen <a href="https://planbkaffee.de/">Plan B Kaffeebar</a> in der Norderstraße und Ben&rsquo;s Fischhütte an der Schiffbrücke.</p>
<p>Das <strong>Plan B</strong> ist winzig, gemütlich eingerichtet, im Sommer mit ein paar Sitzplätzen vor der Tür, und hat <em>richtig</em> guten Kaffee.  (Selbstverständlich auch im <a href="https://recup.de/">RECUP</a>.)  Mittlerweile waren wir schon oft genug hier, um wiedererkannt zu werden — das macht den Besuch gleich noch etwas schöner. Direkt gegenüber befinden sich die Dansk Centralbibliotek for Sydslesvig (die Dänische Zentralbibliothek für Südschleswig, wir sind Mitglieder) sowie eine kleine, extrem gute Sauerteig-Bäckerei namens <a href="https://www.instagram.com/waskarlmag/">Was Karl Mag</a>, die auch etwas Feinkost führt.  (Geheimtipp: WKM ist mein #1-Croissant-Dealer in FL.)  Ich find' die Norderstraße gut: zu gleichen Teilen alternativ, gentrifiziert, schick und etwas rattig.  Coole Mischung.</p>
<p>In <strong>Ben&rsquo;s Fischhütte</strong> gibt es &ldquo;Fischbrøtchen&rdquo;, und … wow.  Frische Brötchen, frische Zutaten, guter Fisch, und alles wird erst dann zusammengebaut, wenn es bestellt wird — was die teilweise absurd langen Warteschlangen vor der Bude erklärt.  Hammer.  (Anscheinend hat der Laden keine eigene Website, daher hier nur ein Link zu <a href="https://arnesblogbuch.de/2020/08/10/ausprobiert-bens-fischhuette-in-flensburg/">einem netten Blogpost</a> darüber.)  Wenn man dann glücklich seine extrem gute Semmel futtert, kann man am Hafen entlang spazieren, die großen und kleinen Schiffe begutachten sowie bettelnde Möwen wegscheuchen.  Jeder Ort gewinnt durch einen Hafen und Fischbrötchen!  (München z.B. wäre touristisch attraktiver, wenn man den Marienplatz fluten würde. <code>#fakt</code>)</p>
<p>Und so bekommt man den Tag schon rum, auch wenn die (vermutlich) gute Idee für Erste nur eine Idee bleibt.  Aber nicht jede Idee kann ich sofort in die Tat umsetzen — ich weiss: wenn mein Herz gerade nicht dafür schlägt, wenn mich das Thema nicht anspringt, dann kann ich es mir nachhaltig für lange Zeit verderben, indem ich mich dazu zwinge.  So gut kenne ich mich mittlerweile dann doch schon.</p>
<p>Und im Augenblick fällt es mir leichter, Energie für das Lernen und Ausprobieren von neuem Programmier-Krams aufzubringen.  Oh, und für das Baden in der Förde. 😏</p>

			 <p>Ich erkunde meine Umgebung, wie ein Roomba-Staubsauger es tun würde.</p>
<p>Es ist die gleiche chaotische Methodik: ich laufe in eine Richtung, bis ich auf eine Barriere stoße (ein Wald, eine Sackgasse, eine Autobahn, eine Wand, etc.), drehe mich etwas um die eigene Achse und gehe weiter. D rollt zwar hin und wieder mit den Augen (liebevoll und so), wenn wir auf einem unserer Spaziergänge feststellen, dass wir überraschenderweise im Kreis gelaufen sind, aber <em>*something something*</em> Lernerfahrung.</p>
<p>Vor ein paar Tagen fand ich auf einem solchen mäandernden Streifzug eine etwas abgelegene Stelle zwischen <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCrwik">Mürwik</a> und <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwig">Sandwig</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Das Wetter war nice, ich wollte mich bewegen, auch wenn ich erkältet war und mein Kopf nur auf gut 50% Leistung lief, und ich hatte schon einige Kilometer hinter mir. Ich hatte keine Termine, keinen Zeitdruck und keine Verpflichtungen; ich war nur etwas traurig, dass ich wegen der Erkältung das Barcamp im Technologiezentrum ausfallen lassen musste.  Ich setzte mich also auf die Steine, meine Füße im salzigen Wasser, die Sonne auf meinem beeindruckend vollen Haupthaar, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kollund_%C3%98sterskov">Kollund Østerskov</a> in der Ferne, um mich herum nur Wald und Wasser und Stille, und ich tat … <em>nichts.</em> Ich war einfach nur ich <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in der<!-- raw HTML omitted --> als Teil der Natur. Und es war genug, großartig.</p>
<p>Nach ein paar Minuten tauchte dann plötzlich ein Gedanke auf, geboren aus tiefer Zufriedenheit mit diesem Augenblick: <em>&ldquo;Wenn ich jetzt der letzte Mensch auf der Erde wäre — das wäre auch okay, kein Stress deswegen.&quot;</em>  Genau da, an diesem Platz, in diesem Moment war einfach alles. total. in Balance.  Ich fühlte einen absoluten, erhebenden Gleichmut.</p>
<p>Gut, okay. Mir ist klar, dass das alles total nach <em>woo woo</em> und performativem Zen-Bullshit klingt, und ich würde vermutlich auch abwinken, wenn mir jemand so etwas erzählt. Aber hier ist ein Geheimnis: so einen Platz hatte ich auch in München nie. Fantastische Momente mit den richtigen Leuten zur richtigen Zeit — klar, viele. Und ich 💛 München, immer noch. Aber ein Fleckchen Erde, welches solch intensiven Gefühle auslöst, das gab es nie dort, wo ich wohnte, auch nicht in Minga. Nichtsdestotrotz: schön war es in Bayern.  Nur meine <em>happy places</em>, die lagen bisher immer in der Ferne.</p>
<p>Bisher!</p>
<p>Und ja, es ist mir klar, dass im Moment die Sonne scheint und alles super ist, und irgendwann wahrscheinlich wieder Sturm und Regen und Schnee kommen und die Möwen uns das Leben zur Hölle machen werden und wir Ärger mit dem Vermieter haben usw. usf. Das weiss ich alles. Nur: derzeit ist es 💯, und ich hoffe, das bleibt auch noch eine Weile so.</p>
<p>Auch wenn es hart nach <em>woo woo</em> klinkt. <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></p>

			 <p>Seit die Menschen begannen, sich am Lagerfeuer Geschichten zu erzählen, gibt es auch Geschichten über die Mutigen und Wilden und Ungezähmten.  Über die, die vom Meer aufgezogen und geformt wurden, die auf See alles wagten und oft viel dabei verloren haben.  Mythen voller Tiefe und Geheimnisse, mit offensichtlichen Lehren für die Daheimgebliebenen, und versteckten Warnungen an diejenigen, die, inspiriert und verzaubert von den Legenden, den Mutigen nacheifern und sie überflügeln wollten.  Und <em>was</em> für Geschichten sie sich erzählen!</p>

<p>1021 betrat der isländische Entdecker Leif Eriksson als erster Europäer den amerikanischen Kontinent. Anders als bei seinem Nachahmer Kolumbus knapp 500 Jahre später war das Marketing noch nicht erfunden, daher spricht heute kaum jemand über diese Expedition.  Tragisch.</p>
<p>1401 fand Klaus Störtebeker, der berühmte Seeräuber, in Hamburg den Tod durch Enthauptung.  Der vermutlich stark alkoholisierte Freibeuter war lange Zeit der berüchtigteste Schrecken der Nord- und Ostsee.  Dramatisch.</p>
<p>1718 starb Edward Teach, besser bekannt als &ldquo;Blackbeard&rdquo;, nach einem Jahre andauernden, wahrhaft legendären Run in den Westindischen Inseln in einer Seeschlacht gegen den britischen Lieutenant Robert Maynard und dessen HMS <em>Pearl</em>.  Er war vermutlich der erste Pirat, der gezielt Make-up zur Demoralisierung seiner Opfer einsetzte. Episch.</p>
<p>2022 entriss der rauhe Wind dem Flensburger Amateurfilmschaffenden Carlo Zottmann bei der Aufnahme eines sonnigen 360°-Panoramas dessen getreue Ray Ban-Sonnenbrille und versenkte sie kurzerhand in der Förde. Die See gibt und die See nimmt.</p>

			 <p>Pünktlich zum Pfingstwochenende kam die Sonne ganztägig raus, und das Gefühl von Sommer stellte sich über die letzten paar Tage ein.  Überall gibt es Erdbeeren von umliegenden Höfen zu kaufen, die kurze Kleidung wird endgültig im Schrank nach vorn gerückt, und wie vermutlich fast überall in Europa finden in Schleswig-Holstein die ersten größeren Events und Märkte statt. In Ermangelung einer klaren Präferenz (alles ist noch neu!) haben wir uns heute für den <a href="http://www.norddeutscherkunsthandwerkermarkt.de/">Norddeutschen Kunsthandwerkermarkt in Süderschmedeby</a> entschieden.  Ja, ich weiss, das klingt etwas spießig, aber irgendwo muss man ja anfangen.</p>
<p>Auch wenn der Name es vermuten lässt, Süderschmedeby liegt nicht im Auenland, sondern ~15km südlich von Flensburg, und ist hübsch und sehr übersichtlich. Der Markt war relativ groß und gut besucht, wir fanden ungeplant einige schöne Stücke für die Küche, hatten viel zu viel Eis in der Waffel, und haben uns ganz spontan für neue Ringe entschieden — die ersten waren schließlich schon 22 Jahre alt. Und: die Schmiedin stellte uns den Schmuck innerhalb von knapp 2 Stunden vor Ort in ihrem kleinen Zelt her! 🤯</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Weil die Tage hier spürbar länger sind als im Süden, fuhren wir anschliessend noch nach Langballigau, ~10 km östlich von Flensburg, wo sich die Förde zur Ostsee hin öffnet.  Schöne Gegend und eine Hammer-Aussicht — und mittendrin ein Parkplatz-ähnlicher Wohnmobil-&ldquo;Camping&rdquo;-Platz. Also, ich weiss ja auch nicht. Klar, es sind nur 50m bis zum Strand, aber es ist auch komplett asphaltiert und bis zum nächsten Camper hat man nur 2m Platz… Aber der Spot scheint seine Fans gefunden zu haben, auch wenn ich nicht dazu gehöre.</p>
<p>Alles in allem ein schöner Abschluss einer ganz anständigen Woche.  Die erste Auftragsarbeit ist erledigt; die letzten Heimwerkerarbeiten passieren, und mit jedem Tag wird mehr wird die Wohnung mehr von <em>einer</em> Wohnung zu <em>unserer</em> Wohnung.</p>
<p>Nach und nach streifen wir das sichtbare München von uns ab.  Die Ausweise sind geändert, wir tragen keine Lederhosen, Haferlschuh oder Dirndl mehr, und seit Mittwoch hat unser Auto statt des alten <code>M</code>- ein neues <code>FL</code>-Kennzeichen. Den Teil nach dem Ortsmarker haben wir beibehalten können; alles wollen wir dann doch nicht hergeben.</p>

			 <p>Am Donnerstag startete nach zweijähriger Corona-Pause die diesjährige Rum-Regatta. Da ich bis Donnerstagvormittag auch keine Ahnung hatte, dass es das gibt und was es eigentlich ist, möchte ich <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum-Regatta">Wikipedia</a> zitieren:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Die Rum-Regatta […] ist das größte Gaffelsegler-Treffen Nordeuropas. Seit 1980 treffen sich jedes Jahr immer am Wochenende nach Christi Himmelfahrt, weit über 100 teilnehmende Schiffe auf der Flensburger Innenförde zu einer Regatta, die jedoch eher an eine &ldquo;unernste Geschwaderfahrt&rdquo; erinnert.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/schleswig-holstein/Rum-Regatta-in-Flensburg-erfolgreich-beendet,rumregatta220.html">Der NDR hat einen kurzen Beitrag dazu.</a>  Das ganze Spektakel findet in Verbindung mit dem kleinen gemütlichen Hafenfest statt.  Und zumindest am Donnerstag bei der Eröffnung spielte auch das Wetter mit: die Sonne strahlte, der Himmel war weit und blau, und die Snacks und das Bier wurden nicht sofort vom harten Regen aufgeweicht und verwässert.  Good stuff.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Das Wetter an der Förde oszilliert derzeit an 4 von 5 Tagen im 30-Minuten-Takt zwischen <em>&ldquo;Es ist Sommer, Homies!!&quot;</em> und <em>&ldquo;Odin&rsquo;s Zorn&rdquo;</em>, was Planungen im Bezug auf Kleidung zu unlösbaren Logikpuzzles machen kann.  Nach ein paar Tagen stellte sich <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Demut<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Verdruss<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ein gewisser Gleichmut ein: es ist wie es ist, ich orientiere mich an der vorausgesagten Durchschnittstemperatur für den Tag und verwerfe jegliche eventuelle Pläne für eine Langhaarfrisur.</p>
<p>Meine persönliche Entdeckung dieser Woche ist der Wald nördlich von der Wohnung direkt am Mürwiker Fördeufer.  Er ist …friedlich, ein besseres Wort zu ihm will mir nicht einfallen.  Ein alter Laubwald, trotz seiner Dichte nicht dunkel und optisch nicht erdrückend; knorrige alte Riesen mit hohen Kronen, die mich nahezu umgehend ruhig werden lassen, und eine Stille ohne Zivilisationslärm, man hört nur den Wind in den Blättern und etwas entfernt über dem Wasser.  Wir sahen wilde Hasen auf einer Wiese.  Ich folgte einem Pfad um eine Biegung und sah mich einem Reh gegenüber, keine 10m entfernt.  Dem Ausdruck <em>&ldquo;Holy shit, ein Reh!!!&quot;</em> in meinem Gesicht begnete das Reh mit einem etwas zynisch wirkenden <em>&ldquo;Holy shit, ein Stadtmensch&rdquo;</em> seinerseits — nonverbal natürlich, aber ich bin sehr naturverbunden und erkenne sowas.  Dann lief es davon, wiederum ohne große Aufregung, ein echter Power Move.  Ich weiss, dass es das respektlos meinte, aber es war auch einfach total gangster.</p>
<p>Bis jetzt dachte ich immer, Dom Toretto sei mein <em>spirit animal</em>, aber vielleicht ist es dieses Reh.  Vielleicht ist es auch eine Mischung aus beiden.</p>
<p><em>Expecto petroleum!</em></p>

			 <p>Der eigentliche Umzug war erstaunlich easy, von der zeitlichen Komponente einmal abgesehen.  Am Montagmorgen um 7:30 Uhr standen die Männer vom Umzugsunternehmen auf der Matte, knapp vier Stunden später war all unsere Habe im LKW verstaut.  Nach der Wohnungsübergabe verabschiedeten wir uns von den Nachbarn, sprangen ins Auto und starteten nordwärts.  Die knapp 12 Stunden Fahrtzeit unterhielten wir uns mit, äh, sagen wir <em>&ldquo;vintage music&rdquo;</em> (Shoutout an <a href="https://www.80s80s.de/">80s80s</a> und <a href="https://www.90s90s.de/radios/hiphop-rap">90s90s Hiphop &amp; Rap</a> im Stream!). Am Dienstagmittag war die Umzugscrew dann an der neuen Wohnung, und am späten Nachmittag war alles erledigt. Puh.</p>
<p>Und nun: <strong>Flensburger Förde, Baby!</strong> Da wären wir also.  Das neue Domizil ist sogar <em>noch</em> schöner mit uns darin, und nachdem die Möbel auch nicht mehr kreuz und quer im Weg stehen, ist es auch schon ziemlich wohnlich.  (Gut, es wäre noch noch gemütlicher, hätte ich mir nicht bei der Installation unserer massiven Miele-Waschmaschine das Kreuz verhoben, aber wenn das das einzige Problem bleibt, bin ich happy.)  Die wichtigsten Dinge sind geklärt: die Nachbarn scheinen nett zu sein; die neue Adresse steht in unseren Ausweisen; ich bin wieder selbständig; wir haben einen Stellplatz fürs Auto; wir kennen die Wege zum Recyclinghof, Baumarkt und Strand.  A propos:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Vier Worte dazu: &ldquo;1km bis zum Strand&rdquo;. <code>#happyAF</code>  Es gibt schlimmere Schicksale, finde ich!</p>
<p>Noch ein positiver Effekt: dieser Umzug markierte den Abschluss einiger großer, lang andauernder Projekte und Themen; nun, da diese hinter uns liegen, schlafen D und ich spürbar besser und ruhiger als … naja, <em>als seit Jahren.</em>  Trotz gut befahrenen Bushaltestellen direkt vor dem Fenster!  Low-level stress, it&rsquo;s (been) a thing.</p>
<p>Und wenn ich in den nächsten Tagen wieder fit bin und klar denken kann, und das Arbeitszimmer einsatzbereit ist, mache ich mir ein paar Gedanken zu meinen Plänen und den ersten Gigs.  Es soll ja nicht langweilig werden.  <code>#neverStopNeverStopping</code></p>

			 <p>Die schönen <em>&ldquo;Wir sind dann erstmal nicht mehr in München&rdquo;</em>-Parties und -Gespräche liegen hinter uns.  Die Stadt wird uns nicht fehlen, aber einige ihrer vielen Bewohner.</p>
<p>Freunde: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️, <em>would recommend</em>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Nun sitzen wir inmitten <a href="/2022/05/07/fresh-in-flensburg.html">einer überschaubaren Zahl an Umzugskisten</a> und halb-demontierter Wohnungseinrichtung in dieser etwas seltsamen Limbo-Phase eines jeden Moves: noch nicht weg, aber nicht mehr wirklich hier, und auch noch nicht dort.  Gut, &ldquo;sitzen&rdquo; ist nicht das korrekte Wort.  Wir sortieren weiter aus, räumen auf, putzen, verschenken Krams und schrauben Elektrogeräte vom Mauerwerk …</p>
<p>Die unterschwellige Anspannung wird langsam anstrengend, wir sind übermüdet und würden wirklich gern mal wieder durchschlafen.  (Bald! 😉)  Und an manchen Tagen und bei einigen Themen fühle ich mich derzeit immer mal wieder kaputt (as in <em>&ldquo;I am broken&rdquo;</em>) — und mir wird wieder bewusst, dass ich erst vor einem halben Jahr aus meiner Burnout-Auszeit zurückgekehrt bin.  Aber zum Glück muss ich nichts über&rsquo;s Knie brechen, und dieser Luxus ist 🔥🔥🔥</p>
<p>Anyways, in zwei Tagen geht&rsquo;s los.  🚚  See you on the … <em>fjord&rsquo;er</em> side!</p>
<p>HAHAHAHAHA I&rsquo;M HILARIOUS</p>

			 <p>Überall stehen Boxen und Verpackungsmaterial herum, ein sicheres Zeichen dafür, dass die letzten zwei Wochen vor dem Umzugstermin angebrochen sind.</p>
<p>Ich erinnere mich noch recht gut an unseren letzten Umzug vor ~16 Jahren.  Unser Startpunkt an diesem Tag waren 65m², unser Ziel ein Haus.  All unsere Habe verschwand in ca. 35 großen Umzugskartons, und am Abend vor dem Move waren wir ziemlich am Ende.  Zum Glück hatten wir in weiser Voraussicht zum ersten Mal in unserem Leben ein Umzugsunternehmen gebucht (<code>#adulting</code>) — bei der Vorstellung, all die Möbel und Boxen selbst bewegen zu müssen, hätten wir uns an diesem Punkt sehr wahrscheinlich spontan gegen den Umzug und für&rsquo;s Wieder-Auspacken entschieden.</p>
<p>Der Gedanke, dass wir unter Umständen einfach mehr Shit hatten als uns gut tat, kam uns erst Jahre später.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Zwischen damals und heute ist viel passiert.  Wir haben viel über uns gelernt (&ldquo;uns&rdquo; im Singular und auch Plural) und viel über Arbeitsaufträge unserer Eltern an uns (implizit &amp; explizit).  Wir haben uns emanzipiert von Ideen und Wünschen anderer Menschen.  Mein Gesicht wurde zu einem Feld, vom Leben bestellt (<code>#furchen</code> <code>#falten</code> <code>#bio</code> <code>#landwirtschaft</code> <code>#poesie</code>).</p>
<p>D und ich wurden realistischer, was unsere <em>fantasy selves</em> angeht, diese idealisierte Wahrnehmungen, die man von sich selbst hat.  Nein, wir brauchen keine 36 Teller und Tassen, weil wir eh' keine Parties ausrichten — uns reichen je 4 Teile von jedem.  Nein, ich brauche 90% von meinem Fitness-Zeugs nicht mehr, weil ich es eh kaum benutzt habe und auch nicht benutzen werde.  Nein, die Staffelei kann weg, das mit der Malerei hat nicht so funktioniert wie gehofft.  Nein, ich werde nie wieder einen PC aus diesen alten Platinen und 600m Kabeln zusammenbauen, die im Keller lagern.  Etc. etc.</p>
<p>Und hey, das ist okay!  Es ist toll, Dinge auszuprobieren — aber es ist noch toller, sich nicht daran festzuklammern und unter Druck zu setzen, man <em>müsse</em> jetzt dieses oder jenes tun oder sein, nur weil man in der Vergangenheit mal eine Idee hatte, die möglicherweise doch nicht so gut war (oder gut war, aber jetzt ihre Zeit schon hinter sich hat).  Ich muss nicht alles, was jemals in meinen Besitz gelangt ist, aufgrund absurder Eventualitäten oder abstrakt empfundener Befindlichkeiten behalten.  (Gilt auch für Geschenke und Erinnerungsstücke, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AMA<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.)</p>
<p>Und so sind es möglicherweise bei diesem Umzug auch nur 12 Kisten geworden, weil wir uns sowohl altem Zeugs als auch alter Zöpfe entledigt haben.  Wir haben viel Ballast abgeworfen, physisch und psychisch, damit unser Ballon höher fliegen kann.</p>
<p>Gute Luft hier oben.</p>

			 <p>Die große Abschiedsparty in der Firma war 1A, soviel sei gesagt.  Für mich wurde gesungen, ich durfte rappen, es wurde gegrillt, niemand blieb durstig, die Stimmung war super.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Nichtsdestotrotz: Abschied.  Die Kulmination eines ziemlich intensiv-emotionalen Monats.  Seit Montag habe ich meinen Schrank ausgeräumt und meinen Rollcontainer, diverse Accounts und &ldquo;meine&rdquo; Hardware abgegeben… hart.</p>
<p>Und auch wenn ich diese Entscheidung wohlüberlegt und freiwillig gefällt habe — traurig darf ich trotzdem sein.  (Notiz: performative Fröhlichkeit ist Bullshit. #keepItReal)</p>
<p>In den letzten Tagen wurde mir auch mehr als eine <em>&ldquo;Ich weiss noch, als Du damals …&quot;</em>-Geschichte von meinen Freunde und Kollegen erzählt.  Große, kleine, ernste und alberne Momente, von mir längst vergessen, für meine Gegenüber aber untrennbar verbunden mit ihrem mentalen Bild von mir.  Ich mag diese Geschichten; durch sie sehe ich mich ganz kurz mit den Augen der Anderen.  Ich bin definitiv nicht das Zentrum des Universum, aber die wichtigste Person in meiner Welt, und diese Stories und Momentaufnahmen helfen mir dabei, meine Selbst- und Aussenwahrnehmung abzugleichen und mich zu kalibrieren.  Und nicht zuletzt kann dieses gemeinsame Zurückschauen auch einfach nur verdammt schön sein. :)</p>
<p>Einmal mehr fiel mir dabei wieder der folgende Absatz aus Kim Stanley Robinson&rsquo;s tollem Buch <a href="https://literal.club/czottmann/book/the-years-of-rice-and-salt-x7mgb">“The Years of Rice and Salt&rdquo;</a> ein:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Because that&rsquo;s what we are to other people, boy, we are their gossip. That&rsquo;s all civilization is, a giant mill grinding out gossip. And so I could be the story of the man who rode high and fell hard, and had his spirit broken and crawled off into a hole like a dog, to die as soon as he could manage it. Or I could be the story of a man who rode high and fell hard, and then got up defiant, and walked away in a new direction.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey, that&rsquo;s me! I rode, I fell, I got up again.  Kann und möchte nicht mehr so weitermachen wie bisher, aber es ist wirklich schön, dass es nicht an den Leuten liegt, mit denen ich mich umgebe.  Die bleiben mir hoffentlich erhalten, wenn auch aus der Ferne. Nicht weg, nur anders.</p>
<p>Hoffentlich.  Ich werde mir Mühe geben.</p>

			 <p><strong>Leere Zimmer sind selten wirklich leer, glaube ich.</strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Sie wirken halt leer, weil die Möglichkeiten, Chancen und Träume, die sie enthalten, unsichtbar sind.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Dieser verdammt blumige Gedanke kam mir in den Sinn, als ich mich mit dem freundlichen Vermieter in unserer schönen, neuen Wohnung traf.  Gut möglich, dass die neuen Schlüssel in meiner Hand ein <em>contact high</em> ausgelöst haben, das dieses Bild in meinem Kopf erzeugte, aber mir gefällt es.</p>
<p>Die Nachmittagssonne fiel durch die etwas staubigen Fenster auf den ebenso staubigen Laminatboden, und ich hatte einen dieser Augenblicke, in denen die Zukunft mir ungefragt eine ihrer kurzen Slideshows reindrückte: die Anordnung von Möbeln; D und ich in der Küche beim Kochen (Eintopf und/ oder Kaffee); Frühstück am Sonntag auf dem Balkon; eine Haarbürste auf diesem Wandvorsprung im Bad; Freunde zu Besuch; der Sound des österreichischen <a href="https://fm4.orf.at/">Radio FM4</a> in der Luft (bester Sender, egal was D sagt!).  Alles ist offen!</p>
<p>Ich glaube, das wird gut.</p>
<p>Nur über die gerade anlaufende Abschiedsphase in München möchte ich im Moment nicht nachdenken, denn die wird/ ist beinhart.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Eine Frage treibt mich allerdings ein wenig um:</strong> was macht ein Zimmer <em>an sich</em> aus?  Gehören die Wände zum Raum (A) <em>oder</em> ist der Raum nur der luftige Teil zwischen den Wänden (B)?  Wenn wir Zimmer bemaßen, vermessen wir regular nämlich nur Letzteres.</p>
<p><strong>Bonusfrage,</strong> falls Antwort B korrekt ist (was sie ist): gehört die Tapete an der Wand in dem Fall zum Raum oder zur Wand?</p>

			 <p><strong>Flensburg also.</strong></p>
<p>Der Wunsch, irgendwann vielleicht einmal im Hohen Norden der Republik zu wohnen, in Nähe des Meers, den hatte D schon, als wir uns kennenlernten, glaube ich.  Jahreszahlen begannen damals mit &ldquo;1&rdquo;, ich fuhr einen halbwegs neuen Golf II, und mangelnde Lebenserfahrung glichen wir mit diesem freshen Dreisatz aus Hotness, Blauäugigkeit und dynamischem Auftreten aus, den man nur mit Anfang 20 erfolgreich hinbekommt.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Die Küste lockte mit Urlaubserinnerungen: mit der <em>Gewissheit</em>, dass dort definitiv auf jeden Fall selbstverständlich immer die Sonne scheint; mit dem fest im Kopf verankerten Gefühl von Sand in Unterwäsche und unter den Füßen; mit den Flashbacks an diesen Moment als Teenager, in dem ich begriff, dass das Meer, auf das ich blickte, schon immer da war und in seiner Unermesslichkeit alles überdauern wird, resultierend in einem tiefen Gefühl von Ehrfurcht.  (Dass zwei dieser drei &ldquo;Wahrheiten&rdquo; lediglich darauf beruhten, dass ich immer nur in Sommermonaten dort war — geschenkt.)</p>
<p>Die Ostsee war immer dieser Ort, den man im Urlaub sieht und geniesst, um dann den Rest des Jahres diesen zwei, drei Wochen nachzuschmachten und dem nächsten Trip entgegenzufiebern.  Diesen Status Quo ernsthaft zu hinterfragen, das war mir ein zu hoher emotionaler Aufwand.</p>
<p>Ausserdem: war ich nicht erst <em>vor Kurzem</em> nach München gezogen? (1998.) Und diese Stadt war doch rundum großartig, warum sollte ich ihr den Rücken kehren? (Zu viele saudumm große Autos. Die Söder&rsquo;sche Kreativität beim &ldquo;Dagegen&rdquo;. Zu viel NIMBY<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Mietpreise, nur noch angemessen für Erben aus Familiendynastien. Charme-Komprimierung durch aggressive Flächen-Verdichtung in allen Stadtvierteln.)</p>
<p>Aber München war gut zu mir!  Extrem gut, um ehrlich zu sein.  Mit Arbeitswillen und Offenheit und einer anständigen Portion Glück konnten wir uns Ein Gutes Leben™ aufbauen. Minijobs wurden zu Jobs, wurden zu Selbständigkeit, wurde zu einem Startup plus Shutdown, gefolgt von mehr Freelancing, und dann etwas Großem. Ich fand Freunde. In München befand sich nicht nur mein Heim, es war meine Heimat.</p>
<p>Dann kam die Pandemie mit ihren Lockdowns und diesem omnipräsenten Gefühl von Angst um die Meinen und um mich; viel zu viel Arbeit im Namen von Umweltschutz und Müllvermeidung; später ein Burnout mit gerade noch abgewendetem Crash, und Auszeit mit Luft zum Nachdenken und Abwägen.  Und mit vielen Gesprächen, an deren Ende einige große Entscheidungen standen.  Eine davon: D und ich werden demnächst vor Ort dauerhaft unsere Vermutungen und Gewissheiten über den Norden überprüfen, und schauen, wohin der Wind uns treibt.  Flensburg ist dafür <em>mindestens</em> eine wirklich hübsche, sehr gute erste Station.</p>
<p>Bin gespannt, was mich und uns erwartet.  In einem Monat kommt der Umzugswagen.  Let&rsquo;s do this!  🎉</p>

			 <p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a decent macOS+iOS streaming radio player, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/broadcasts/id1469995354?l=en">Broadcasts</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really good, universal app, with an optional one-time purchase of €6 to get both macOS and iOS app (unless 5 stations are enough for you, in that case it&rsquo;s free). It feels native on both platforms, which is a rarity these days. Comes with Applescript support, iCloud sync, an integrated station search and support for custom stations (name, URL, logo image).</p>
<p>I bought the full version on day 3.</p>

<p>Detail adds a virtual multi-POV camera to your Mac — based on the built-in camera, your iPhone cam, maybe a connected DSLR etc. Plus it comes with automatic face tracking.

			 <p>If you want to start 2022 right re your mental well-being, you can do worse than setting up NextDNS for your network. It&rsquo;s is a system-wide set-and-forget tracking/ad blocker, either for your home network and/or just a laptop and/or your phone. The net becomes so much saner with it. They have a generous free plan which should be more than enough for most people.</p>
<p>Go here to check it out: <a href="https://nextdns.io/?from=52h923e4">NextDNS.io</a> (Disclaimer: that&rsquo;s an affiliate link, yes, but I&rsquo;m a long-time, happy, paying customer of theirs and I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it if it wasn&rsquo;t as stellar as it is. If you don&rsquo;t care about that affiliate stuff, visit <a href="https://nextdns.io/">https://nextdns.io/</a> instead.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started using it on just my laptop over a year ago just to give it a spin; about two weeks later I graduated to a paid plan (less than €2/month, cheap!!) because it&rsquo;s just so useful.  The results:</p>
<ol>
<li>less bandwidth use</li>
<li>almost no tracking in websites or apps</li>
<li>reclaimed sanity since I don&rsquo;t see many ads anymore</li>
<li>a much better web browsing experience without the need for browser addons</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve set it up for my whole home network, using my router, and I&rsquo;ve configured it to my liking. For example, in my house <em>Facebook does not exist</em> anymore. Your preferred setup might look different, but it&rsquo;s easy to adjust, really.</p>
<p>If you have questions, please let me know, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to answer them.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://zottmann.org/2021/07/10/til-that-ios.html">TIL that iOS Shortcuts is a bit particular when it comes to photos</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few months ago I&rsquo;ve built a simple iOS shortcut for quickly snapping a photo and sending it to a fixed email address.  Its first action/block was &ldquo;Take Photo&rdquo;, it had always worked fine, right from the start.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today when I had just finished setting up my new iPhone. I triggered the shortcut, a picture was taken and then … an error message: <em>The file &ldquo;Camera 2021-07-10 09-10-11.png doesn&rsquo;t exist.&quot;</em>  I&rsquo;ll spare you the story about the ensuing hour of debugging but in the end, it was a simple fix.</p>
<p>I just had to open the Camera app and manually snap a regular picture <em>once</em>. Apparently that then created some hidden folder behind a dusty curtain in the darkest depths of iOS which Shortcuts needs but can&rsquo;t create itself.  On the previous iPhone I had used the camera for weeks before getting into Shortcuts, so that issue never arose — but on the fresh device I hadn&rsquo;t bothered with the Camera app and instead went straight into automation mode.</p>
<p>After that, my shortcut just worked fine.  What an obscure bug, though.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a> is a handy little CLI tool to work with CSV and JSON data. Its v3.10 update introduced a new <code>memory</code> command that makes it trivially easy to pass raw data into the tool without extra steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new <code>sqlite-utils memory</code> command can import CSV and JSON data directly into an in-memory SQLite database, combine and query it using SQL and output the results as CSV, JSON or various other formats of plain text tables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example — fetching a JSON file of <a href="https://recup.de/">public RECUP locations</a>, then printing a table of whose name contains &ldquo;cafe&rdquo;, sorted by ZIP code:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>In his <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jun/19/sqlite-utils-memory/">announcement blog post for v3.10</a>, author Simon Willison also showed how to combine different sources of data, i.e. different files, using <code>sqlite-utils</code>.  Pretty exciting stuff.  🤯</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have <em>fun</em> with this!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When accessing different git repo hosts (GitHub, GitLab etc.) via HTTPS it&rsquo;s necessary to enter your credentials. Fortunately, git offers a convenient way to automate this process by securely storing your credentials.</p>
<p>First, I needed to enable the credential helper:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt; git config credential.helper store
</code></pre><p>Next up, I cloned a remote repository via HTTPS. git asked for the personal GitHub access token I previously generated (on GitHub under <code>Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens</code>):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt; git clone https://carlo@github.com/carlo/whatever-whatever.git
Cloning into 'whatever-whatever'...
Password for 'https://carlo@github.com': 
</code></pre><p>Once I entered the password, my login info was saved in <code>~/.git-credentials</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt; cat ~/.git-credentials
https://carlo:ghp\_XM…………………………………………………………………OXRLVaI……@github.com
</code></pre><p>Naturally, I prefer using SSH but for those times when that&rsquo;s not an option, my life got easier because I learned about the credentials storage.</p>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/fix-git-user-credentials-for-https/">this TecMint article</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential-store">the <code>git-credential-store</code> documentation</a> for teaching me new things.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t overstate how important this ruling is. Young climate activists sued against the law, basically saying <em>&ldquo;Stop offloading this shit on us&rdquo;</em>, and our supreme court agreed. So great.</p>

<p>Hard to watch at times but really good nonetheless. It feels like an honest look at humans dealing with their mental health and their sense of self — and the stupid stigmata that come with the territory. Hard subjects, and still has some light-hearted moment and feels hopeful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, two emerging technologies may propel NASA and the rest of the world into an era of faster, low-cost exploration. Instead of spending a decade or longer planning and developing a mission, then spending hundreds of millions (to billions!) of dollars bringing it off, perhaps we can fly a mission within a couple of years for a few tens of millions of dollars. This would lead to more exploration and also democratize access to the Solar System.</p>
<p>In recent years, a new generation of companies is developing new rockets for small satellites that cost roughly $10 million for a launch. […] The concept of interplanetary small satellite missions also spurred interest in the emerging new space industry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you care about progressive causes, then woke capitalism is not your friend. It is actively impeding the cause, siphoning off energy, and deluding us into thinking that change is happening faster and deeper than it really is. When people talk about the “excesses of the left”—a phenomenon that blights the electoral prospects of progressive parties by alienating swing voters—in many cases they’re talking about the jumpy overreactions of corporations that aren’t left-wing at all.</p>

			 <p>Novelist <a href="http://www.kschroeder.com/weblog/the-deepening-paradox">Karl Schroeder has an intriguing possible answer</a> to Fermi&rsquo;s Paradox, i.e. the question <em>&ldquo;Where are all those aliens?&quot;</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lately been trumpeting my revision of Clarke&rsquo;s Law (which originally said &lsquo;any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic&rsquo;). My revision says that <strong>any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from Nature</strong>. […] Basically, either advanced alien civilizations don&rsquo;t exist, or we can&rsquo;t see them because they are indistinguishable from natural systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He proposes that an advanced civilization will inevitably reach a thermodynamic equilibrium with its surroundings. Since we try to detect alien civs via their waste products (heat, light, other radiation) we might not see them. Compelling idea.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve just finished moving my entire blog to Micro.blog.  Hello M.b!  There were a few stragglers (M.b has some issues when importing Markdown files with quotes in front-end matter &ldquo;title&rdquo; fields) but I&rsquo;m good now — settling in, shaping my new virtual couch cushions to my liking, etc.</p>
<p>My blog posts go back to 2002.  I started blogging a bit earlier than that, actually, but I&rsquo;ve pruned the archive over the years because not all those morsels stood the test of time.  Nothing serious, nothing terrible, just some light dosage of Applied Forgetting. It&rsquo;s permitted and it&rsquo;s possible because this here content is mine, it never touched Facebook or its ilk, and every time I moved to another site, engine, destination on my journey, I would pack my bags and take that content with me.</p>
<p>That should be the most natural thing on the net … yet somehow it still is kind of special, isn&rsquo;t it. We might yet get there, though. More people are waking up to the idea of owning their data. Ace!</p>

<p>I usually resort to asking those folks (friendly but firmly) to please put their mask over their corona holes and that usually works. But… man, it bums me out every single time.</p>

It keeps its owner from making calls (more precise: there&rsquo;s a 50:50 chance microphone and speaker will shut off after making a speaker call, it&rsquo;s a known issue and we&rsquo;re still waiting for a fix); she&rsquo;s got an electrical shock hitting her ear while using in-ears; the charge drops like a brick from 100% to 20% within 2h and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a 3rd-party app issue.</p>

			 <p>They are not special, but they&rsquo;re mine.  I&rsquo;ve distilled them down over the last few years; they are a result of me getting a sense of who I am, together with what a person I want to be.</p>
<p>(Wow, that sounded way less pretentious in my mind.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be a dick.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t fuck it all up.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t forget to be kind.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t delay having fun.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t stop moving, ever.</li>
</ol>
<p>Turns out that for me, they kind of cover every imaginable situation. And yes, I broke all of them in the past, too. I just try really hard to not let it happen again.</p>
<p>Allow me to quickly go through them.</p>
<h3 id="1-dont-be-a-dick">1. Don&rsquo;t be a dick.</h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty self-explanatory, I think. I try to be respectful, or neutral at least, even if the other person is wrong in my eyes. Even if they are, there&rsquo;s usually something I don&rsquo;t know about them or their lives that made them that way. If I have to, I can behave like an adult when disagreeing.</p>
<p>(The only exception are nazis and people who think themselves superior to others due to the circumstances of their birth. Fuck &lsquo;em, I have no time for that shit.)</p>
<h3 id="2-dont-fuck-it-all-up">2. Don&rsquo;t fuck it all up.</h3>
<p>I try to keep the number of personal regrets I have as low as possible, so when making a somewhat important decision I usually make it deliberately. I do that both in my daily work and in my daily life.</p>
<p>Meaning, I know that even most of the bad decisions I&rsquo;ve made in the past I&rsquo;ve made after weighing my options carefully and going with what I felt was right and good at the time. It might sound silly but… I can&rsquo;t be mad at that. Past Carlo did his best to not let Present Carlo down, and Present Carlo does his best to not let Future Carlo down, you know?</p>
<h3 id="3-dont-forget-to-be-kind">3. Don&rsquo;t forget to be kind.</h3>
<p>I got that from the 12th Doctor, basically, and it&rsquo;s a beautiful notion. A little kindness goes a long way, even if it&rsquo;s just a smile at the right time. <em>&ldquo;Leave the place a little better than you&rsquo;ve found it&rdquo;</em>, etc.  Even if I have to tell someone that I don&rsquo;t have time for them right now, I will do it in a friendly way.</p>
<h3 id="4-dont-delay-having-fun">4. Don&rsquo;t delay having fun.</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very easy for me to get swept up in work, I know that by now.  Unfortunately, I needed a rule to remind me to not postpone the good life and shenanigans if possible.  I&rsquo;m getting better at this, little by little. 😋</p>
<h3 id="5-dont-stop-moving-ever">5. Don&rsquo;t stop moving, ever.</h3>
<p>I know people who at some point in their life decided they&rsquo;re &ldquo;done&rdquo; as a person, and they&rsquo;re usually a boring bunch. Stagnation is the silent killer. So I try to pick up new things and learn new stuff and open up to new people etc. All the time! And every time I do I gain something new!  For example, I got a longboard two years ago, it&rsquo;s ace.  And I started rapping last year, recording songs, performing in front of people.  (Side note: I&rsquo;m 46.)  I&rsquo;m not very good, I don&rsquo;t aim for making it big, I don&rsquo;t do it as much as I&rsquo;d like, I am nervous AF every single time the beat starts, but… man, I am alive! That must never stop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like finding new pieces for a big-ass puzzle you thought looked kinda finished but really, <em>really</em> isn&rsquo;t, not even close.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s be excellent to eachother, people ❤️</p>

			<h1><a href="https://zottmann.org/2020/06/21/bearing-my-new.html">💻 Bearing, my new macOS helper tool for Bear.app</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://zottmann.org/2020/06/21/bearing-my-new.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-06-21 18:54:00 &#43;0200">Jun 21, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <h4 id="tldr">TL;DR</h4>
<p>I built a little helper tool named <strong>Bearing</strong> which allows for scripting Bear. It adds to Bear&rsquo;s own capabilites by slightly abstracting and enhancing the experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>There&rsquo;s a dedicated <code>bearing</code> CLI tool that accepts plain arguments.  No more <code>bear://…</code> calls, no more URL-encoding anything.</li>
<li>The CLI tool returns callback responses as JSON.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://github.com/carlo/bearing">https://github.com/carlo/bearing</a></p>
<h4 id="why">Why?</h4>
<p>A few weeks back I switched from Evernote to <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a>.  I like Bear a lot (Markdown!) but its lack of Applescript support is irritating. Out of the box, Bear can be automated using <a href="https://bear.app/faq/X-callback-url%20Scheme%20documentation/">its x-callback-url API</a>, yes. But you don&rsquo;t get any return values for those calls in a simple way.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s why all existing Bear-related scripts go H.A.M. on its SQLite DB. The <a href="https://bear.app/faq/Where%20are%20Bear's%20notes%20located/">Bear FAQs say the following</a> about that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For most users in most situations, we highly recommend not [to work with Bear&rsquo;s database]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great. Also: understandable. That led to me setting out to build a simple wrapper app so I could work with Bear from command line and scripts in a easy and structured way without putting the notes database at risk.</p>
<h4 id="what-can-it-do">What can it do?</h4>
<p>Example: Creating a note</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>/usr/local/bin/bearing \
  create \
  --title=&quot;Bearing test note&quot; \
  --text=&quot;Works for me!&quot;
</code></pre><p>… returns …</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{
  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Bearing test note&quot;,
  &quot;identifier&quot;: &quot;4963F8B4-3FE0-4835-B96D-7DCCB6101A62-1917-00013DC4BC4EE819&quot;,
  &quot;_success&quot;: true
}
</code></pre><p>Searching, tagging, editing etc are supported, as is everything else the x-callback-url API allows for. :)</p>

			 <p>A few days ago I started <strong>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Origins</strong> on PS4 after buying the complete edition during a PSN sale, and hoo boy, what a game. Absolutely stunning, lovely atmosphere, so much to do (duh, it&rsquo;s a Ubisoft game), and I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;ve seen less than 20% of it so far. 👍🏼</p>
<p>I was about to write <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve played most AC games&rdquo;</em> but after taking a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed#Release_history">the release history</a> I realize I was wrong. 😅 Anyways, I put AC on ice when I got series fatigue after finishing <em>Unity</em>, so that means I&rsquo;ve never played <em>Syndicate</em>, <em>Origins</em> or <em>Odyssey</em>.</p>
<p><em>Origins</em>, then. It&rsquo;s nice and YOU CAN RIDE CAMELS 🐪🐫, and it keeps me from feeling guilty for putting <em>Witcher III</em> on hold halfway through.</p>

<p>You know how it goes.</p>
<p>Today I decided to give Micro.blog a shot; these days, I want my hurdles for blogging &amp; posting low, and even running my own Hugo-powered blog is a bit too much.  I&rsquo;ve a life to run, damn it!</p>
<p>Anyways, hej hej!  I&rsquo;m Carlo, I hail from Europe 🇪🇺, I&rsquo;m CTO of #German #sustainability <a href="https://recup.de/">company RECUP</a> (we&rsquo;re building a deposit system for reusable coffee-to-go cups). 💚 I&rsquo;m a software dev, I love me some good PS4 videogames 🎮, I try to be the best husband I can be, I&rsquo;m a P.U.N.K.

<p>Both exciting and depressing AF. But to be honest, these days that rings true for many a topic, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day, gene therapy may help with the rarest of diseases. Some parents aren’t waiting. […]</p>
<p>I asked [neurologist Christopher Janson] if he thought it was fair that the Landsmans’ kids could  end up getting treated while some other family without a surprise  GoFundMe success would not be. <em>“Unfortunately, there are a lot of things  in society that are not fair,”</em> he said. <em>“There are parents who want to  see me in my neurology clinic and can’t because they don’t have  insurance. We have a problem in society.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, we absolutely do. It&rsquo;s not as prevalent here in Germany as it is in the US, but still.</p>

<p>That is a great word. So far I&rsquo;ve only came across the somewhat common <em>&ldquo;everything&rsquo;s going downhill from here&rdquo;</em> but <em>&ldquo;nowstalgia&rdquo;</em> is so much funnier (even though it is less self-explanatory).</p>

<p>Being a dead actor/singer doesn&rsquo;t mean anymore you have to stop working:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some actors and movie studios are buckling down and preparing for an inevitable future when using scanning technology to preserve 3-D digital replicas of performers is routine. Just because your star is inconveniently dead doesn’t mean your generation-spanning blockbuster franchise can’t continue to rake in the dough. Get the tech right and you can cash in on superstars and iconic characters forever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest: I&rsquo;ve no idea how to feel about this. I can see the reasoning behind scanning and preserving actors for legitimate purposes<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but I won&rsquo;t be surprised when (not if) some of those scans are leaked to seedy underground porn producers.

<p>Within decades, neurotechnology could  cause social disruption on a scale that would make smartphones and the  internet look like gentle ripples on the pond of history.</p>
<p>Most unsettling, neurotechnology confounds age-old answers to this question: What is a human being?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lengthy read giving a short history of DARPA with a focus on their (published) neurotechnology research and its challenges. While I don&rsquo;t think the agency&rsquo;s goals are <em>quite</em> as benign as it makes them out to be, I find the entire field utterly fascinating and am well in favor of what they are trying to accomplish.</p>

			 <p>My revamped blog is now live at this here new domain, <a href="https://czm.io/">czm.io</a>.</p>
<p>Moved to a shorter domain, switched to a Hugo + Gitlab + Forestry + Netlify setup. It&rsquo;s still a static site, it&rsquo;s still super-fast, it&rsquo;s still devoid of any tracking and analytics. (I just don&rsquo;t care about <em>those</em> numbers.)</p>
<p>The heart of the site is a <a href="https://gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> repo. Netlify runs Hugo &amp; serves the site every time changes are pushed to the repo. Forestry (CMS) is committing to the repo. Convenient AF.</p>
<p>This warrants a longer post …later. Until then, a few quick take-aways:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>: ★★★★★ It&rsquo;s just <em>made</em> for building &amp; hosting static sites. Aside from setting up their free custom SSL certificates you can pretty much configure everything via a config file in your repo. Ace.</li>
<li><a href="https://forestry.io" title="Forestry">Forestry</a>: ★★★★★ CMS for a static sites (Hugo- or jekyll-based). Slick, super-easy to set up once you got Hugo and Netlify going. Having that thing is game-changing.</li>
<li><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>: ★★★★ Crazy fast static site generator, it&rsquo;s made a solid impression on me so far. The templating syntax takes a bit getting-used-to, though.</li>
<li><a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a>: ★★★★ CSS framework. Me no designer but Bulma nice</li>

<p>Interesting article in the The Atlantic about subdermal microchips, discussing a few health-focussed implants and related research.</p>

<p>These days, my RFID tag carries some emergency data but nothing else (name, birthdate, blood type, city of residence). I wish it could do more, tho.</p>

<li>Verwirrung (<em>&ldquo;Ist die Mail überhaupt angekommen?&quot;</em>)</li>
<li>Selbstzweifel (<em>&ldquo;Ignorieren die mich, weil ich nicht geeignet bin?&quot;</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Für etwas mehr Respekt für die Bewerbenden &amp; Miteinander auf Augenhöhe! DANKE.</p>

<p>theatlantic.com</p>
<p>Kommunikation auf der Straße findet nicht nur zwischen den Autos bzw. ihren Fahrern statt, sondern auch zwischen Automobilen, Fußgängern, Radfahrern etc. Bisher ist das kein großes Problem — ein großer Teil der nonverbalen Verständigung zwischen Verkehrsteilnehmern funktioniert sehr gut über Blickkontakt. Aber was, wenn eine Seite keinen Blickkontakt mehr erwidern <em>kann</em>, weil es sich dabei um ein selbstfahrendes Auto oder eine Lieferdrone handelt? Das ist ein interessantes neues Forschungsfeld.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;From our standpoint, autonomous vehicles and self-driving systems will happen,” [Chris Rockwell, CEO and founder of design consulting firm Lextant]added. “It’s kind of an inevitability. But the challenge won’t be around the technology as much as it will be around the psychology. It’s going to be critical to gain trust—and that trust can be designed into these systems. Trust not only with the passengers, but also the pedestrians outside.”</em></p>

<p>heise.de <em>Drive.ai, ein neues Start-up für autonomes Fahren, macht Interaktionen mit Menschen deshalb zu einem wesentlichen Teil seiner Strategie. Das Unternehmen, für das viele Künstliche-Intelligenz-Forscher von der Stanford University arbeiten, entwickelt wie andere ein System, das sich darauf trainieren lässt, Daten von Sensoren zu interpretieren und ein Fahrzeug zu steuern. Ungewöhnlicher aber ist: Gleichzeitig beschäftigen sich die Entwickler mit Möglichkeiten, wie Autos Regeln für das Verhalten von Autofahrern und Fußgängern erlernen könnten. In den nächsten Wochen will drive.ai in Kalifornien mit Tests von autonomen Fahrzeugen beginnen, die über Anzeigen und Audiosignale mit Fußgängern kommunizieren.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Selbstfahrende Autos ändern alles!&rdquo; Das habe auch ich schon mehr als einmal gesagt, aber beim Singularity Hub gibts eine kurze, knackige Aufstellung darüber, was für Veränderungen das sind oder sein könnten. Größte Überraschung: wenn die Akzeptanz für autonomes Fahren steigt, könnte der Wert bzw. das Ansehen für Luxuskarossen einbrechen. Was macht das mit Bentley, Mercedes, Rolls Royce, BMW, Lexus…? Interessantes Gedankenspiel.</p>
<p><em>In a presentation at Singularity University’s first annual Global Summit, Brad Templeton informed attendees, “Self-driving cars are going to change the world.”</em></p>
<p><em>You may have heard that before—but if anyone has the credentials to back up a statement like this, it’s Templeton. A software architect, internet entrepreneur, and board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, he’s been a consultant on Google’s team designing a driverless car, and he regularly lectures and blogs about automated transportation. His presentation gave details on the industries and areas of our lives that will be disrupted by the advent of self-driving cars.</em></p>

<p>So beeindruckend die Technik schon ist und in 1-2 Jahren auch sein wird, die breite Masse der Bevölkerung ist bestenfalls skeptisch im Bezug auf selbstfahrende Automobile. Das haben wir noch nie so gemacht, unsere Unfälle bauen wir gefälligst immer noch selbst, bitt&rsquo;schön!</p>
<p><em>In recent weeks, BMW and Ford each announced ambitious plans to have fully self-driving cars on the market by 2021. Richard Holman, the head of foresight and trends for General Motors, has said that he expects to see self-driving cars available to the public by 2020.</em></p>
<p><em>But consumers still tend to see autonomous cars as a wild idea that fits better in a sci-fi novel than their own garages.</em></p>

<p>Kanadische Wissenschaftler vermelden einen Durchbruch in der Krebsbehandlung. Ihre neuartigen &ldquo;Nanoroboter&rdquo;, die aus über 100 Mio begeißelten Bakterien ( <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellum">Wikipedia</a>) bestehen, manövrieren selbständig durch den Blutstrom des Patienten und spüren die hypoxischen Zonen eines Krebsgeschwürs auf. Diese Zonen sind mit Sauerstoff unterversorgt, und sprechen nicht auf herkömmliche Therapien an. Die Studie bezieht sich auf die erfolgreiche Behandlung von Mäusen, aber die neue Technologie dieser Nanotransporter ist sehr vielversprechend, weil sie die Tür für neue Agens in Therapien, Analyse und Diagnose öffnet, die so bisher noch nicht möglich waren.</p>
<p><em>Researchers from Polytechnique Montréal, Université de Montréal, and McGill University have designed a new cancer-drug-delivery nanotransporter system using more than 100 million flagellated, self-propelled bacteria that are capable of navigating through the bloodstream to administer a drug to tumors with precision.* The goal of the research is to avoid jeopardizing the integrity of organs and surrounding healthy tissues while reducing drug dosage.</em></p>
<p><em>In an experiment with mice reported in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, the researchers confirmed that “the drug’s propelling force was enough to travel efficiently and enter deep inside the tumors,” autonomously detecting the oxygen-depleted tumor areas and delivering the drug to them, said Professor Sylvain Martel […]</em></p>

Denen fehlt es oft am Nötigsten für ihre Arbeit, etwa an einfachen Pipetten, Trichtern oder genau passenden Halterungen.</em></p>
<p><em>Badens Idee: Die Kollegen sollen sich das fehlende Material einfach ausdrucken. &ldquo;Wenn die Ausstattung der Labore besser wäre, gäbe es einen Schneeballeffekt, und der Anschluss an die internationale Wissenschaft könnte gelingen.&rdquo; Begabte afrikanische Forscher würden dann ihre Länder voranbringen, statt abzuwandern.</em></p>

<p><em>Kinder lernen ziemlich schnell, was passiert, wenn sie zum Beispiel einen mit Saft gefüllten Becher umdrehen. Roboter dagegen verstehen erst einmal überhaupt nichts. Forscher am Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (Ai2) in Seattle wollen das ändern: Sie haben ein Computer-Programm entwickelt, das Maschinen beibringen soll, wie von einer Kamera erfasste Objekte sich am wahrscheinlichsten verhalten werden. Dies könnte ihnen dabei helfen, Fehler zu vermeiden, so dass zum Beispiel autonome Autos besser mit ungewöhnlichen Situationen zurechtkommen würden.</em></p>

<p>Unsere Bildungssysteme müssen sich ändern, oder wir bzw. nachfolgende Generationen werden massiv überrollt. Kinder sollten nicht weiterhin darauf gedrillt werden, alte und ggf. nicht mehr zeitgemäße Unterrichtsstoffe stupide zu wiederholen. Der Fokus sollte darauf liegen, wie man sich Daten und Wissen beschafft und erarbeitet, diese zu brauchbaren Informationen kombiniert, und mit ihnen umgeht. Und das sollten sie jederzeit bei Bedarf wiederholen können. Schließlich ist abzusehen, dass sich die meisten (alle?) Arbeitsfelder in 20 Jahren noch schneller ändern werden, als es jetzt schon der Fall ist, neue Daten und neues Wissen aber jederzeit verfügbar sein werden. Diese Situation zu ignorieren ist ein Verbrechen an den Jüngeren.</p>
<p><em>Robots are taking all the jobs. But are we, the average, moderately skilled humans, screwed, or aren&rsquo;t we? Let me just get it out of the way now: We are, unless there are drastic, immediate changes to education and economic systems around the world. […]</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The jobs that the robots will leave for humans will be those that require thought and knowledge. In other words, only the best-educated humans will compete with machines,&rdquo; Howard Rheingold, an internet sociologist, told Pew. &quot; <strong>And education systems in the US and much of the rest of the world are still sitting students in rows and columns, teaching them to keep quiet and memorize what is told to them, preparing them for life in a 20th century factory.</strong>”</em></p>

<p><em>AeroFarms and other companies developing similar controlled growing climates claim to be transforming agriculture. Proponents of vertical farming call it the “third green revolution”, analogizing the developments to Apple and Tesla.

<p>Materialwissenschaftler der Washington University in St. Louis (USA) habe eine leichte, kostengünstige und skalierbare Lösung zur Wasserfiltrierung entwickelt, die auf übereinander gelegten Schichten von Graphenoxid und Nanozellulose basiert. Das geschichtete Material wird wie eine Decke auf schmutziges Wasser geworfen; Sonneneinstrahlung heizt das oben liegende Graphenoxid auf, was die von der darunter befindlichen Zellulose angesaugte Flüssigkeit verdunsten lässt. Das saubere Wasser sammelt sich auf der obersten Schicht, wo es einfach abgeschöpft werden kann.</p>
<p><em>The new biofoam is also extremely light and inexpensive to make, making it a viable tool for water purification and desalination.</em></p>
<p><em>“Cellulose can be produced on a massive scale,” Singamaneni said, “and graphene oxide is extremely cheap — people can produce tons, truly tons, of it. Both materials going into this are highly scalable. So one can imagine making huge sheets of the biofoam.”</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Warum fürchten wir den technischen Fortschritt so sehr?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Es ist eine anthropologische Angst, die in uns steckt. In Erwartung des Unbekannten, des Ungewissen, des Unerwarteten sind wir immer besorgt. Wir sollten darüber hinwegkommen und uns wie Erwachsene verhalten. Denn das reale Problem ist die Art, wie wir unsere derzeitigen Gesellschaften gestaltet haben. Das schnelle und große Anhäufen von Reichtum bei einigen wenigen. Wir haben es nicht geschafft, eine konsumorientierte Gesellschaft zu bilden, die Wohlstand und Fortschritt fair verteilt.</em></p>

<p>Unsere Werkzeuge werden exponentiell besser, und das bedeutet auch, dass wir größer denken können, und die Details diesen verbesserten Werkzeugen überlassen können. Erklärungen am Beispiel einer Architektin.</p>
<p><em>If an architect designing a house wants to move a wall, she has to first imagine all the possible alternatives of that wall’s placement that will serve her design. Once she has parsed through the possibilities in her mind, she will make a decision and manually move that wall in her CAD drawing. Naturally, she can only imagine a certain number of possibilities, and many alternatives might be completely lost because she didn’t imagine them. […]</em></p>
<p><em>But in recent years a new era of design has been creeping into the picture: generative design. […]</em></p>
<p><em>Generative design uses algorithms to explore entire solution sets. You state your goals and constraints and <strong>allow the computer to generate designs and iterations for you that you might never have thought of</strong> — a kind of accelerated artificial evolution, as some have called it.</em></p>

<p>Google verbraucht massiv viel Energie — seine Datencenter auf der ganzen Welt sind zwar schon so energiesparend wie menschenmöglich gebaut, aber die schiere Masse an Servern erzeugt natürlich trotzdem einen immens hohen Stromverbrauch. Ein großer Teil davon entfällt auf die Kühlung der Hardware. Google hat vor Kurzem die DeepMind-KI auf einige Datencenter &ldquo;losgelassen&rdquo;, und dem System Zugriff auf Sensoren und diverse Kontrollmechanismen gegeben. DM&rsquo;s Algorithmen haben dann viele unterschiedliche Variationen ausprobiert: das Endresultat waren Energieeinsparungen von ~40% bei der Kühlung. Beeindruckend!</p>
<p><em>In recent months, the Alphabet Inc. unit put a DeepMind AI system in control of parts of its data centers to reduce power consumption by manipulating computer servers and related equipment like cooling systems. […</em> <em>The] software changes how equipment runs inside the data centers to get […] more efficient consumption of electricity.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It controls about 120 variables in the data centers. The fans and the cooling systems and so on, and windows and other things,&rdquo; Hassabis said. &ldquo;They were pretty astounded.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>[…] Now that DeepMind knows the approach works, it also knows where its AI system lacks information, so it may ask Google to put additional sensors into its data centers to let its software eke out even more efficiency.</em></p>

Davor leiden wir an schlimmen Krankheiten wie Krebs, Diabetes, Alzheimer und anderen. Aber was lässt uns eigentlich altern und warum werden wir kränker? Lässt sich beides nicht irgendwie stoppen?</em></p>
<p>Die von Dennis übersetzten Hintergrund sind sehr interessant, und auch der Rest der Site enthält viel Wissenswertes. Gute Sache, danke dafür!</p>
<p>Aber was macht diese Non-Profit-Organisation eigentlich?</p>
<p><em>[Die Arbeit der Foundation] erstreckt sich über wissenschaftliche Forschung und öffentliche Fürsprache für die Anwendung regenerativer Medizin, um Alterskrankheiten auszurotten, da nach Angaben der Weltgesundheitsorganisation jedes Jahr etwa 58 Millionen Menschen weltweit sterben; etwa 160.000 Personen pro Tag, von denen etwa 100.000 an altersbedingten Krankheiten sterben.</em></p>
<p>(Danke, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SENS_Foundation">Wikipedia</a>.) Ich bin seit langer Zeit regelmäßiger Förderer der Foundation, weil ich ihre Arbeit befürworte. <a href="http://www.sens.org/">Die SENS-Website</a> bietet sehr interessante Informationen zum Altern (vom 1990er-Jahre-Design lassen wir uns mal nicht stören).</p>

<p><em>There are really only two human enterprises: creation and implementation. We design things, come up with interesting strategies and ideas and then we execute them.

<p><em>Machines will be able to do almost everything far more cheaply than humans. Average incomes will drop, but so will the average cost of production, driving down the price of goods and services. This means that, even though unemployment will increase, the standards of living could actually rise, not fall. […]</em></p>
<p><em>Unlike the Industrial Revolution, which spanned centuries, the “automation revolution” could happen in as little as 15 years. The only real obstacle will be people’s willingness to embrace change.</em>[…]</p>

<p>Video, 2:27 min, kein Textinhalt.</p>
<p><em>SpotMini is a new smaller version of the Spot robot, weighing 55 lbs dripping wet (65 lbs if you include its arm.) SpotMini is all-electric (no hydraulics) and runs for about 90 minutes on a charge, depending on what it is doing. SpotMini is one of the quietest robots we have ever built. It has a variety of sensors, including depth cameras, a solid state gyro (IMU) and proprioception sensors in the limbs. These sensors help with navigation and mobile manipulation.

Sehr interessantes Konzept (verbindet sich mit einer Smartphone-App und nutzt dessen Rechenpower), das wie dafür gemacht scheint, Kinder (und Großeltern) an die Welt der Robotik heranzuführen.</p>
<p><em>While Cozmo sleeps, it snores. The small robot — shaped like a miniaturized bulldozer with a CRT monitor for a cockpit — sits in a charging dock, waiting to be awoken. Like Pixar’s adorably anthropomorphic WALL-E, Cozmo falls somewhere between a Mars rover and an animated woodland creature. It’s lifelike enough to evoke sympathy, but still enough of a toy not to teeter too close to the uncanny valley.</em></p>
<p><em>With the tap of a smartphone screen, Cozmo comes to life. It makes a subtle motion to indicate it’s shaking off its slumber and begins wheeling over to the edge of the table. When it gets too close, it slams to a halt and looks down over the cliff, emitting a series of terrified chirps. When it wheels back and reorients itself, Cozmo takes a hard look at the other faces in the room. Some are new, but others it remembers from before it fell asleep.</em></p>

<p>inform-software.de</p>
<p>Ein schon etwas älterer Artikel (vom November 2013), der allerdings nichts von seiner Aktualität verloren hat, im Gegenteil. Welche Auswirkungen haben neue Herstellungsverfahren auf &ldquo;alteingesessene&rdquo; Industrien wie z.B. die Transportbranche?</p>
<p><em>Einem Whitepaper des britischen Marktforschungsunternehmens Transport Intelligence zufolge, ist bei der Produktion von 30% aller Endprodukte an irgendeiner Stelle ein 3D-Drucker im Spiel gewesen. Für das Jahr 2020 wird erwartet, dass dieser Anteil auf 80% ansteigt. Neben der schnellen Bereitstellung von Prototypen wird die Technologie schon jetzt z.B. bei Zahnprothesen oder in der Luftfahrtindustrie für echte Bauteile eingesetzt. […]</em></p>
<p><em>Bedenkt man die Möglichkeiten, dann könnte das traditionelle Modell globaler Supply Chains schon bald ausgedient haben. Komplexe Prozesse mit riesigen Stücklisten, Massenlagerung von Endprodukten und lange Transportwege wären in einem Szenario, in dem der 3D-Druck das dominante Werkzeug zur Produktion und in diesem Zusammenhang Make-to-order der Normalfall wird, nicht mehr notwendig. Es wäre sogar denkbar, dass die Technologie zu sehr kurzen Supply Chains führt – wenn nämlich alles dort produziert wird, wo es auch verkauft wird.</em></p>

<p>technologyreview.com</p>
<p>Wo stehen wir im Bereich der Gentherapien? Ganz am Anfang, aber das MIT Tech Review zeigt in diesem sehr interessanten Beitrag anhand einer existierenden Therapie, welche <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A4mophilie">Hämophilie</a> dauerhaft stark lindern kann, was für Möglichkeiten da auf uns zukommen.</p>
<p><em>Gene therapy is booming, with about 70 products in late-stage testing. UniQure and Baxalta are both testing gene therapies for hemophilia B. And the drug company BioMarin is testing a genetic fix for hemophilia A, the more common type; it has reported results in eight patients, and Tuddenham calls them just as impressive as Spark’s.</em></p>
<p><em>Some scientists say it’s too soon to declare success, since patients’ factor levels are still short of normal. “I wouldn’t say they’ve found the cure but this is the first time it looks good,” says Federico Mingozzi, a gene-therapy scientist at France’s INSERM research institute. “The true innovation is that they have really had a consistent result. I haven’t seen that before.”</em></p>

<p>wired.de</p>
<p>Die UK-Gesundheitstechnologie-Firma Babylon hat eine Smartphone-App entwickelt, die auf eine künstliche Intelligenz zurückgreift, die medizinische Empfehlungen ausspricht — anhand der Symptome, die der Nutzer/Patient beschreibt. In einem umfangreicheren Test trat die App gegen ein Juniorarzt/Krankenschwester-Team an, um über 100 fiktive Fälle zu beurteilen.</p>
<p><em>Bei 102 fiktiven Patienten gab [die App] zu 100 Prozent Empfehlungen, die zu einem sicheren Ausgang führen würden. 92 Prozent der App-Empfehlungen wurden als „akkurat“ eingestuft, was der durch Top-Ärzte definierten Referenz-Empfehlung entsprach, wie Motherboard berichtet.</em></p>
<p><em>Krankenschwestern und Doktoren schnitten in den Tests ein wenig schlechter ab als die App: 97 Prozent der Fälle erhielten eine sichere Empfehlung, nur 73,5 Prozent der Krankenschwestern und 77,5 Prozent der Ärzte erteilten die Referenz-Empfehlung. Dr. Austin, die gegen Check antrat, sieht künstliche Intelligenz aber eher als Ergänzung statt als Bedrohung: KI wird die Medizin bereichern. Schon bald könnten so Hausärzte Entlastungen erfahren und Notaufnahmen bereits während der Wartezeit mit der Diagnostik beginnen, während sich die Ärzte noch um andere Patienten kümmern.</em></p>

<p>Die Meldung an sich ist schon ein knappes Jahr alt, aber ich wurde gerade erst darauf aufmerksam gemacht.  (Danke dafür, Leser <a href="https://twitter.com/ede_/status/745749932884254720">Eduard Anton</a>!)</p>
<p><em>Ein Roboter namens Hadrian aus Australien mauert ein Familienhaus in nur zwei Tagen. Bauarbeiter brauchen bis zu sechs Wochen. Die Firma Fastbricks Robotics will damit günstigere Häuser ermöglichen.</em></p>
<p><em>Auf den ersten Blick sieht Hadrian wie eine gewöhnliche Baumaschine aus. Ist er aber nicht. Der Roboter trumpft mit einem Können auf, das in der Baubranche recht einzigartig ist. Er verbaut 1000 Steine pro Stunde und mauert ein Haus in nur zwei Tagen. Selbst die besten Bauarbeiter schaffen in Wettbewerben höchstens 743 Steine. […]</em></p>
<p><em>Und so funktioniert Hadrian: Der Roboter greift auf 3D-Baupläne zu, die Konstrukteure in der sogenannten Computer-Aided-Design-Software (CAD) hinterlegen. Er lernt die Position jedes Ziegels kennen. Dann nimmt er sie nacheinander mit einer Greifhand auf, kürzt sie bei Bedarf, lässt Mörtel darauf fließen und legt sie an die richtige Stelle.</em></p>
<p>Hadrian wird kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt, und Fastbricks Robotics arbeitet an der Markteinführung bis Mitte 2017.</p>

<p>Tolle Zusammenfassung der zwei Phasen, die neue Technologien durchlaufen. In Phase #1 (die &ldquo;Installationsphase&rdquo;) tauchen die neuen Sachen im Markt auf, werden mehr oder weniger enthusiastisch ausprobiert von den jeweiligen Zielgruppen. Die Preise sind hoch, es besteht eine gewisse Unsicherheit, was man damit machen kann, und es wird diskutiert, ob es sinnvoll ist. In Phase #2 (der &ldquo;Einsatzphase&rdquo;) haben sich Zielgruppen gefunden, die verstehen, was die Vorteile und Nachteile sind, die Preise sind gefallen, und die Technologien krempeln den Alltag um.</p>
<p><em>At USV we have been using Carlota Perez’s framework that distinguishes between the installation and deployment phases of a technology. In short, the installation phase is when a technology first comes into a market and investments are capacity building. The deployment phase is when this capacity is used to actually affect broad changes in the economy and society. The installation phase is (almost) always marked by a speculative bubble. Perez documents this across many prior technologies such as railroads and telegraphs.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>We are right now in the installation phase in many different technologies all at once</strong>, including drones, self-driving vehicles, AR/VR, bio-informatics, CRISPR, crypto currencies, machine learning and I am probably forgetting some.</em></p>

<p>washingtonpost.com</p>
<p>An der Stanford University School of Medicine wurde eine Studie beendet, in der Patienten, die nach einem Schlaganfall schwere motorische Störungen aufwiesen, Stammzellen ins Hirn gespritzt wurden. Das führte zu einer überraschenden Regeneration der beschädigten Hirnregionen, mit teils atemberaubenden Folgen: die Leute konnten Gliedmaßen wieder bewegen, die durch den Schlaganfall lahmgelegt worden waren, in einem Fall konnte eine 71-jährige Frau nach mehreren Jahren ihren Rollstuhl verlassen und wieder selbständig gehen.</p>
<p><em>Stanford researchers studying the effect of stem cells injected directly into the brains of stroke patients said Thursday that they were &ldquo;stunned&rdquo; by the extent to which the experimental treatment restored motor function in some of the patients. While the research involved only 18 patients and was designed primarily to look at the safety of such a procedure and not its effectiveness, it is creating significant buzz in the neuroscience community because the results appear to contradict a core belief about brain damage — that it is permanent and irreversible. […]</em></p>
<p><em>Gary Steinberg, the study&rsquo;s lead author and chair of neurosurgery at Stanford, said in an interview that while he is cautious about &ldquo;overselling&rdquo; the results of such a small study, his team has been &ldquo;stunned&rdquo; that seven of the 18 patients experienced significant improvement in their abilities following treatment.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Their recovery was not just a minimal recovery like someone who couldn&rsquo;t move a thumb now being able to wiggle it. It was much more meaningful. One 71-year-old wheelchair-bound patient was walking again,&rdquo; said Steinberg, who personally performed most of the surgeries.</em></p>

<p><strong>Duschgedanke:</strong> China ist die Werkbank der Welt, ungefähr 25% aller Produkte weltweit kommen von dort. Wenn immer mehr Industrieroboter eingesetzt werden, und diese überall vergleichbare Kosten und vergleichbare Fähigkeiten besitzen, dann besteht demnächst™ für Firmen kein finanzieller Anreiz mehr, in Billiglohnländern zu produzieren. Ergo werden viele Produktionsstätten wieder in ihre &ldquo;Ursprungsländer&rdquo; umziehen. (Nur hängen an diesen Stätten dann sehr wahrscheinlich kaum noch Jobs.)</p>

<p>Wenn Roboter alltäglicher werden, müssen sie nicht nur praktisch sein, sondern auch gewisse menschliche Umgangsformen lernen. Startups und Forschung arbeiten auch daran!</p>
<p><em>If robots are going to take over the world, they could at least have the courtesy not to bump into us while they’re at it. That’s not as easy as it sounds, though, especially when a robot is trying to make its way through a bustling space like a mall, hospital, or crowded city street.</em></p>

<p><em>Um die digitale Revolution heute zu begreifen, lohnt ein Blick zurück: In der zweiten Hälfte des 18. Jahrhunderts beginnt das erste Maschinenzeitalter. Ganz zentral dabei: die Dampfmaschine. Mit der industriellen Revolution ist nicht nur der allmähliche Rückzug des Pferdes aus Verkehr, Landwirtschaft und Militär eingeläutet. Neben die Elektrifizierung und Motorisierung tritt die Mechanisierung - Muskelkraft wird auf breiter Front ersetzt. Der Mensch bleibt Kontrolleur und Steuermann.</em></p>

<p>Heute (5. Juni 2016) sind alle Schweizer Bürger dazu aufgerufen, über die Einführung eines bedingungslosen Grundeinkommen (BGE) abzustimmen. Ich persönlich drücke der <a href="http://www.grundeinkommen.ch/">Eidgenössischen Volksinitiative</a> die Daumen. In diesem Zusammenhang empfehle ich Euch besonders den letzten Link in dieser Ausgabe: ARTE&rsquo;s Yourope-Sendung <em>&ldquo;Gleiches Geld für alle: Braucht Europa das bedingungslose Grundeinkommen?&quot;</em> beschäftigt sich mit dem BGE im Allgemeinen und der Schweizer Initiative im Detail. Ein sehr interessantes und wichtiges Thema, das uns in Deutschland hoffentlich bald auch mehr beschäftigen wird.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Mensch, Carlo, Du lebst noch‽&quot;</em> Ja, ich bin selbst überrascht! Lange habe ich gegrübelt, in welche Richtung ich NadZ weiterführen will. Jetzt weiss ich es. Seid Ihr bereit? Okay:</p>
<p><strong>#1: Ich gehe ab sofort davon aus, dass Ihr (die tollsten Newsletter-Leser Deutschlands!) zumindest halbwegs gut Englisch sprecht.</strong> Ich schaffe es schlichtweg nicht mehr, englischsprachige Artikel in deutsch zusammenzufassen. Deswegen wird sich NadZ in Zukunft eher am Modell &ldquo;kuratierte Link-Sammlung&rdquo; orientieren: ich sammle die Artikel, die mich ansprechen, und bringe sie dann mit Link, kurzem Exzerpt und/oder ein bis zwei Sätzen auf Deutsch in den Newsletter.</p>
<p>**#2:**<strong>NadZ wird definitiv etwas mehr &ldquo;makro&rdquo;.</strong> Technologische Fortschritte sind super, aber was wir mit ihnen anstellen bzw. wie sie unsere Gesellschaft verändern können (und werden), das ist mindestens ebenso wichtig wie die technische Entwicklung an sich. Das wird sich in der Link-Auswahl widerspiegeln.</p>
<p><strong>#3:</strong> Neue Ausgaben erscheinen, wenn ich der Meinung bin, dass mal wieder genug Links zusammengekommen sind, und nicht mehr in einem festen Turnus — den ich selbst immer wieder breche und dann ein schlechtes Gewissen habe.</p>
<p><strong>#4: Neues Design, <a href="https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/">neue Website</a>!</strong></p>
<p>Das klingt jetzt vermutlich alles nach simplen Änderungen, aber die Fragen <em>&ldquo;Kann ich das machen? Ist das dann noch Neues aus der Zukunft?&quot;</em>, hat mich wirklich lange beschäftigt. Ich bin zu dem Schluss gekommen, dass die Antwort auf beide Fragen ein resolutes <em>&ldquo;Ja!&quot;</em> ist. So there. :)</p>

<p>Selbstfahrende bzw. fahrerlose LKW/PKW werden bald eine Menge Jobs überflüssig machen — darüber rede ich ja (gern) schon seit Jahren, denn da geht es eben nicht nur um die Fahrer.</p>
<p>Sicherere Fahrzeuge werden die Versicherungsbranche verändern. Sie werden effizienter fahren, und weniger Treibstoff verbrauchen, was Tankstellen betreffen wird. Weniger Verschleiss heisst weniger Verkäufe und Arbeit bei Herstellern, Zulieferern und Werkstätten. Fallende Unfallzahlen werden gewissen Ängste bei Abschleppunternehmen und Anwälten auslösen. Wo keine Fahrer sind, sind weniger Raststätten vonnöten. Brauchen wir dann noch so viele Parkplätze wie bisher, und wenn nein, was heisst das für die Parkplatzbetreiber? Und so weiter.</p>
<p>Automatisierung und Roboter werden viele Jobs wegzaubern. Daran führt kein Weg vorbei. Fürchten brauchen wir uns deswegen nicht, aber wir sollten uns auf diese Zeit vorbereiten.</p>

			 <p>My original <a href="http://www.withings.com/eu/en/products/activite-pop">Withings Activité Pop</a> silicone armband broke, and while I did want to class it up a mite with a replacement band, I really didn&rsquo;t want to spend $100+ on an original Withings leather armband.</p>
<p>So I went shopping around and in the end settled on a really nice, very affordable Hirsch<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> &ldquo;Forest&rdquo; leather band.  I paid ~€27 for the medium-sized variant in light/golden brown.  I spend about half and hour in the store, checking out different armbands, and while I don&rsquo;t like all of them (different looks, different tastes) they&rsquo;re all really nice quality!</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have the quick release spring bars, tho — which works for me because I don&rsquo;t plan on going swimming anytime soon, and there have been no issues during/after my usual Fitstar training sessions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the end result.</p>

<h2 id="roboter-bringen-sich-gegenseitig-neue-tricks-bei">Roboter bringen sich gegenseitig neue Tricks bei</h2>
<p>Baxter setzt Tassen ab. Quelle: Youtube, h2r Lab.</p>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1GLNL2J"><strong>Artikel im MIT Technology Review</strong></a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1GLNL2J">«gtü»</a> — Forscher weltweit arbeiten an Systemen, die Robotern erlauben, erlerntes Wissen untereinander auszutauschen. Ein solches System ist <a href="http://www.robobrain.me/">RoboBrain</a>.</p>
<p>Vor Kurzem hat ein Roboter (Name/Typ: Baxter) via Robobrain die Daten eines komplett anderen Roboters (Name/Typ: PR2) genutzt, um zu verstehen, wie man Tassen auf andere Objekte stellt. Das klingt in erster Linie nach einer sinnlosen Aufgabe, ist aber durchaus komplex, schliesslich musste PR2 von seinem menschlichen Trainer erst diverse Konzepte erlernen, um zum Ziel zu kommen: welches dieser Objekte ist eine Tasse, wohin soll die eigentlich, und warum fällt sie dauernd wieder von diesem anderen Ding herunter — und was ist <em>das Ding</em> überhaupt? Und so weiter.</p>
<p>Baxter übernahm dann schliesslich all dieses erlernte Wissen, und setzte es für sich selbst um, was bemerkenswert ist, schliesslich sind die zwei Maschinen durchaus unterschiedlich aufgebaut, simple Instruktionen können also nicht 1:1 übernommen werden.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Researchers at Cornell University previously devised an online game, called TellMeDave, through which volunteers can help train a robot to perform a task and associate different actions with commands given in everyday language. By guiding the robot through a task, a volunteer trains a machine-learning algorithm so the robot can perform the task again. And this learned behavior is stored in a central repository called RoboBrain that’s accessible by other robots […]</p>
<p>Some time ago, through this platform, a type of research robot called PR2 had been taught to perform a number of a simple demonstration tasks, including picking up several mugs from a table and placing them on top of upturned bowls. Several hundred miles away, in a lab at Brown University, a different type of robot, called Baxter, has taken what PR2 had learned and used it to figure out how to perform the same task in a different setting.</p>
<p>The work is part of an effort to figure out how robots might share information in useful ways. That could reduce the need for meticulous reprogramming, and it could allow robots to adapt to quickly when faced with a new task or an unfamiliar setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Das ist natürlich nur ein kleiner Schritt, aber trotzdem bedeutend für die Robotik, und kein Endziel in sich. Wissen weiterzugeben ist schliesslich eine wichtige Fähigkeit. Eltern lehren ihre Kinder, z.B. wie man mit Messer und Gabel isst, wie man sein Zimmer aufräumt, dass Giesskanne und Steckdose nicht zusammengehören oder dass ein Feuerzeug ziemlich ungeeignet für die Haarpflege ist. Dadurch muss der Nachwuchs nicht alles Wissen selbständig erlangen, es wird ihm zugetragen, was seine Entwicklung beschleunigt. Das ist in der Robotik nicht so viel anders.</p>
<p>Ich denke trotzdem, dass noch ein paar Jahre ins Land gehen werden, bis Robobrain eine eine eigene Kategorie für Erlerntes vom Typ “KILL HUMANS” hat. Hahaha. (Gott, Killer-Roboter-Witze sind so doof.)</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1PdZwAm"><strong>Artikel beim Singularity HUB</strong></a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1PdZwAm">«gtü»</a> — Forscher an der Stanford University (USA) haben in Versuchen mit ALS-Patienten <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> ein Hirn/Tablet-Interface entwickelt, das es einer vollständig gelähmten Locked-in-Patientin erlaubt, per sog. “Neuroprothese” ein Android-Tablet zu bedienen. Sie steuert das Tablet mit ihren Gedanken.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two years ago, patient T6 volunteered for the BrainGate clinical trials and had a 100-channel electrode array implanted into the left side of her brain in regions responsible for movement.</p>
<p>At the time, the Stanford subdivision was working on a prototype prosthetic device to help paralyzed patients type out words on a custom-designed keyboard by simply thinking about the words they want to spell.</p>
<p>The prototype worked like this: the implanted electrodes recorded her brain activity as she looked to a target letter on the screen, passed it on to the neuroprosthesis, which then interpreted the signals and translated them into continuous control of cursor movements and clicks. […]</p>
<p>The team’s breakthrough moment came when they realized their point-and-click cursor system was similar to finger tapping on a touchscreen, something most of us do everyday. […]</p>
<p><em>“Basically the tablet recognized the prosthetic as a wireless Bluetooth mouse,”</em> explained [Dr. Paul Nuyujukian, a neuroengineer and physician from Stanford University]. <em>“We pointed her to a web browser app and told her to have fun.”</em></p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1l1Ge6d"><strong>Artikel in Nature</strong></a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1l1Ge6d">«gtü»</a> — Die US-Regierungsbehörde FDA <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> hat einer viralen Therapie gegen Melanoma die Zulassung erteilt. Ein genetisch verändertes Herpesvirus darf jetzt von Kliniken bei der Behandlung von bestimmten Arten von Hautkrebs eingesetzt werden. Das Virus infiziert die Tumorzellen, was das Immunsystem veranlasst, diese Zellen zu bekämpfen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An engineered herpesvirus that provokes an immune response against cancer has become the first treatment of its kind to be approved for use in the United States, paving the way for a long-awaited class of therapies. On 27 October, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a genetically engineered virus called talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) to treat advanced melanoma. Four days earlier, advisers to the European Medicines Agency had endorsed the drug.</p>
<p>With dozens of ongoing clinical trials of similar ‘oncolytic’ viruses, researchers hope that the approval will generate the enthusiasm and cash needed to spur further development of the approach. <em>“The era of the oncolytic virus is probably here,”</em> says Stephen Russell, a cancer researcher and haematologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. <em>“I expect to see a great deal happening over the next few years.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Einen interessanten Artikel zur Meldung gibts auch bei <a href="http://zukun.tf/1RUI1nM">WIRED: <em>“The FDA Just Approved One Cancer-Killing Virus. Expect More”</em></a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1RUI1nM">«gtü»</a>. Und ich denke, WIRED hat vollkommen recht, wenn sie die Therapie oberflächlich betrachtet als wenig aufregend bezeichnen, denn die Behandlung ist teuer (~$65.000) und gibt dem Patienten durchschnittlich “nur” ein paar Monate mehr. Aber das “wie” ist durchaus entscheidend: hier geht es um ein gentechnisch verändertes Virus, das das menschliche Immunsystem auf Trab bringt.</p>
<p>Jede Wette, es wird nicht das Letzte sein.</p>

<p>Boeing Microlattice. Quelle: Boing.</p>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1QoQ2kf"><strong>Artikel der International Business Times</strong></a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1QoQ2kf">«gtü»</a> — Boing hat ein neues Mikrometallgitter-Material (“Microlattice”) vorgestellt, dass zu 99.9% aus Luft besteht. (Hauptsächlich besteht es aus winzigen querverbundenen hohlen Röhrchen, deren Wandungen ca. 1000⨉ dünner als ein menschliches Haar sind.) Das Material ist superleicht, immens schockabsorbierend und sehr flexibel.</p>
<p>Konkrete Anwendungsgebiete gibt es derzeit noch nicht, aber da Boing sowohl in der Aerospace- als auch in der Automobil-Industrie (als Zulieferer) tätig ist, habe ich so meine Vermutungen, wo das Material zum Einsatz kommen könnte. :)</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/k6N_4jGJADY">Das von Boing veröffentlichte Video (2:23 min)</a> ist auch ohne Englischkenntnisse sehenswert. Wem das zu lang dauert: <a href="http://zukun.tf/1Prwuxm">hier ist ein Bild, in dem ein Microlattice-Quader auf einer Pusteblume sitzt.</a></p>
<p>In einer Hackernews-Diskussion zum Thema kam die Frage auf, ob sich das Material rein theoretisch auch als “Füllung” für große Luftschiffe (Zeppeline o.Ä.) eignen würde — eventuell könnte man es in eine feste Hülle packen und die 99.9% Luft im Material durch Wasserstoff ersetzen? <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10373966">Ja, das würde funktionieren</a>: Luft wiegt unter Normbedingungen 1.293 kg/m3; das Gewicht einer Struktur aus 0.01% Aluminium (2700 kg/m3) und 99.99% Wasserstoff (0.09 kg/m3) dagegen beträgt pro Kubikmeter lediglich 0.36 kg. Da fehlen mir etwas die Worte.</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1JvoOUb"><strong>Artikel bei KurzweilAI</strong></a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1JvoOUb">«gtü»</a> — An der Washington University wurde ein haarfeines Gerät entwickelt, das im Kopf implantiert werden kann, um dort auf drahtlosen Befehl hin medizinische Wirkstoffe freizusetzen, die gezielt Sektionen des Hirns beeinflussen können.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A team of researchers has developed a tiny “wireless optofluidic neural probe” the width of a human hair that can be implanted in the brain and triggered by remote control to deliver drugs and activate targeted populations of brain cells.</p>
<p>The technology, demonstrated for the first time in mice, may one day be used to treat pain, depression, epilepsy, and other neurological disorders in people by targeting therapies to specific brain circuits with fewer side effects, according to the researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>
<p>The research builds on earlier work in optogenetics, a technology that makes individual brain cells sensitive to light and then activates those targeted populations of cells with flashes of light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Momentan funktioniert das nur in Versuchstieren, die Hoffnung ist aber, derartige Geräte eines Tages für Menschen verfügbar zu machen, und das nicht nur im Hirn, sondern überall dort, wo sie gebraucht werden — z.B. als Regulator an inneren Organen, die von chronischen Entzündungen geplagt sind.</p>

<h2 id="algenproteine-gegen-blindheit">Algenproteine gegen Blindheit</h2>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1Mokz0C"><strong>Artikel bei Singularity HUB</strong></a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1Mokz0C">«gtü»</a> — Die US-Behörde FDA<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> hat der Firma RetroSense Therapeutics LLC die Erlaubnis erteilt, ihre (noch) experimentelle Gentherapie in klinischen Phase-I/II-Tests an 15 menschlichen Freiwilligen mit Retinopathia Pigmentosa (RP)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> zu erproben. Die Therapie soll es den Augen der Patienten, die an zunehmendem Verlust ihrer Sehfähigkeit bis hin zu völliger Blindheit leiden, ermöglichen, neue Photorezeptoren aufzubauen — und damit die geschädigten retinalen Zellen zu umgehen.</p>
<p>Anders formuliert: RetroSense Therapeutics ist mit seiner Gentherapie anscheinend auf einem guten Weg, ein paar Arten von Blindheit zu umgehen.</p>
<p>Das wissenschaftliche Feld, um das es hier geht, nennt sich Optogenetik — die Steuerung von genetisch modifizierten Zellen durch Licht. Vor ein paar Jahren kam die Forschung auf die Idee, sog. “Transportproteine” zu nutzen, die in grünen Algen vorkommen. Diese Proteine docken sich an Zellen an und öffnen diese, wenn sie mit Licht in Berührung kommen. Durch diese Öffnung gelangen Ionen in die Zellen, und dann … <em>passiert Wissenschaft!</em> Je nach Zelltyp geschehen unterschiedliche Dinge; die Auswirkung bei den Zelltypen in der Retina, die nicht durch RP zerstört werden, ist die Entwicklung einer Licht-Wahrnehmung und die Weitergabe dieser sensorischen Signale ans Hirn. Die Sehfähigkeit wird (teilweise) neu hergestellt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It sounds completely crazy: as early as next year, using gene therapy scientists hope to restore sight in the blind by giving their eyes additional “light sensors.” […]</p>
<p>In many eye disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa or macular degeneration, the rods and cones gradually die off. This leads to progressively failing vision, and — without a cure — eventually turns one out of four sufferers legally blind.</p>
<p>These are cold, brutal diseases, but there is one silver lining: they leave ganglion and bipolar cells intact and still able to still communicate with the brain. […]</p>
<p>In 2006, Dr. Zhou Hua Pan, a researcher at Wayne State University, decided to stick the protein [channelrhodopsin-2] into mice that were genetically engineered for photoreceptor degeneration. It worked on the first try; in less than three months after a single treatment, the mice passed every vision test the scientists could throw at them.</p>
<p><em>“It worked perfectly, even in the very beginning,”</em> Pan told Wired. <em>“That was basically just really, really lucky.”</em></p>
<p>Pan’s success did not escape the notice of the biotech industry. In 2009, RetroSense Therapeutics […] leased the eye-wiring tech from Pan in a bid to bring it to human trials.</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1LwSHZM"><strong>Meldunge des SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</strong></a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1LwSHZM">«gtü»</a> — Das Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in den USA hat eine neue “Elektronen-Kamera” entwickelt, mit der Aufnahmen von einzelnen Atomen in Bewegung gemacht wurden, während diese “Knitter” in einem Material erzeugten, das lediglich drei Atome dick war (sog. Monolagen <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>) — und das in nur einer Trillionstel-Sekunde. Die erwähnte Bewegung wurde durch einen Laser erzeugt.</p>
<p>Jetzt einfach mal kurz innehalten und über diese letzte zwei Sätze nachdenken.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SLAC’s Ultrafast ‘Electron Camera’ Visualizes Ripples in 2-D Material</p>
<p>New research led by scientists from the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University shows how individual atoms move in trillionths of a second to form wrinkles on a three-atom-thick material. Revealed by a brand new “electron camera,” one of the world’s speediest, this unprecedented level of detail could guide researchers in the development of efficient solar cells, fast and flexible electronics and high-performance chemical catalysts.</p>
<p>The breakthrough […] could take materials science to a whole new level. It was made possible with SLAC’s instrument for ultrafast electron diffraction (UED), which uses energetic electrons to take snapshots of atoms and molecules on timescales as fast as 100 quadrillionths of a second. […]</p>
<p>SLAC Director Chi-Chang Kao said, <em>“Together with complementary data from SLAC’s X-ray laser Linac Coherent Light Source, UED creates unprecedented opportunities for ultrafast science in a broad range of disciplines, from materials science to chemistry to the biosciences.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dieses neue Instrument verspricht neue Möglichkeiten und Erkenntnisse in der sowie für die Entwicklung neuer Elektronik, Materialien, Solarzellen, Biotechnologie etc.</p>
<p><em>“Um zukünftige Technologien und Geräte entwickeln zu können und diese mit Licht zu steuern, um ihnen mittels systematischer Modifikationen neue Eigenschaften geben zu können, dazu müssen wir erst einmal die strukturellen Transformationen von Monolagen auf der atomaren Ebene verstehen”</em>, so der Stanford-Forscher Ehren Mannebach, der diese Studie leitet. Die neue Kamera ist ein absurd beeindruckender Schritt auf diesem Weg des Verstehens.</p>

<h2 id="roboter-auf-todesmission-am-great-barrier-reef">Roboter auf Todesmission am Great Barrier Reef</h2>
<p>Boulevardeske Headline: check!</p>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1PfZR3m"><strong>Artikel bei CNET</strong></a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1PfZR3m">«gtü»</a> — Am Great Barrier Reef vor der Küste Australiens geht seit Jahrzehnten die Korallen-Population zurück, teilweise alarmierend schnell. Das Reef stirbt. Einer der Gründe dafür ist der Dornenkronenseestern, der sich alle paar Jahre explosionsartig vermehrt und dann die Korallen wegmümmelt. Warum der Seestern sich so ungehemmt verbreitet, ist noch nicht zu 100% geklärt; Meeresbiologen vermuten, dass ein Auslöser dafür das industrielle Abfischen der natürlichen Fressfeinde des Seesterns ist.</p>
<p>Um dem Problem jetzt Herr zu werden, hat die Queensland University of Technology <a href="http://zukun.tf/1Pg2uT3">einen autonom arbeitenden Unterwasser-Roboter entwickelt</a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1Pg2uT3">«gtü»</a>, der selbständig das Reef patroulliert, selbständig Dornenkronenseesterne erkennt, und diesen selbständig eine Gallensäure-Injektion verpasst. Der Seestern stirbt dadurch, und steckt während seines Ablebens Artgenossen in seiner Umgebung an — ein tödlicher Domino-Effekt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Called the COTSbot (Crown-of-Thorns Starfish robot), it’s designed to autonomously patrol and monitor the reefs without a tether, using robotic vision to find the starfish. When it locates a Crown-of-Thorns starfish, it will administer a lethal injection of bile salts from a pneumatic arm.</p>
<p>This is not a pleasant death for the starfish. It breaks out in blisters that burst open, exposing the internal organs. This condition is infectious and can be passed to other Crown-of-Thorns starfish. Infected starfish die within 24 hours, with a 100 percent mortality rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Über die Ursachen für diese ganze Geschichte sollte man nicht zu sehr nachdenken; die Gruppen, die das Reef retten wollen, und die, die möglichst viele Fische aus dem Meer holen wollen, würden sich in einem Venn-Diagramm vermutlich nicht überschneiden. Ja, es ist deprimierend.</p>
<p>Aber der Fakt, dass die QUT auf einen solchen Roboter zurückgreift, der macht mich an. Ich glaube schon, dass solche Technologien uns bei vielen unserer <del>Probleme</del> Fuck-Ups helfen können.</p>

<li>direkte Kontrolle über eine mechanische Hand gegeben haben (via Direktverbindung zum Hirn)</li>
<li>sensorisches Feedback dieser Hand (Druckempfinden) zurück ins Hirn gesandt haben, und er es als das Tastgefühl seiner eigenen Hand wahrgenommen hat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Eine Prothese mit Tastsinn!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A 28-year-old who has been paralyzed for more than a decade as a result of a spinal cord injury has become the first person to be able to “feel” physical sensations through a prosthetic hand directly connected to his brain, and even identify which mechanical finger is being gently touched.</p>
<p>The advance, made possible by sophisticated neural technologies developed under DARPA’s Revolutionizing Prosthetics points to a future in which people living with paralyzed or missing limbs will not only be able to manipulate objects by sending signals from their brain to robotic devices, but also be able to sense precisely what those devices are touching. […]</p>
<p>The clinical work involved the placement of electrode arrays onto the paralyzed volunteer’s sensory cortex—the brain region responsible for identifying tactile sensations such as pressure. In addition, the team placed arrays on the volunteer’s motor cortex, the part of the brain that directs body movements.</p>
<p>Wires were run from the arrays on the motor cortex to a mechanical hand developed by the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) at Johns Hopkins University. That gave the volunteer—whose identity is being withheld to protect his privacy—the capacity to control the hand’s movements with his thoughts […]</p>
<p>Then, breaking new neurotechnological ground, the researchers went on to provide the volunteer a sense of touch. […] In the very first set of tests, in which researchers gently touched each of the prosthetic hand’s fingers while the volunteer was blindfolded, he was able to report with nearly 100 percent accuracy which mechanical finger was being touched. The feeling, he reported, was as if his own hand were being touched.</p>

<h2 id="truenorth-prozessor-neuer-ibm-chip-arbeitet-wie-ein-gehirn">TrueNorth-Prozessor: Neuer IBM-Chip arbeitet wie ein Gehirn</h2>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1UeH89J"><strong>Artikel in DIE WELT</strong></a> — IBM geht neue Wege und arbeitet seit 2008 an Chips, die komplett anders aufgebaut sind als die, die sich in jedem Mac, PC oder Smartphone befinden. Jeder dieser Chips mit dem Codenamen <em>TrueNorth</em> enthält 4096 Prozessorkerne und bildet 1 Million menschlichen Neuronen und 256 Millionen Synapsen nach. IBM stellte jetzt ein System vor, das aus einem Zusammenschluss von 48 dieser Chips besteht, und ziemlich beeindruckt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bei der Entwicklung eines von IBM als besonders schnell und stromsparend gepriesenen Computerchips, hat sich der IT-Konzern von Gehirnen inspirieren lassen. Die Chips besitzen Eigenschaften, die denen von Neuronen im Gehirn ähneln. Nun hat IBM 48 dieser Systeme zusammengeschaltet, was 48 Millionen künstliche Nervenzellen entspricht – vergleichbar mit dem Gehirn einer Ratte, berichtet <a href="http://zukun.tf/1UeHnlf">“Wired”</a>.</p>
<p>Herz dieser Systeme ist ein TrueNorth genannte Prozessor, an dem IBM seit Jahren arbeitet. Er sei der bisher größte von IBM in Bezug auf die verbauten Transistoren – trotzdem soll er weniger als 100 Milliwatt Strom verbrauchen.</p>
<p>Was den Chip aber vor allem besonders macht, ist seine Ähnlichkeit zum Aufbau von Gehirnen. Zum Beginn des Computerzeitalters hatte sich die sogenannte Von-Neumann-Architektur durchgesetzt – egal ob heutige PCs, Smartphones, Chips in Waschmaschinen oder Supercomputer – alle setzen auf Chips nach dieser Von-Neumann-Architektur. Und das seit Jahrzehnten.</p>
<p>Der neue IBM-Chip bricht mit diesem Computerparadigma und setzt stattdessen auf Strukturen, die von biologischen Gehirnen abgeschaut sind. Der Clou: Statt Rechenprozesse hintereinander abzuarbeiten, erlaubt diese Technologie parallele Berechnungen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zwar sind sowohl die Chips als auch <em>TrueNorth</em> an sich nur Prototypen, aber diese haben schon extrem gut in einem standardisierten Bilderkennungstest abgeschnitten, und das bei einem wahnsinnig niedrigen Stromverbrauch. Es ist eine echte neue Chip-Architektur, und so verkauft IBM das Konzept auch: <em>“eine neue Maschine für eine neue Ära”</em>.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Die Grundlagen der erwähnten Von-Neumann-Chip-Architektur<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> sind mittlerweile 70 Jahre alt.</p>

<h2 id="oneweb-airbus-baut-gigantische-internet-satelliten-konstellation">Oneweb: Airbus baut gigantische Internet-Satelliten-Konstellation</h2>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1O1hzan"><strong>Artikel bei Golem</strong></a> — Im Juni vermeldete das US-Unternehmen OneWeb Ltd., dass es 600 Kommunikationssatelliten ins All bringen wird, die die Erde flächendeckend mit Internet-Zugang überziehen sollen. Dazu hat OneWeb eine Investitionsrunde mit $500 Mio abgeschlossen, zu den Investoren gehören u.A. Airbus, Coca-Cola, Chiphersteller Qualcomm und die Virgin Group.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oneweb will Kommunikationssatelliten in die Erdumlaufbahn bringen, über die eine weltweite Datenkommunikation laufen soll. Die Konstellation soll zunächst aus 600 Satelliten bestehen, die Airbus bauen wird, wie die Unternehmen nun auf der Pariser Luftfahrtmesse ankündigten. 300 weitere Satelliten sollen als Ersatz für die vergleichsweise niedrig fliegenden Erdtrabanten gebaut werden. Oneweb hat neben Airbus einen weiteren Partner für das Projekt: Virgin Galactic, das Raumfahrtunternehmen von Richard Branson.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Schon 2017 könnten die ersten OneWeb-Satelliten mit einem Virgin-Gefährt ins All befördert werden, der offizielle Betrieb der Flotte ist für 2019 geplant.</p>
<p>Interessanterweise ist OneWeb nicht der einzige Spieler auf diesem Feld: auch SpaceX will in den nächsten Jahren ~4000 Satelliten in den Orbit bringen, um Zugang zum Netz überall auf der Erde zu ermöglichen. (Siehe Bloomberg Business: <a href="http://zukun.tf/1hMEDzS">“Elon Musk and SpaceX Plan a Space Internet”</a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1hMEDzS">«gtü»</a>.) SpaceX denkt da natürlich in etwas größeren Maßstäben. Das Unternehmen will mit dem Projekt nicht nur Geld verdienen — es dient auch als Testbett, um notwendiges Wissen für das Betreiben einer Satellitenkonstellation im Mars-Orbit zu sammeln. Schließlich ist es der Firma erklärtes Langzeit-Ziel, eine dauerhafte Kolonie auf unserem roten Nachbarplaneten zu etablieren. (Mehr zum sehr ergiebigen Thema “SpaceX und der Mars” gibts auch <a href="http://zukun.tf/1NYoCmn">im Teil “Zu guter Letzt…” dieser Ausgabe</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="wem-sollen-die-roboter-gehören">Wem sollen die Roboter gehören?</h2>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1JyA7uD"><strong>Artikel bei MIT Technology Review</strong></a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1JyA7uD">«gtü»</a> — Der MIT Tech Review-Redakteur David Rotman denkt über die sich ändernde Arbeitslandschaft nach: <em>“Who Will Own the Robots?”</em>. Seiner Meinung nach ist ein bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen nicht die einzige Möglichkeit, den nicht aufzuhaltenden Bruch des alten Systems “Geld für Arbeitsleistung” abzufangen; u.U. ist der verteilte Besitz der neuen Arbeitsmittel (Roboter, Technologie, Systeme) eine bessere Idee.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re in the midst of a jobs crisis, and rapid advances in AI and other technologies may be one culprit. How can we get better at sharing the wealth that technology creates?</p>
<p><em>“More and more computer-guided automation is creeping into everything from manufacturing to decision making,”</em> says [engineering Professor Hod Lipson at Columbia University]. In the last two years alone, he says, the development of so-called deep learning has triggered a revolution in artificial intelligence, and 3-D printing has begun to change industrial production processes. <em>“For a long time the common understanding was that technology was destroying jobs but also creating new and better ones,”</em> says Lipson. <em>“Now the evidence is that technology is destroying jobs and indeed creating new and better ones but also fewer ones. It is something we as technologists need to start thinking about.”</em> […]</p>
<p>Whoever owns the capital will benefit as robots and AI inevitably replace many jobs. If the rewards of new technologies go largely to the very richest, as has been the trend in recent decades, then dystopian visions could become reality. But the machines are tools, and if their ownership is more widely shared, the majority of people could use them to boost their productivity and increase both their earnings and their leisure. If that happens, an increasingly wealthy society could restore the middle-class dream that has long driven technological ambition and economic growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, das ist jetzt nicht unbedingt das übliche <em>“Hurra Zukunft”</em>-Material, das Ihr von mir gewohnt seid, aber das Thema treibt mich um; es ist nicht <em>“Hurra”</em>, aber sehr wohl <em>“Zukunft”</em>. Und damit meine ich die nächsten 10-20 Jahre!</p>
<p>Das aktuell vorherrschende Wirtschaftssystem der Welt basiert auf einem Kreislauf: ich stelle meine Arbeitsleistung einem Unternehmen zur Verfügung, das irgendetwas produziert, und werde dafür vergütet. Dieses Geld gebe ich zurück in den Markt, wenn ich Nahrung, Notwendiges und Dinge kaufe. Dieses Geld geht an Unternehmen, die wiederum stellen Arbeitsplätze zur Verfügung, der Kreislauf beginnt von vorn. <strong>Die westliche Gesellschaft ist klar auf diesen Kreislauf geeicht — der Wert eines Menschen wird daher häufig an seiner Arbeitsleistung, an seinem “Beitrag zur Volkswirtschaft” festgemacht.</strong> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Das ist seit sehr langer Zeit so. Über die Jahrzehnte/Jahrhunderte wurde die für diese Arbeiten benutzte Technologie immer besser, manche Arbeitsfelder fielen dadurch weg, dafür bildeten sich neue.</p>
<p>Jetzt allerdings sind wir an der Schwelle eines Zeitalters der Automatisierung. Mehr und mehr Jobs verschwinden aufgrund von Robotern, Fortschritten in künstlicher Intelligenz, neuen Materialien usw. Nur: neue Jobs bilden sich nicht mehr so viele. Das stellt die Gesellschaft vor ein gänzlich neues Problem:</p>
<p>Wenn es Jobs nur noch für einen kleinen Teil der Bevölkerung gibt, weil der Rest der Produktion etc. einer auf Hochleistung laufenden Industrie von Maschinen erledigt wird (Roboter, Software, selbstfahrende Automobile etc.), wenn also die große Mehrheit der Bürger gar keine Chance mehr hat, ihre Arbeitsleistung zu Geld zu machen und sie so keinen “Beitrag zur Volkswirtschaft” mehr leisten <em>kann</em>, was dann?</p>
<p>Die Antwort darauf ist: Die Gesellschaft muss sich wandeln, der “Wert” eines Menschen muss zwangsläufig von seiner Arbeitsleistung entkoppelt werden. Wenn der oben beschriebene Kreislauf zumindest halbwegs weiterlaufen soll, brauchen wir ein neues Modell, das allen Bürgern eine Teilhabe bietet. Ob das nun ein bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen ist, eine kluge Antwort auf die Frage <em>“Wem sollen die Roboter gehören?”</em> oder aber etwas völlig Anderes — das sollte diskutiert werden.</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1DVxGWH"><strong>Artikel bei Re/code</strong></a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1DVxGWH">«gtü»</a> — Der chinesische Web-/Technologiekonzern Baidu hat einen neuen Dienst namens “AskADoctor” gestartet (zu deutsch “Frag Einen Doktor”).</p>
<p>Fühlt man sich unwohl, kann man seine Symptome in die AskADoctor-App sprechen oder tippen. Die App gibt dann eine automatisierte “Diagnose-Vermutung” aus, und verbindet den Nutzer mit einem entsprechenden Arzt in der Nähe. AskADoctor ist auf den chinesischen Markt ausgerichtet; der Plan der Entwickler sieht vor, in Zukunft auch die offiziellen elektronischen Patientenakten zu integrieren, um bessere Vorab-Diagnosen stellen zu können.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A voice translation app akin to WebMD. Users rattle off a list of symptoms, such as achy joints, red eyes and a cough, and the Chinese search giant sends an immediate diagnostic suggestion (flu, 75 percent odds). Then it links users to a nearby medical specialist.</p>
<p>A majority of Chinese online turn to the Web first for health information, and voice search is far less cumbersome than text, Wei [Fan, a researcher for Baidu in Sunnyvale, Calif.,] said. […]</p>
<p>With AskADoctor, the computer voice translation couples with another deep-learning model that ropes in the health data owned and scraped by Baidu across the Chinese Web. Wei said the product can assess 520 different diseases, representing upward of 90 percent of the most common medical problems nationwide.</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1ITF2qB"><strong>Artikel bei WIRED</strong></a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1ITF2qB">«gtü»</a> — Mercedes-Benz arbeitet (wie viele andere Hersteller auch) an selbstfahrenden Trucks. Vor Kurzem erhielt der Konzern vom US-Bundesstaat Nevada eine Lizenz, um seine neuen, teilweise selbstfahrenden “Inspiration”-Trucks auf öffentlichen Straßen zu testen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Freightliner Inspiration offers a rather limited version of autonomy: It will take control only on the highway, maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles and staying in its lane. It won’t pass slower vehicles on its own. If the truck encounters a situation it can’t confidently handle, like heavy snow that covers lane lines, it will alert the human that it’s time for him to take over, via beeps and icons in the dashboard. If the driver doesn’t respond within about five seconds, the truck will slow down gradually, then stop.</p>
<p>In hardware terms, the truck isn’t much different from the latest trucks and passenger cars Daimler is putting on the road. A stereoscopic camera reads lane lines. Short and long range radar scan the road up to 800 feet ahead for obstacles. No sensors face backward, because they’re not needed. There’s no vehicle-to-vehicle communication, no LIDaR. The software algorithms are adjusted versions of those developed for use in Mercedes-Benz’s autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>The Freightliner is still very much a test vehicle. Daimler’s confident it’s safe for public roads, and the Nevada DMV agrees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Es wird allerdings noch Jahre dauern, bis der Inspiration-LKW kommerziell verfügbar ist, wenn er überhaupt in der Form auf den Markt kommt. Sowohl in den einzelnen Ländern als auch auf internationaler Ebene fehlt es immer noch an gesetzlichen Regelungen und Grundlagen für den Einsatz selbstständig steuernder Fahrzeuge.</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1DMn0Kg"><strong>Artikel im MIT Technology Review</strong></a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1DMn0Kg">«gtü»</a> - Facebook, Google, Apple und viele andere Firmen und Labore arbeiten an künstlicher Intelligenz, die natürliche Sprache versteht und bei ihrer Nutzung lernt, um bessere Antworten geben zu können. Die meisten Systeme (wie Apple’s Siri oder Google Now) haben ein recht kurzes Gedächtnis; sie merken sich nicht, was vorher gesprochen wurde, und stellen keine Verbindungen zu den zuvor gemachten Fragen her.</p>
<p>Wenn ich einer Person sequentielle Fragen stelle, z.B. <em>“Gibts hier italienische Restaurants in der Nähe?”</em> und danach <em>“Welches davon ist empfehlenswert?”</em>, dann ist meinem Gegenüber klar, dass sich die zweite Frage auf die erste bezieht. Für einen Computer dagegen ist das noch eine riesige Hürde. Und das ist nur eine Facette der sprachlichen Verständigung. Einen guten Einblick in die Arbeit eines der führenden Köpfe dieses Forschungszweiges, Yann LeCun, bietet das Feature beim Tech Review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LeCun’s group is working on going further. <em>“Language in itself is not that complicated,”</em> he says. <em>“What’s complicated is having a deep understanding of language and the world that gives you common sense. That’s what we’re really interested in building into machines.”</em> LeCun means common sense as Aristotle used the term: the ability to understand basic physical reality. He wants a computer to grasp that the sentence “Yann picked up the bottle and walked out of the room” means the bottle left with him. Facebook’s researchers have invented a deep-learning system called a memory network that displays what may be the early stirrings of common sense.</p>
<p>A memory network is a neural network with a memory bank bolted on to store facts it has learned so they don’t get washed away every time it takes in fresh data. The Facebook AI lab has created versions that can answer simple common-sense questions about text they have never seen before. For example, when researchers gave a memory network a very simplified summary of the plot of <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, it could answer questions such as “Where is the ring?” and “Where was Frodo before Mount Doom?” It could interpret the simple world described in the text despite having never previously encountered many of the names or objects, such as “Frodo” or “ring.”</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1gTbgL4"><strong>Artikel beim MIT Technology Review</strong></a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1gTbgL4">«gtü»</a> — Dass Organtransplantationen bei Menschen nicht unproblematisch oder immer möglich sind, ist bekannt. Wenn Spender und Empfänger z.B. nicht die gleiche Blutgruppe haben, kann keine Transplantation stattfinden, da der Körper des Empfängers das Organ nicht akzeptieren, sondern es wie einen Eindringling bekämpfen würde.</p>
<p>Doch was, wenn man die Organe von Tieren verpflanzen könnte? Das klingt noch unwahrscheinlicher, aber genau daran wird gearbeitet. Durch genetische Manipulation verändern Forscher ein wenig das Erbmaterial von Labor-Schweinen, so dass sie Organe produzieren, die einem Empfänger angepasst sind, der kein Schwein ist. Das nennt sich dann “Xenotransplantation”, also eine Transplantation über Speziesgrenzen hinweg. Vor ein paar Tagen wurden große Fortschritte auf diesem Feld bekannt: einem Pavian wurde ein Schweineherz verpflanzt, und dieses schlug für 945 Tage, ein anderer Pavian erhielt ebensolche Spendernieren, die mehr als 4 Monate durchhielten.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the financial aid of a biotechnology executive whose daughter may need a lung transplant, U.S. researchers have been shattering records in xenotransplantation, or between-species organ transplants.</p>
<p>The researchers say they have kept a pig heart alive in a baboon for 945 days and also reported the longest-ever kidney swap between these species, lasting 136 days. The experiments used organs from pigs “humanized” with the addition of as many as five human genes, a strategy designed to stop organ rejection. […]</p>
<p><em>“We are adding the human genes to the pig so you have the organ repressing the immune response, rather than have to give a whopping dose of immune suppressants,”</em> says Ayares. By next year, some of the pigs will have as many as eight added human genes. These genetic changes make their organs more compatible with a human body, but the animals still look and act like normal pigs.</p>

<p>Another benefit of the process, says Aprecia, the drug’s maker, is that it allows a high drug load — up to 1,000 mg — to be delivered in a single dose. The 3-D printing process creates a pill that has <em>“a porous formulation that rapidly disintegrates with a sip of liquid,”</em> the company says.</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1Snk5hj"><strong>Meldung der UC San Francisco</strong></a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1Snk5hj">⟨gtü⟩</a> — In den letzten 20 Monaten ist in der Gentechnik viel passiert. Seit die Wissenschaftlerinnen Prof. Doudna und Prof. Charpentier im November 2013 der Fachwelt ihre CRISPR/Cas9-Methode zum genauen Bearbeiten von DNA präsentierten (siehe Ausgabe #8, <a href="http://zukun.tf/1gBvRnz"><em>“Durchbruch in der Gentechnik”</em></a>), hat diese schon einige vielversprechende Projekte ermöglicht.</p>
<p>Eines davon hat jetzt einen beachtlichen Erfolg vermeldet. An der University of California wurde eine neue Methode entwickelt, um auf präzise Weise die der Immunabwehr dienenden T-Lymphozyten<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> zu modifizieren, so dass diese z.B. eine Art Immunität gegenüber HIV aufbauen oder Tumore angreifen können.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a project spearheaded by investigators at UC San Francisco, scientists have devised a new strategy to precisely modify human T cells using the genome-editing system known as CRISPR/Cas9. Because these immune-system cells play important roles in a wide range of diseases, from diabetes to AIDS to cancer, the achievement provides a versatile new tool for research on T cell function, as well as a path toward CRISPR/Cas9-based therapies for many serious health problems.</p>
<p>Using their novel approach, the scientists were able to disable a protein on the T cell surface called CXCR4, which can be exploited by HIV when the virus infects T cells and causes AIDS. The group also successfully shut down PD-1, a protein that has attracted intense interest in the burgeoning field of cancer immunotherapy, as scientists have shown that using drugs to block PD-1 coaxes T cells to attack tumors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Das Beeindruckende an der Meldung ist jetzt nicht das Versprechen von HIV-Immunität — derlei Studien sind teilweise schon <a href="http://zukun.tf/1UgowrQ">in klinischen Tests angekommen</a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1UgowrQ">⟨gtü⟩</a> —, sondern die Möglichkeit des <em>präzisen</em> Editierens der T-Zellen.

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1GZ0Y1i"><strong>Artikel bei The Guardian</strong></a> <a href="http://gt.zukun.tf/1GZ0Y1i">⟨gtü⟩</a> — Biotechniker vom Howard Hughes Medical Institute (Maryland, USA) haben einen Labor-Test namens “VirScan” entwickelt, der anhand nur eines einzigen Tropfen Blutes eine Liste aller viraler Infektionen erstellen kann, die der Patient derzeit hat oder in der Vergangenheit hatte.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Researchers have developed a cheap and rapid test that reveals a person’s full history of viral infections from a single drop of blood.</p>
<p>The test allows doctors to read out a list of the viruses that have infected, or continue to infect, patients even when they have not caused any obvious symptoms.</p>
<p>The technology means that [general practitioners] could screen patients for all of the viruses capable of infecting people. It could transform the detection of serious infections such as hepatitis C and HIV, which people can carry for years without knowing.</p>
<p><em>“Normally, when a doctor wants to know if someone’s been infected with a virus, they have to guess what the virus is, and then look specifically for that virus,”</em> said Stephen Elledge, who led the project at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.</p>
<p><em>“This could lead to a diagnostic where people go annually to their doctor and get their viral history recorded. It could certainly discover viral infections that are serious and that a patient didn’t know they had,”</em> he said.</p>

<p>Die Kosten pro Test belaufen sich auf lediglich ~$25. VirScan ist zur Zeit aber leider nur in der Forschung im Einsatz und noch nicht kommerziell verfügbar.</p>

Now, he and a team of scientists at UCLA have developed a treatment procedure that could perhaps change the lives of paraplegics.</p>
<p>After four weeks of noninvasive electrical spinal cord stimulation, five men who are completely paralyzed in their lower body were able to move their legs again after years of immobility. […]</p>
<p><em>”[…] Surprisingly, by the end of the study … the men were able to move their legs with no stimulation at all.”</em></p>

<p>Zu diesem Wurm und seinen regenerativen Fähigkeiten gibt es viele Studien, Testreihen, dokumentierte Experimente. Die so zusammengetragenen Datenmengen sind sehr umfangreich. Die Tufts-Forscher fütterten jetzt einen lernenenden Algorithmus mit diesen Daten, um zu erreichen, dass seine Simulationen und Voraussagungen mit den in der Vergangenheit im Labor geschehenen Beobachtungen übereinstimmten, was ihnen auch gelang. Sie können nun einen solchen <em>Planaria</em>-Wurm also bis auf die Zellebene herab simulieren, und am Rechner mit großer Zuverlässigkeit berechnen, welche Veränderungen am Wurm welche Auswirkungen haben werden! Das dürfte die weitere Forschung durchaus beschleunigen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An artificial intelligence system has for the first time reverse-engineered the regeneration mechanism of planaria — the small worms whose extraordinary power to regrow body parts has made them a research model in human regenerative medicine.</p>
<p>The discovery by Tufts University biologists presents the first model of regeneration discovered by a non-human intelligence and the first comprehensive model of planarian regeneration, which had eluded human scientists for more than 100 years. […]</p>
<p>The algorithm generated networks by randomly combining previous networks and performing random changes, additions and deletions. Each candidate network was tested in a virtual worm, under simulated experiments. The algorithm compared the resulting shape from the simulation with real published data in the database. […]</p>
<p><em>“One of the most remarkable aspects of the project was that the model it found was not a hopelessly-tangled network that no human could actually understand, but a reasonably simple model that people can readily comprehend. All this suggests to me that artificial intelligence can help with every aspect of science, not only data mining, but also inference of meaning of the data.”</em></p>

<p><em>“T-Lymphozyten oder kurz T-Zellen bilden eine Gruppe von weißen Blutzellen, die der Immunabwehr dient. T-Lymphozyten stellen gemeinsam mit den B-Lymphozyten die erworbene (adaptive) Immunantwort. Das T im Namen steht für den Thymus, in dem die Zellen ausreifen. Wie alle Blutzellen werden T-Zellen im Knochenmark erzeugt. Von dort wandern sie in den Thymus, wo MHC-Rezeptoren auf ihrer Oberfläche ausgebildet werden. Durch eine negative Selektion werden all diejenigen ausgemustert, die auf körpereigene Proteine reagieren. Die restlichen, übrig gebliebenen T-Zellen können dann nur körperfremde Antigene erkennen und bekämpfen den Körper dadurch nicht selbst.”</em> Danke, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Lymphozyt">Wikipedia</a>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<h2 id="a-temporary-tattoo-that-senses-through-your-skin">A Temporary Tattoo That Senses Through Your Skin</h2>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1LfII9T"><strong>Artikel bei IEEE Spectrum</strong></a> — Flexible Biosensoren, die z.B. Blutdruck messen oder Körperchemikalien in Schweiss anzeigen oder die UV-Belastung der Haut anzeigen können. Hauchdünn, kleben auf der Haut, kommunizieren drahtlos mit Smartphone oder medizinischen Geräten, und lassen sich nach ein paar Tagen wie Pflaster abziehen. Diese “Biostamps” klingen nach Science Fiction, aber wenn sie das wären, würde ich hier nicht darüber schreiben, oder? ;)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think about your last medical exam. Your doctor checked your pulse, your temperature, your blood pressure, and maybe your blood oxygen. If any anomalies showed up, you may have been sent for further tests—perhaps an electrocardiogram for your heart, a blood test to check for diabetes, electromyography if you were having muscle weakness, or possibly even a polysomnogram at a sleep lab to check for apnea. All of these tests require specialized and costly equipment, trained medical technicians, or invasive pokes.</p>
<p>These tests—and more—could be accomplished by means of sensors so light, durable, and comfortable that you could wear them on your body for weeks at a time. It’s no distant dream: At press time, several sensors developed by members of Rogers’s research team had entered or were about to enter clinical trials in the United States and Europe, and the first commercial versions were expected to become available by the end of this year.</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1TR0aoj"><strong>Artikel beim Guardian</strong></a> — Ein internationales Team von Forschern des Paul-Drude-Instituts für Festkörperelektronik, der Freien Universität Berlin, den japanischen NTT Basic Research Laboratories und des US Naval Research Laboratory haben den kleinsten Transistor der Welt erstellt: <strong>er ist genau 1 Molekül groß</strong>, und damit über 40x kleiner als die neulich von IBM vorgestellten Transistoren (die definitiv <em>state of the art</em> sind).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists have created a transistor made up of a single molecule. Surrounded by just 12 atoms, it is likely to be the smallest possible size for a transistor – and the hard limit for Moore’s law.</p>
<p>The transistor is made of a single molecule of phthalocyanine surrounded by ring of 12 positively charged indium atoms placed on an indium arsenide crystal, as revealed in the scientific journal Nature Physics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Der Molekül-Transistor ist im Augenblick noch ein Labor-Projekt, hat aber mit Sicherheit große Auswirkungen auf das noch in den Kinderschuhen befindliche Feld der Quantum-Computer.</p>

<h2 id="mini-3d-printed-organs-beating-just-like-hearts">Mini 3D Printed Organs, Beating Just Like Hearts</h2>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1RzJu75"><strong>Artikel bei Singularity HUB</strong></a> — Am Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center’s Institute for Regenerative Medicine <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> in den USA werden sog. Organoide entwickelt, also Mini-Versionen von Organen wie Herz oder Leber. Diese Organoide <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> begannen als Hautzellen, die im Labor zu <a href="http://zukun.tf/1Hy54yJ">induzierten pluripotenten Stammzellen</a> umgewandelt wurden.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s something almost alchemical going on at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. Scientists there have genetically transformed skin cells into heart cells and used them to 3D print mini-organs that beat just like your heart. Another darker organoid fused to a mini-heart mimics your liver.</p>
<p>The work […] aims to simulate bodily systems by microfluidically linking up miniature organs—hearts, livers, blood vessels, and lungs—and testing new drug treatments and chemicals or studying the effects of viruses on them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bei Youtube gibts <a href="https://youtu.be/SfxCJji_RHo">ein kurzes Video solcher “Organoiden”</a> (1:01 min).</p>
<p>Und wer jetzt gern ein aktuelles Beispiel für die Nützlichkeit dieser Dinger hätte, sollte beim MIT Technology Review vorbeischauen: <a href="http://zukun.tf/1Gspp6V">“Brainlike Structures Made from Stem Cells Shed Light on Autism”</a>.</p>

<h2 id="scientists-demonstrate-animal-mind-melds">Scientists Demonstrate Animal Mind-Melds</h2>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1D9wIQW"><strong>Artikel in der The New York Times</strong></a> — Wissenschaftler in den USA haben in eine Methode entwickelt, die Gehirne mehrerer Tiere miteinander zu synchronisieren. Sie trainierten die Tiere daraufhin, und liessen sie Aufgaben zu lösen, die zu komplex für jeweils ein einzelnes Tier wären. In unterschiedlichen Experimentenreihen zeigten sie anhand von Affen und Ratten, dass es möglich ist, Hirne in Netzwerken anzuordnen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a pair of studies published on Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports, the researchers report that rats and monkeys can coordinate their brains to carry out such tasks as moving a simulated arm or recognizing simple patterns. In many of the trials, the networked animals performed better than individuals. […]</p>
<p>The rats learned how to produce synchronized brain activity in response to one of the signals, and unsynchronized activity in the other. Their collective response was correct as often as 87 percent of the time — substantially better than an individual rat learning on its own.</p>
<p>The scientists also found that the brains of three rats could be linked into an information-processing chain. First, they trained one rat to produce the correct kind of brain activity to two different electrical bursts in the brain. Then they linked the first rat’s brain signals to the brain of a second rat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Im Augenblick ist die Technologie noch invasiv, aber die Forscher denken, dass sie in Verbindung mit sog. “EEG-Tattoos” (siehe <a href="http://zukun.tf/1D9wk4X">IEEE Spectrum, “A Brain-Computer Interface That Lasts for Weeks”</a>) große Anwendungsmöglichkeiten in der Zukunft hat.</p>

<h2 id="discover-the-chemical-composition-of-everyday-stuff-with-a-smartphone-camera">Discover the Chemical Composition of Everyday Stuff… With a Smartphone Camera</h2>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1IckMWb"><strong>Artikel bei Singularity HUB</strong></a> — Spezialisten an der Tel Aviv University haben eine Smartphone-Kamera mit passender Software entwickelt, die hyperspektrale Bilder<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> aufnehmen und auswerten kann. Anhand der so gewonnenen spektralen Signaturen lässt sich der chemische Aufbau des fotografierten Objekts bestimmen — aus der Entfernung.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] the technology is an intimate combination of innovative hardware and software. The former, a microelectromechanical (MEMS) optical component, is mass producible and compatible with existing smartphone cameras.</p>
<p>The component is a kind of miniature filter that would allow smartphone cameras to take hyperspectral images that record the spectrum of light present in every pixel of the image. Software then creates a spectral map and compares it to a database of spectral “fingerprints” associated with substances. […]</p>
<p>The result? Point a handheld computing device at an object and learn its composition. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Die Firma <a href="http://zukun.tf/1OfXkFH">Unispectral</a>, die aus dem Projekt hervorgegangen ist, hat Backing aus der Industrie, die Chance, dass wir die Technologie in ein paar Jahren tatsächlich auf dem Consumer-Markt sehen, ist daher meiner Meinung nach recht hoch. Ob jetzt jeder Mensch ein Smartphone-Spektrometer benötigt, sei natürlich dahingestellt. ;) Aber die generelle Entwicklung ist bedeutsam: Sensoren werden mit zunehmender Geschwindigkeit immer kleiner, immer billiger. Das eröffnet neue Kombinationen und immer mehr Möglichkeiten.</p>

<h2 id="medical-microbots-take-a-fantastic-voyage-into-reality">Medical Microbots Take a Fantastic Voyage Into Reality</h2>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1CLO37Q"><strong>Artikel bei IEEE Spectrum</strong></a> — Roboter kommen nicht zwangsläufig mit Lasern am Kopf, Flammenwerfern und Job-Akquise-Absichten daher, sondern sind manchmal auch einfach nur winzig klein und helfen Ärzten, das Innere des menschlichen Körpers zu untersuchen. Zum Beispiel in der Form von Pillen, die vorn rein und hinten wieder raus kommen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Medicine is already embracing miniaturization, and some technology now makes its way through the human body without any tether to the outside world. There are, for example, battery-powered gadgets about the size of a large vitamin pill that can snap images of the esophagus, intestine, and colon as they move along.</p>
<p>And in 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave Proteus Digital Health, headquartered in Redwood City, Calif., the green light to market a much smaller swallowable technology: a single-square-millimeter silicon circuit that can be embedded inside a pharmaceutical pill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andere Projekte haben Prototypen winziger “Greifer” entwickelt, die im Körper Biopsien vornehmen können.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, David Gracias and his colleagues have developed microgrippers—star-shaped devices that can measure less than 500 micrometers from tip to tip. The grippers can be made of materials that respond to environmental factors such as temperature, pH, and even enzymes. A temperature-sensitive gripper’s arms will close when exposed to the body’s heat. If placed well, the arms will close around tissue, performing a miniature biopsy.</p>
<p>Such grippers might provide a less invasive way to screen for colon cancer in patients who suffer from chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.</p>

			 <p>Donnerstagmorgen sind dafür da, um mit der Tasse Frühstückskaffee noch einmal dem <a href="http://zukun.tf/1HbKAfb">missglückten SpaceX-Launch</a> am vorletzten Sonntag zu gedenken. Was für ein Rückschlag. Aber dann denkst Du wieder daran, was SpaceX-CTO Elon Musk vor 7 Jahren <a href="http://zukun.tf/1HbLbxo">in einem Interview sagte</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Optimism, pessimism, fuck that; we’re going to make it happen. As God is my bloody witness, I’m hell-bent on making it work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Das sagte er nach den ersten drei SpaceX-Starts — die waren <em>alle</em> schiefgegangen. (Beim Vierten hat es dann geklappt.) So wird Science Fiction wahrgemacht. :)</p>

<p>PS: Wenn Euch <strong>Neues aus der Zukunft</strong> gefällt, empfehlt es bitte weiter, auf Facebook, Google+, Twitter, WhatsApp, im Bus, beim Bäcker, mit Edding auf Bahnhofstoiletten — völlig egal, aber erzählt Anderen davon! Mehr Leser == mehr Motivation für mich. Danke!</p>

<h2 id="femtosecond-lasers-create-3-d-midair-plasma-displays-you-can-touch">Femtosecond Lasers Create 3-D Midair Plasma Displays You Can Touch</h2>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1CKkP3L"><strong>Artikel bei IEEE Spectrum</strong></a> — Ein neuer, von Forschern in Japan entwickelter Prototyp eines Hologramm-System hat zwei entscheidende Vorteile gegenüber anderen existierenden Hologramm-Prototypen (wie z.B. dem System von Aerial Burton ( <a href="https://youtu.be/GNoOiXkXmYQ">Video, englisch, ~2 min</a>): das erzeugte Hologramm verbrennt bei Berührung nicht die Haut — und man kann es berühren, und das sogar mit haptischem Feedback, will heissen: man spürt die Berührung. Wie das geht? Laserimpulse im Femtosekunden-Bereich <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> ionisieren Luftmoleküle, die dann überschüssige Energie in Form von blauweissen Photonen abgeben.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our system has the unique characteristic that the plasma is touchable. It was found that the contact between plasma and a finger causes a brighter light. This effect can be used as a cue of the contact. […]</p>
<p>Shock waves are generated by plasma when a user touches the plasma voxels. The user feels an impulse on the finger as if the light has physical substance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Der Prototyp ist derzeit noch recht unhandlich, die erzeugten Hologramme können max. 8 Kubikmillimeter groß sein. Trotzdem finde ich das System schon jetzt superfaszinierend.</p>
<p>Hier gibts noch ein <a href="https://youtu.be/AoWi10YVmfE">kurzes offizielles Erklärvideo (englisch, 3:20 min)</a>. Und wem das zu lang ist: eine <a href="http://zukun.tf/1CWy1CD">Bewegtbild-Vorführung in 4.5 Sekunden</a>.</p>

<h2 id="robot-exoskeletons-are-coming-to-japans-airports">Robot Exoskeletons Are Coming to Japan&rsquo;s Airports</h2>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1ClN6m6"><strong>Artikel bei Motherboard</strong></a> — Koffer zu schwer? Kein Problem. Die japanische Firma Cyberdyne stellt Exoskelette her, die Menschen mit schweren Lasten helfen. Im Haneda Airport in Tokyo wird Hilfspersonal mit <a href="http://zukun.tf/1JSimcu">3kg leichten Exoskeletten namens HAL</a> ausgerüstet, die im Bereich der Lendenwirbelsäule sitzen, und beim Heben und Tragen schwerer Lasten ihren Träger unterstützen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This device weighs around 3 kg and stays charged for up to three hours. It clips on around a wearer’s waist, and a computer, motors, and sensors within the device pick up bio-electric signals (BES) from a wearer’s muscles, prompting the suit to support the weight that the wearer is lifting. […]</p>
<p>The suit’s support level can also be adjusted, so if you’re lifting something really heavy, you can crank up the levels, and lower them when you’re only lifting lightweight objects. Ugi said that the device would help a person weighing around 50 kg lift a 20 kg-plus suitcase with ease.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Warum?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cyberdyne and JAT argue that while the need for airline services in the greater Tokyo area is continuing to grow, Japan is faced with a low birthrate and an ageing population; so, there are basically fewer workers to man the airports.</p>
<p>Enter super-workers clad in the exoskeletons, along with cleaning robots and transport robots that’ll supposedly keep any airport running like clockwork.</p>

<h2 id="printing-skin-cells-on-burn-wounds">Printing Skin Cells on Burn Wounds</h2>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1IXpPnP"><strong>Seite der Wake Forest School of Medicine</strong></a> — Forscher in North Carolina, USA, haben eine 3D-Druckmethode entwickelt, mit der tiefe Brandwunden auf der Haut behandelt werden können. Anders als bei traditionellen Behandlungsmethoden (Hautverpflanzungen von unversehrten Körperteilen) entnehmen die Forscher hier nur ein wenig Haut, extrahieren daraus diverse Zelltypen im Labor und vermehren diese. Später werden sie mit besagtem Drucker schichtweise auf die Wunde aufgetragen, um die Haut wiederherzustellen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The traditional treatment for deep burns is to cover them with healthy skin harvested from another part of the body. But in cases of extensive burns, there often isn’t enough healthy skin to harvest.</p>
<p>During phase I of AFIRM, WFIRM scientists designed, built and tested a printer designed to print skin cells onto burn wounds. The “ink” is actually different kinds of skin cells. A scanner is used to determine wound size and depth. Different kinds of skin cells are found at different depths. This data guides the printer as it applies layers of the correct type of cells to cover the wound. You only need a patch of skin one-tenth the size of the burn to grow enough skin cells for skin printing.</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to bring the technology to soldiers who need it within the next 5 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Den letzten Satz finde ich besonders interessant: der Zeitplan des Projekts sieht vor, dass diese Technologie spätestens 2020 in (Militär-)Kliniken zum Einsatz kommt.</p>

<h2 id="urbane-agrarwirtschaft">Urbane Agrarwirtschaft</h2>
<p>Überall auf der Welt wird an der Zukunft der “städtischen Landwirtschaft” gearbeitet. In einer ehemaligen Sony-Produktionsstätte in der japanischen Miyagi-Präfektur hat die Firma <a href="http://miraigroup.jp/en/">Mirai Co., Ltd.</a> auf 2322m² Fläche die bisher weltweit größte Indoor-Farm erbaut — und die produziert hocheffizient und ohne den Einsatz von Pestiziden pro Tag (!) 10.000 Salatköpfe.</p>
<p>Aus dem <a href="http://zukun.tf/1LMgeoW">Artikel beim National Geographic, “Inside the World’s Largest Indoor Farm”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shigeharu Shimamura, a plant physiologist and CEO of Mirai, has constructed the world’s largest indoor farm—25,000 square feet of futuristic garden beds nurtured by 17,500 LED lights in a bacteria-free, pesticide-free environment. The result? About 10,000 heads of fresh lettuce harvested each day.</p>
<p>The unique “plant factory” is so efficient that it cuts food waste from the 30 to 40 percent typically seen for lettuce grown outdoors to less than 3 percent for their coreless lettuce. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indoor-Farmen sind eine gute Idee, weil sie Nahrung im großen Stil dort erzeugen können, wo sie benötigt wird: in Städten. Und weil die Idee so gut ist, wird der Titel “größte Indoor-Farm” in Kürze in die USA gehen. (Zumindest für eine Weile, hehe.) Mehr darüber gibts in der <a href="http://nyti.ms/1CkxlW5">The New York Times: “In Newark, a Vertical Indoor Farm Helps Anchor an Area’s Revival”</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A former […] steel plant in the Ironbound section of Newark is being razed […] to make way for a giant custom-built complex for its sole tenant, AeroFarms, a company producing herbs and vegetables in an indoor, vertical environment. […]</p>
<p>Scheduled to open this fall inside the new Ironbound site, AeroFarms projects it will reap up to 30 harvests a year, or two million pounds of greens, including kale, arugula and romaine lettuce, Mr. Rosenberg said. At that output, AeroFarms would be among the most productive vertical farms in the country, analysts say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Und was ist mit Europa? Gute Frage! In London, bzw. <em>unter</em> London, gibt es mittlerweile Tunnelfarmen, berichtet <a href="http://zukun.tf/1NTAAf6">The Atlantic’s CityLab: “London’s Newest Urban Farm Is a Converted WWII Air Raid Shelter”</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>London’s newest urban farm proves that with the right equipment, you can grow food just about anywhere. The 1,805-square-foot carbon-neutral project has one of the strangest locations of any city horticulture project. It’s located 115 feet below a busy South London street, inside a sprawling World War Two air raid shelter. The new farm, run by the company Growing Underground, opened its doors to the press for the first time this week and will release its first crops onto the market later this month. […]</p>
<p>It’s the location that makes the project so striking. Located extremely close to Central London (and barely more than a mile from London’s wholesale produce market at New Covent Garden), the farm can get its crops onto restaurant plates within four hours of being harvested, which is both a boost to freshness and a fuel saver.</p>

<p>Today [Dr. Dennis Lo] is competing with labs around the world to repeat that scientific and commercial success by developing cancer screening tests based on a simple blood draw. That’s possible because dying cancer cells also shed DNA into a person’s blood. Early on, the amount is vanishingly small—and obscured by the healthy DNA that also circulates. That makes it difficult to measure. But Lo says the objective is simple: an annual blood test that finds cancer while it’s curable. […]</p>
<p>Building on the foundations put in place by doctors like Lo, commercial interest in liquid biopsies has recently started to explode. Eric Topol, a professor of genomics at the Scripps Research Institute, predicted this January that the technology, applied to cancer and other diseases, will become the “stethoscope for the next 200 years.”</p>

<h2 id="matternet-the-drone-delivery-startup-thats-actually-delivering">Matternet: The drone delivery startup that&rsquo;s actually delivering</h2>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1ChUCyn"><strong>Artikel bei Fortune</strong></a> — Und mal wieder ein Follow-Up, das mir am Herzen liegt. Im März 2014 schrieb ich über Matternet ( <a href="http://zukun.tf/1ChUeA8">Ausgabe #16, “Drohnen: es geht auch friedlich!”</a>), ein Startup, das ein Drohnen-basiertes Liefernetz für Medikamente und leichte Güter zum Einsatz in unwegigen Gebieten entwickelt. Die Firma stand im letzten Jahr nicht still, und setzt gerade ein Pilotprogramm in der Schweiz um, in Zusammenarbeit mit der Schweizer Post und dem Logistikunternehmen Swiss WorldCargo.</p>
<p>Und auch ihr kommerzielles Angebot steht in den Startlöchern: Matternet ONE, eine autarke Drohne.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The startup also recently announced that it will release the first commercial version of its technology, a $5,000 transport drone called the Matternet ONE. […] a relatively inexpensive, easy-to-use system controlled by an app that does all of the piloting and most of the mission planning itself. Packing a 3G or 4G SIM card, the drone stays connected to guidance software running in the cloud. The user simply has to tell the Matternet ONE where to go and the drone devises an appropriate route that avoids obstacles and restricted airspace. It can carry 2.2 pounds up to 12 miles on a single charge (charging stations placed along the route can extend that range). […]</p>
<p>Matternet field tested its drone technology, proving that its aircraft can fly in bad weather and beyond the line of sight of its operators. It proved it was adept at retrieving medical samples and delivering medicine to places that are often inaccessible due to poor roads, bad weather or other issues.</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1QQj7tf"><strong>Artikel bei KurzweilAI</strong></a> — Forschern am Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (DE) und dem Albany Medical Center (NY, USA) ist es gelungen, flüssig gesprochene Sätze anhand von Hirnwellen zu erkennen und in Text umzuwandeln. Die Hoffnung ist, langfristig Menschen wieder eine Stimme zu geben, die aus gesundheitlichen Gründen nicht mehr sprechen können. (Oder in der Zukunft endlich im Kino auch ohne Smartphone in der Hand still zu chatten.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>German and U.S. researchers have decoded natural continuously spoken speech from brain waves and transformed it into text — a step toward communication with computers or humans by thought alone.</p>
<p>Their “Brain-to-Text” system recorded signals from an electrocorticographic (ECoG) electrode array located on relevant surfaces of the frontal and temporal lobes of the cerebral cortex of seven epileptic patients, who participated voluntarily in the study during their clinical treatment.</p>
<p>The patients read sample text (from a limited set of words) aloud during the study. Machine learning algorithms were then used to extract the most likely word sequence from the signals, and automatic speech-to-text methods created the text output. The system achieved word error rates as low as 25% and phone (instances of phonemes in utterances) error rates below 50%.</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1RwEAlU"><strong>Artikel beim MIT Tech Review</strong></a> — Um das Hirn besser zu verstehen, muss man das Hirn besser beobachten. Gar nicht so einfach, wenn man die elektrischen Signale der Neuronen nicht auslesen kann, sind sie doch …die Butter auf …dem Hirn-Brot. (Ugh.) Bisher verwendet die Wissenschaft für derlei Experimente relativ starre Elektroden, die aufgrund ihrer Struktur jedoch sehr invasiv sind. Um diese Situation zu verbessern, haben Forscher an der Harvard University ein hauchfeines Netz entwickelt, dass elektrisch leitet, sich dem umgebenden Gewebe anpassen kann und mit ihm mitwächst, und so filigran ist, dass es über eine Injektion (!) platziert werden kann.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They developed a scaffold-like structure that could support the growth of cells in three dimensions, similar to how it happens in the body, and also house electronic sensors for taking measurements from those cells. That demonstration suggested that the technology was potentially useful for measuring cellular activity. […]</p>
<p>the mesh is composed of nanoscale metal wires and polymers. Tiny electronic devices, such as sensors and electrode stimulators, can be built into it. A scaffold that is a centimeter and a half in width can fold into a size small enough to be injectable through a needle whose diameter is just a few hundred micrometers. Once inside the body, it unfolds to conform to its 3-D environment. When it encounters a ventricular cavity in the brain, for example, it can unfold to fill in the space, bridging the two sides. Over time, neurons integrate with the mesh, providing the opportunity to record from or stimulate many single cells in a given region.</p>

<p>Und je besser das Hirn erforscht wird, desto höher ist die Chance, dass meine Metaphern irgendwann mal besser werden.</p>

<h2 id="the-official-spacex-hyperloop-pod-competition">The Official SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition</h2>
<p>Promobild: SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop"><strong>Ankündigung bei SpaceX</strong></a> — Mitte des Monats gab SpaceX bekannt, in Kalifornien einen 1.6km langen Hyperloop-Test-Track<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> bauen zu wollen, um interessierten Teams die Möglichkeit zu eröffnen, ihre Hyperloop-Designs auf Herz und Nieren zu testen. Ich finde das Hyperloop-Konzept absolut faszinierend; nicht zuletzt, weil es mich an die Zeichnungen von futuristischen High-Speed-Röhrenbahnen erinnert, die ich in den Beschreibungen der Zukunft in alten Büchern aus den 1950ern und 1960ern gelesen habe. Ah, Retro Future! ♥</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since we first unveiled the idea for a new high-speed ground transport system called the Hyperloop back in 2013, there has been a tremendous amount of interest in the concept. We are excited that a handful of private companies have chosen to pursue this effort. […]</p>
<p>For this reason, SpaceX is announcing an open competition, geared towards university students and independent engineering teams, to design and build the best Hyperloop pod. To support this competition, SpaceX will construct a one-mile test track adjacent to our Hawthorne, California headquarters. Teams will be able to test their human-scale pods during a competition weekend at the track, currently targeted for June 2016. The knowledge gained here will continue to be open-sourced.</p>

<p>Innerhalb der ersten Woche gingen bei SpaceX <a href="https://twitter.com/Hyperloop/status/613098438276702208">über 700 Anmeldungen für den Wettbewerb ein</a>.</p>
<p>Hyperloop hat eigentlich nichts mit SpaceX zu tun; das verbindende Glied in dieser Geschichte ist Elon Musk, der das Konzept entworfen hat, und derzeit mehrere Chef-Posten bei SpaceX besetzt.</p>

<p>[DARPA] is on the verge of a revolutionary way of preventing mass outbreaks of diseases like Ebola. If the system worked, many pandemic scenarios could be crossed off the “How the Apocalypse Could Happen” list. […]</p>
<p>Briefly, [Colonel Dan Wattendorf] explains, DARPA’s system would work like this: powerful antibodies would be isolated from survivors of a communicable disease, and the plans for making those antibodies would be encoded in RNA or DNA, then pumped into people who might come into contact with the disease. The cells in these people’s bodies would suck in the genetic material and start cranking out these high-performing antibodies. Any single human’s immunological innovation could be spread to the rest of humanity, protecting us all. The process would be faster and cheaper than previous methods of making vaccines and it would be widely applicable to all kinds of […] emerging diseases.</p>

<h2 id="brain-controlled-bionic-legs-are-finally-here">Brain-Controlled Bionic Legs Are Finally Here</h2>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1Nir3hf"><strong>Artikel bei Popular Science</strong></a> — Die Firma Össur hat bionische Fußprothesen entwickelt, die sozusagen einen direkten Draht zum Hirn ihres Besitzers haben.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a full decade, Gudmundur Olafsson was unable to move his right ankle. That’s because it wasn’t there. [Olafsson’s amputated lower leg was the delayed casualty of an accident from his childhood in Iceland, when he was hit by an oil truck. “I lived in pain for 28 years,” says Olafsson. “After 50-plus operations, I had it off.” […] For years after the operation he wore a Proprio Foot, a prosthetic with a motorized, battery-powered ankle, sold by the Reykjavik-based company Ossur. […]</p>
<p>But 14 months ago Ossur upgraded his hardware. Now, at age 48, Olafsson can move his right ankle by thinking about it. When the electrical impulse from his brain reaches the base of his leg, a pair of sensors embedded in his muscle tissue connect the neural dots, and wirelessly transmit that signal to the Proprio Foot. Since the command reaches the foot before the wearer’s residual muscles actually contract, there’s no unnatural lag between intention and action.</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1JjhVdQ"><strong>Artikel bei MIT Technology Review</strong></a> — Die Menschheit ist jetzt offiziell an dem Punkt angekommen, wo sie Nano-Halbleiter mit Bakterien koppeln kann, um eine künstliche Form der Photosynthese einzuleiten.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, say that by combining nanoscale materials with bacteria, they have opened the door to a new way of designing systems that could efficiently turn carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into useful organic compounds—similar to what plants do through photosynthesis. Down the road, they say, the system could become a commercially viable way to produce high-value chemicals like drug precursors used by the pharmaceutical industry, or to store renewable energy in the form of liquid fuels. […]</p>
<p>The new system is the first one in which semiconductors, which are capable of both capturing solar energy and transmitting electricity to the microbes, have been directly combined with bacteria, says Peidong Yang, a professor of chemistry and materials science at the University of California, Berkeley, and an inventor of the system. Previous similar systems have relied on bulky solar panels to provide renewable electricity […] In this case, semiconducting nanowires capture energy from sunlight and pass electrons to electrotrophic bacteria, which are nestled within the wires. The electrotrophs use the electrons to turn carbon dioxide and water into useful chemical building blocks.</p>

<h2 id="blueprint-for-a-better-human-body">Blueprint for a Better Human Body</h2>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1HeOOb2"><strong>Artikel in The Atlantic</strong></a> — Und hier noch ein abschliessender Lesetipp fürs Wochenende. Da gehts um ein Thema, das mich persönlich sehr fasziniert und das sich auch <a href="http://zukun.tf/1NirdW8">in meinen Ansichten zur Evolution</a> wiederfindet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More and more amputees, engineers, and prospective cyborgs are rejecting the idea that the “average” human body is a necessary blueprint for their devices. <em>“We have this strong picture of us as human beings with two legs, two hands, and one head in the middle,”</em> says Stefan Greiner, the founder of Cyborgs eV, a Berlin-based group of body hackers. <em>“But there’s actually no reason that the human body has to look like as it has looked like for thousands of years.”</em> […]</p>
<p>What was once an industry bent on replicating the human body exactly, the world of prosthetics has started thinking more creatively about what the human body can be. As technology advances, as engineers start to borrow ideas and designs not just from human biology but from elsewhere, and as prosthetics become less stigmatized, there are all sorts of options opening up. The human body, and what people consider the “normal” human body, can be a whole lot more than what’s biologically possible.</p>

			 <p>Donnerstagmorgen sind dafür da, die letzten drei NadZ-losen Monate zu vergessen. <em>Poof!</em> Und schon sind sie weg! Gute Arbeit, lieber Leser.</p>
<p>Wenn ich die letzten Wochen/Monate zusammenfassen müsste, dann ungefähr so: Viel zu tun, zu wenig Zeit für NadZ. Das muss <strong>und wird</strong> sich ändern! Ich hatte zwar schon länger geplant, wieder mehr zu schreiben, aber dann passierte DAS LEBEN, die Zeit verflog, und die Artikel blieben in meinem Kopf liegen. Letzte Woche wurde mir dann klar, dass wenn NadZ endlich wieder regelmäßig(er) erscheinen soll, ich einfach Änderungen vornehmen <strong>muss</strong>. Anders oder gar nicht. Und <em>“gar nicht”</em> mag ich gar nicht!</p>
<p>So wird der Newsletter für die absehbare Zukunft etwas kürzer, kompakter; etwas mehr Wegweiser ( <em>“hier, interessante Stories zum Selbst-Lesen”</em>) und weniger Erklärbär ( <em>“Wat is ‘n Dampfmaschin’?”</em>).</p>

Das Feld der Neurowissenschaften wird gerade neu bestellt, und Milliarden von Euro fliessen in die Forschung.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] Cindy Kelly, a 48-year-old mother of two, had suffered from depression on and off for 20 years until a final debilitating bout that was making it hard for her to work or relate to other people. Getting into a clinical trial for one of Naurex’s drugs changed her life.</p>
<p>“Within 15 minutes my symptoms were gone, and it was like magic,” she says. The effect wore off a week later, and she fought to get into a second study that would allow her to take the medicine again. She succeeded, and after several treatments her depression is gone, seemingly for good. […]</p>
<p>TREATMENTS LIKE SAGE’S ARE JUST THE START of the changes scientists hope to bring about in the way we battle brain disease. Right now, for instance, patients who go to see a psychiatrist often get put on a medication based simply on what a patient tells them about how they’re feeling. When one medication doesn’t work (which is more than half the time) the doctor tries another, or a combination of drugs, based on his or her experience and gut feeling about what will work. […]</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1cGYxIT"><strong>Artikel bei Golem</strong></a> — Forscher beschiessen Graphenknödel mit Licht. Graphenknödel bewegt sich überraschend vorwärts. Forscher perplex, wiederholen das Experiment, gleiches Ergebnis. Vermutung: das Graphen absorbiert die Energie des Lasers und baut eine Elektronenladung auf; wird diese zu groß, werden überschüssige Elektronen abgestoßen, was für “Schub” sorgt. Jetzt wird überlegt, ob sich diese Technik nicht in einem Antrieb für Raumfahrzeuge verarbeiten lässt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Die Forscher von der Nankai-Universität in Tianjin, etwa 120 Kilometer südöstlich von Peking, wollten herausfinden, ob die praktischen Eigenschaften des Graphens auch bei größeren Anordnungen erhalten bleiben. Graphen ist sehr fest und ein sehr guter elektrischer und thermischer Leiter.</p>
<p>Die Forscher stellten einen mehrere Zentimeter großen Schwamm aus Graphen her, um das zu untersuchen. Hergestellt hatten sie ihn aus zusammengeknitterten Blättchen aus Graphitoxid, die sie miteinander verschmolzen hatten. Als sie den Schwamm mit einem Laser zerschneiden wollten, machte dieser einen Satz nach vorne.</p>
<p>Das Phänomen ließ sich wiederholen: Die Forscher steckten den Graphenschwamm in eine Vakuumkammer und setzten ihn Laser mit verschiedenen Intensitäten und Wellenlängen aus. Das gebündelte Licht bewegte den Schwamm bis zu 40 Zentimeter. Das klappte auch mit Sonnenlicht, das mit einer Lupe auf den Schwamm fokussiert wurde.</p>

engineer rat forelimbs with functioning vascular and muscle tissue. They
also provided evidence that the same approach could be applied to the limbs
of primates.</p>

<p>The current study uses technology […] in which living cells are stripped
from a donor organ with a detergent solution and the remaining matrix is
then repopulated with progenitor cells appropriate to the specific organ.
His team and others at MGH and elsewhere have used this decellularization
technique to regenerate kidneys, livers, hearts and lungs from animal

genomics and cancer-treatments lab — and who has called raising
animals for food “a completely shitty, useless industry in every

<em>it’s just a question of who takes it down and how soon.”</em> You might
be able to guess who he says will help him do that: <em>“Our target</em>
<em>market is not vegetarians. It’s not vegans. It’s not fringy health</em>
<em>nuts. It’s not food-fad faddists. It’s mainstream, mass-market,</em>
<em>uncompromising, meat-loving carnivores.”</em> Citing a U.N. calculation
that 30 percent of the planet’s land is used for animal
agriculture, he hopes his plan will <em>“change the way Earth looks</em>
<em>from space.”</em> <em>“The way that we’re going to monitor our progress,”</em> he says, <em>“is by looking at Google Earth, basically.”</em></p>

<h2 id="zukunft-der-arbeit-die-digitalisierung-braucht-eine-soziale-agenda">Zukunft der Arbeit: Die Digitalisierung braucht eine soziale Agenda</h2>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1cGYsVH"><strong>Artikel beim Handelsblatt</strong></a> — Das Handelsblatt macht sich Gedanken über die Gesellschaft im 21. Jahrhundert. Nicht über die zweite Hälfte des 21. Jahrhunderts, sondern die nächsten paar Jahre: der Wandel wartet schliesslich nicht.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aber auch wenn die Digitalisierung in Deutschland mehr – vor allem
hochwertige – Jobs schafft, bedeutet Strukturwandel, dass
vorübergehend Arbeitsplätze wegfallen und es zu beruflicher Um- und
Neuorientierung kommen muss. Somit ist eine rein
marktwirtschaftliche Digitalisierung ohne Korrekturen durch den
Staat eine große Gefahr.</p>
<p>Die Schlussfolgerung für die Digitalisierung kann also nur lauten,
dass sie in jedem Fall eine soziale Agenda braucht. Es braucht
erstens eine starke Grundsicherung. Es braucht zweitens auch einen
vorsorgenden Sozialstaat, der in die Befähigung und Qualifizierung
der Menschen investieren kann.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ein sehr interessantes, sehr schwieriges, sehr wichtiges Thema. Wer derzeit (wie ich) um die 40 ist, und davon ausgeht, dass die Welt ungefähr so bleibt, bis er/sie in Rente geht, für den habe ich ganz schlechte Nachrichten — wegschauen und hoffen wird in diesem Fall nicht funktionieren. Denn das wird sie nicht, und das mit dem Rentensystem… nunja.</p>
<p>Sorry, das Neue in der Zukunft ist nicht immer nur problemlos und großartig, Leute. Da müssen wir zusammen durch! :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In den letzten Wochen wurde viel über BRETT berichtet, einen Roboter der Universität Berkeley. BRETT kann Handtücher falten, Lego-artige Steinchen zusammenstecken und Deckel auf Flaschen drehen. Das klingt gar nicht so spannend — doch niemand hat BRETT erklärt, wie er diese Aufgaben genau lösen soll. BRETT hat das selbst gelernt.

<h2 id="microsoft-hololens-hologramme-für-alle">Microsoft HoloLens: Hologramme für alle!</h2>
<p>Microsoft HoloLens. Quelle: Microsoft</p>
<p>Im Januar stellte Microsoft der Welt sein neues <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us">Augmented-Reality-Projekt “HoloLens”</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> vor: eine Mischung aus Brille und Helm, die virtuelle 3D-Objekte und die echte Umgebung vermischt. Ein paar Monate später zeigten sie auf der Entwicklerkonferenz Build 2015 eine Live-Demo, in der sie das Gerät mehr oder weniger vorn auf eine Kamera schnallten. Das Resultat ist <a href="https://youtu.be/hglZb5CWzNQ">ein recht beeindruckendes Video</a>.</p>
<p>Natürlich darf man nicht vergessen, dass es eine von MS kontrollierte Demonstration war. Zwar war sich die Fachpresse nach eigenen Vor-Ort-Tests sicher, es hier mit einem <em>game changer</em> zu tun zu haben, trotzdem gab es auch einige <em>“Saucool, aber…”</em>-Reaktionen. Die Technologie-Site <a href="http://zukun.tf/1cGYv3M">The Verge fasste den aktuellen Stand von HoloLens z.B. so zusammen</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But HoloLens only feels natural when you’re not handling anything much bigger than a basketball. It produces a magic square the size of a large TV screen, and the moment something slips outside, it disappears. It’s possible to imagine that a small object has just dipped out of sight, but for a larger one, you either have to step quite a ways back or content yourself with just seeing pieces of it in the center of your vision. It shatters the illusion, and it looks very little like the amazing whole-world illusions of Microsoft’s videos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ich glaube nichtsdestotrotz, dass Microsoft da in eine sehr vielversprechende Richtung marschiert.</p>

			 <p><strong>Replacing the Evernote Web Clipper Chrome extension with a Keyboard Maestro macro for better bookmarking: with searchable full-text content and full-size screenshots.</strong></p>
<p>I like <a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a> a lot. It&rsquo;s my external memory — I put everything in there, from quick notes to directions to recipes to trip planning to bookmarks.  Since I am a heavy Google Chrome user, I am/was using the <a href="https://evernote.com/webclipper/">Evernote Web Clipper</a> extension, Evernote&rsquo;s official solution to <em>&ldquo;Collect the best of the web, all in one place. Quickly and easily clip articles, text, and images right into Evernote.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, up until a few weeks ago, the extension would only function by injecting <code>iframe</code>s and scripts into each page I would visit, on the off chance that I might use the Web Clipper on that particular page.  This —for me— posed several issues.  For one, being a frontend developer I have Chrome&rsquo;s web inspector open pretty much all the time, and every now and then the extension would log errors that would show up in the console, throwing me off.  Irritating, to say the least, especially when I was in the middle of a heavy debugging session.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll spare you the rest of my other niggles with the addon.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong here, it is both usable and useful, and certainly a boon to most people, but some of its facets <em>I</em> just did not like.  For example, the Web Clipper is storing the clip/bookmark on the EN server, from where it would then later sync to my local client.  While I understand the technical reasons for this, I think that&rsquo;s backwards — when I take a note I want to see it <em>without</em> the need to sync first.</p>
<p>Also, even though I was employing it heavily, the only thing I really used it for was for bookmarking pages.  I do not have a need for its other features, like cutting pieces of an article or making it more readable or taking screenshots.</p>
<p>Hence, I decided to replace the Evernote Web Clipper with a <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a> macro.  (If you have no idea yet as to what KM is, check out the link.  I&rsquo;ll wait.)</p>
<h2 id="what-the-macro-does">What the macro does</h2>
<p>Once triggered, the macro will get URL, title, meta description and a <em>very</em> simple text excerpt from the current page in the browser.  Also, a screenshot of the browser window is captured.</p>
<p>Then, it&rsquo;ll use these bits to compose a formatted (HTML) note in Evernote.</p>
<p>And to top it all off, it&rsquo;ll display a notification, using either the excellent <a href="https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier">terminal-notifier</a> (when installed) or KM&rsquo;s default notification action.</p>
<p>Bonus: if <code>terminal-notifier</code> was found and used, clicking the notification will open Evernote.</p>
<p>The note is stored locally first, and then synchronized to the remote Evernote server.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-expect-from-it">What to expect from it</h2>
<p>This is what a bookmark made with the Evernote Web Clipper looks like in Evernote (<a href="https://attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2015-05-screenshot-bookmark-web-clipper.jpg">bigger version</a>).  The image is the first image the Clipper found on the page (I&rsquo;m just guessing here):</p>

			 <p>Awesome.  Everything&rsquo;s awesome.  Everybody&rsquo;s awesome.  So much awesome.  All the time, 24/7, maybe more!  And I get it: this is the 21st century.  All the things are totally amazeballs, without exception.  We&rsquo;re all winners, all of us.  Top of the game, thanks for playing, y&rsquo;all.</p>
<p>Anyways, I see your plight.  It&rsquo;s 20 minutes until that big meeting.  You&rsquo;re about to present your (baking soda volcano / disruptive startup / marriage proposal / weird old trick) to (a pack of super-critical VC&rsquo;s / traffic cop / an angry axe murderer / the Gods / HackerNews), and your pitch contains 200 instances of the word &ldquo;awesome&rdquo; while being 300 words long.  That&rsquo;s clearly less than ideal.  Your future (well-being / monies / job / sex life / accommodation) depends on these five minutes.</p>
<p>Fret not.  I&rsquo;m here to help.  Take your pick from these fine alternative to the blatantly overused word &ldquo;awesome&rdquo;.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>&ldquo;good&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;nice&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;slightly amusing&rdquo;</em></li>

<li><em>&quot;… err, does anyone here know how to use a dictionary? No? Well then. As I was saying…&quot;</em></li>
</ol>
<p>At that point, &ldquo;awesome&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a word anymore, it&rsquo;s a fucking comma.  Making an originally exceptional term meaningless just because we don&rsquo;t know any words — that&rsquo;s not cool, you guys.</p>

			 <p>Donnerstagmorgen sind dafür da, um sich zu auf den Frühstückssmoothie zu freuen. Bis die echten Anti-Aging-Pillen auf den Markt kommen, werden noch ein paar Jahre vergehen, und bis dahin muss ich unbedingt gesund bleiben…</p>
<p>Die erste Ausgabe in diesem Jahr ist —zu meiner eigenen Überraschung!— tatsächlich schon die #30. Dreissig! Hot damn. Bloss nicht nachlassen, oh Gott! Also habe ich ein paar gute Themen zusammengetragen in den letzten zwei Monaten. Diesmal gehts u.A. um die Marktzulassung des ersten Exoskeletts für Querschnittgelähmte, die mich tatsächlich glauben lässt, dass derlei Geräte schon in wenigen Jahren vielen Menschen aus ihrem Rollstuhl helfen werden. Und um Trinkwasser, und die Hoffnung, dass weltweite Knappheit in Zukunft vermieden werden kann. Und darum, dass das Leben in der Tat immer schneller wird, und wir uns das nicht einbilden. Hurra!</p>
<p>Und, was nicht ganz so toll ist, es gibt schlechte Nachrichten für die Unterstützung via <a href="http://patreon.com">Patreon</a>. Seit Anfang 2015 gilt in der EU eine neue Regelung für digitale Käufe (u.A.), die es für mich komplett unrentabel macht, Patreon zu benutzen. Aus diesem Grund habe ich alle bestehenden Pledges dankend von meiner Seite aus aufgelöst — der Aufwand, den ich betreiben müsste, um Patreon weiter zu nutzen, stünde in keinem Verhältnis zum Nutzen. Die Site macht sichs da einfach; das kann ich teilweise nachvollziehen, aber es hilft mir nicht weiter. Tja. Wer mehr zu diesem ungemein erheiternden Thema wissen möchte, sollte nach <em>“Umsatzsteuer EU Mini-One-Stop-Shop”</em> googlen. Yay.</p>

<h2 id="hiv--und-syphilis-tests-mit-dem-smartphone">HIV- und Syphilis-Tests mit dem Smartphone</h2>
<p>Die University of Columbia hat ein Smartphone-Addon entwickelt, das schnell und zuverlässig HIV- und Syphilis-Antikörper in winzigen Blutproben erkennt. Der Clou dabei: das Gerät kostet $34; die Ausgaben für die Probenbehälter, die die zu testenden Blutstropfen “verarbeiten”, bewegen sich im Cent-Bereich. In Ruanda wurde das Gerät jetzt erstmalig in einem Feldversuch mit 96 Schwangeren eingesetzt.</p>
<p>Und so funktionierts: dem Patienten wird an der Fingerspitze etwas Blut entnommen. Das Gerät mischt dann diese Tropfen in ihrem Probenbehälter mit Reagenzien: enthaltene Gold-Nanopartikel spüren eventuell vorhandene Antikörper auf, binden sich an sie, Silver-Nanopartikel reagieren dann mit den Gold-Nanopartikeln, und nach 15 min ist die Analyse komplett und wird im Smartphone gespeichert.</p>
<p>Bis jetzt konnten solche Tests nur im Labor von Spezialisten auf Geräten durchgeführt werden, die mehrere Tausend Euro kosten. Das Smartphone-Addon ist günstiger, nur so groß wie ein iPhone, und das Training für das medizinische Personal benötigt, um die Bedienung zu erlernen, nimmt eine halbe Stunde in Anspruch.</p>

<h2 id="laser-sensor-für-hirntumorzellen">Laser-Sensor für Hirntumorzellen</h2>
<p>Wissenschaftler aus Kanada haben ein handliches optisches Messgerät entwickelt, das Hirnkrebszellen erkennen kann. Der bleistiftgroße Sensor identifiziert mittels Laserstrahlen krebsartige Zellen, und erlaubt es Chirurgen, während einer Operation schnell und non-destruktiv zu testen, ob Gewebe gesund ist oder Teil eines Tumors. (Der Sensor an sich ist handlich, aber ein dünnes Kabel verbindet ihn mit einer größeren Haupteinheit.)</p>
<p>Herkömmliche Technologie wie z.B. Magnetresonanztomographie erkennt nach Angabe der kanadischen Mediziner zwar größere Tumore, aber Krebszellen, die sich in der Peripherie eines Tumors entwickelt haben, fallen oft durchs Raster. Ihr neuer Sensor ist dafür gemacht, solche Zellen während eines Eingriffs zu erkennen, damit sie entfernt werden können, was die Remissionrate des Patienten erhöhen dürfte.</p>

<p>Die weltgrößte Meerwasserentsalzunganlage, die auf Umkehrosmose-Basis arbeitet, steht in Sorek, Israel. Sie ist seit 2013 im Betrieb, wird aber erst jetzt auf volle Last hochgefahren: auf 627.000.000 Liter pro Tag (627.000 m³). Damit liefert sie genug Frischwasser für rund 20% der Haushalte im Land, und zeigt, dass Desalination in einem so irre großen Maßstab machbar ist.</p>
<p>Vor 10 Jahren war Israel noch komplett auf Regen- und Grundwasser angewiesen. Mittlerweile beherbergt das Land vier Seewasser-Entsalzungsanlagen, die zusammen 40% des Wasserbedarfs decken. Weitere Einrichtungen sind in Arbeit, und schon 2016 sollen es dann mehr als 50% sein.</p>
<p>Die Anlage in Sorek überwindet einige Hürden, die den Prozess der Umkehrosmose immer etwas unwirtschaftlich gemacht haben, wie z.B. den hohen Energieaufwand. Dank technologischer und materialtechnischer Neuentwicklungen kann Sorek im laufenden Betrieb 1.000 Liter Trinkwasser für ~€0,35 erzeugen, was ich ziemlich beeindruckend finde. Das Wasser verkauft der Betreiber dann für ~€0,51 weiter, z.B. an die staatlichen Wasserwirtschaft.</p>
<p>Und die Entwicklung bleibt nicht stehen: Lockheed Martin und einige andere Spieler arbeiten an Desalinatoren auf Graphen-Basis. Hauchdünne Filter des Materials, nur 1 Atom dick, durch die Wasser hindurchfliesst, das enthaltene Salz aber hängenbleibt. Bald…</p>

<p>Schon im Juni 2014 wurde von der US-amerikanischen FDA<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> das ReWalk-System für den privaten Heimgebrauch zugelassen. ReWalk ist ein robotisches Exoskelett, das querschnittgelähmten Personen das Gehen ermöglicht. Der Träger schnallt sich dabei in eine Art motorisiertes Gestell (das Exoskelett), das den Prozess der Bewegung übernimmt.</p>
<p>ReWalk’s computergesteuertes Kontrollsystem, das sich in einer Art Rucksack versteckt, steuert die Bewegungseinheit, die drei Modi beherrscht: Stehen, Sitzen und Gehen. Die Motoren an den Gelenken werden durch Akkus mit Strom versorgt, eine kabellose Fernbedienung am Handgelenk des Trägers schaltet zwischen den Modi um. Krücken sind für die Stabilisierung beim Gehen nötig.</p>
<p>Alles in allem sehr, sehr beeindruckend und anscheinend lebensverändernd (Link zu einem deutschsprachigen Video-Erfahrungsbericht weiter unten). Aktuell ist das System mit ca. €61.000 (~$70.000) noch nicht wirklich günstig, aber auf dem Feld passiert gerade Einiges (siehe NadZ #27 zum “Soft Exosuit”) — ich denke, die Preise werden in den nächsten paar Jahre deutlich fallen, während die Auswahl an solchen Geräten steigt.</p>

<h2 id="10-stärkerer-stahl-dank-nano-laminierung">10× stärkerer Stahl dank Nano-Laminierung</h2>
<p>Das in Seattle heimische Startup Modumetal, Inc. hat vor einigen Jahren einen relativ simplen und kostengünstigen Prozess entwickelt, um Metalle zu “nano-laminieren”. So behandelte Metallteile werden bis zu 10× stärker und reissfester, und viel unempfindlicher gegenüber Korrosion.</p>
<p>Ein Stahlteil wird dabei in einen Tank mit einer Flüssigkeit getaucht, die diverse Metallionen enthält. Auf das Teil werden dann nacheinander unterschiedliche elektrische Spannungen gelegt; jede dieser Spannungen bringt eine Art Metallionen dazu, sich an den Stahl zu heften. Nach und nach entstehen dann mehrere Schichten, die auf Nano-Ebene miteinander agieren, und dem Stahlteil nachträglich zusätzliche Eigenschaften verleihen.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Modumetal’s Prozess ist vor Kurzem dem Prototypen-Stadium entwachsen, und derart nano-laminierte Teile werden jetzt auf diversen Ölfeldern in den USA getestet. Dort wird teilweise mit hochaggressiven Chemikalien hantiert, was besondere Anforderungen an die Stahlteile stellt. Sollten sie sich beweisen können, wäre das ein großer Erfolg für die Firma, denn obwohl diese Technologie schon länger bekannt ist, war sie doch bis jetzt immer nur etwas fürs Labor. Modumetal hat es geschafft, sie in eine für die Industrie interessanten Größenordnung zu transformieren.</p>
<p>Und rein theoretisch heisst das ja auch, dass man, würde diese Technik überall zur Anwendung kommen, auch weit weniger Rohmaterial bräuchte. Das kann nicht schlecht sein, oder?</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1EsFixv"><strong>MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2015</strong></a> — Das MIT Tech Review hat ihre jährliche Liste von “Durchbrüchen” zusammengestellt: Entwicklungen, die zwar unter dem Radar der Massenmedien durchgeflogen sind, aber so grundlegend Neues hervorgebracht haben, dass sie ganze Industriezweige und Lebensbereiche umkrempeln können (und sehr vermutlich auch werden). Interessant, nicht zuletzt auch wegen der zeitlichen Schätzung, ab wann diese Entwicklungen verfügbar sein werden.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1EsFih8"><strong>The Acceleration of Acceleration: How The Future Is Arriving Far Faster Than Expected</strong></a> — Die Bestseller-Autoren Steven Kotler und Ken Goffman beschreibe anhand verschiedener aktueller Beispiele, warum sie mittlerweile davon überzeugt sind, dass sich die technologische Beschleunigung, die wir erleben, immer weiter beschleunigt. Sie sehen, dass viele der zeitlichen Voraussagen, die sie noch vor wenigen Jahren gemacht haben, und die damals überaus optimistisch klangen, überraschenderweise viel zu konservativ waren:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] In 2011, when Peter Diamandis and I were writing that book, we were somewhat cautious with our vision for robotics, arguing that we were still ten to fifteen years away from a major shift.</p>
<p>And we were wrong.</p>
<p>Just three years later, Google went on a buying spree, purchasing eight different robotics companies in less than six months, Amazon decided it was time to get into the drone delivery (aka flying robots) business, and Rethink Robotics released Baxter (a story explored in my new release Bold), the first user-friendly industrial robot to hit the market.

<p>Der sich beschleunigende Wandel (siehe <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change">Wikipedia</a>) wird spürbar.</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1FtrdOz"><strong>NASA Emdrive experiments have force measurements while the device is in a hard vacuum</strong></a> — Die Älteren erinnern sich: <a href="http://zukun.tf/1AWKoly">in Ausgabe #24 im August 2014 berichtete ich davon</a>, dass die NASA beschlossen hat, sich das etwas wirr klingende EmDrive-Konzept im Labor anzuschauen. Das EmDrive ist ein Antrieb für Raumfahrzeuge, der keine Masse auswirft (Brennstoff, Flammen, Explosionen etc.), aber trotzdem Schub in der Form von Mikrowellen erzeugt. Unmöglich laut Allem, was wir über Physik wissen, jedoch gab es genug erfolgreiche Meldungen von unabhängigen Laboren, um die NASA dazu zu bringen, selbst einen Prototypen zu testen.</p>
<p>Das ist die letzten Monate über passiert, und Anfang Februar gab es dann die ersten positiven Ergebnisse. Besagter Prototyp wurde in einem Vakuum hochgefahren, und es konnte tatsächlich Schubkraft gemessen werden. Warum? Das wissen auch die klugen Köpfe bei der NASA noch nicht wirklich, spekulieren tun sie allerdings schon.</p>
<p>Und was das jetzt bedeutet, <a href="http://zukun.tf/1EsFhtv">erklärt in einfachen Worten Reddit-User RadGrinArcher</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s supposedly a system capable of providing thrust without expelling any mass, using microwaves generated inside a cavity. By our picture of physics, not possible. Physicists are unsure how it could work, but one theory I have read is that it pushes on “virtual” particles which come into and out of existence in the quantum vacuum as things randomly rearrange. A few teams around the world reported that it worked, so NASA decided to test it themselves. The article is put together from statements that one of the scientists has made, and basically says they measured thrust when operating in hard vacuum. If confirmation continues we will have to rewrite the physics textbooks, and if not we might learn something else valuable about physics anyway.</p>
<p>In terms of what it could mean, basically the solar system opens up, and the space around us too. The only fuel is electricity, which we can of course obtain with solar panels near the sun or heat-based radioactive material reactors farther out. […]</p>

<p>Zwei Monate sind vergangen seit der letzten Ausgabe. So lang sollte die Pause eigentlich nicht sein, aber ich habe viel um die Ohren und den Kopf nicht frei genug fürs Schreiben. Passiert! Meine Hoffnung ist, dass 2015 ein besseres Jahr wird, in dem ich dann auch wieder mehr Luft für <em>NadZ</em> haben werde.</p>
<p>Aber 2014 — was für ein Jahr! <a href="https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues">17 Ausgaben <em>NadZ</em></a> habe ich veröffentlich (inklusive dieser hier), bin 40 geworden, ich wurde <a href="http://zukun.tf/1nh685o">für den Grimme Online Award nominiert</a>, hab ihn nicht gewonnen und <a href="https://www.facebook.com/neuesausderzukunft">meine Facebook-Seite</a> hat immer noch keine Million Gefälltmirs.

<h2 id="erste-gentherapie-in-deutschland-zugelassen">Erste Gentherapie in Deutschland zugelassen</h2>
<p>In Europa wurde erstmals eine Gentherapie am freien Markt zugelassen, und wo zuerst? In Deutschland! Seit Anfang November ist das Mittel namens Glybera erhältlich, das die <em>sehr</em> seltene, erbliche Stoffwechselkrankheit Lipoproteinlipase-Defizienz heilt.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Bei LPLD-Betroffenen sammelt sich mit der Nahrung eingenommenes Fett im Blut, was oft zu lebensgefährlichen, wiederholten Entzündungen der Bauchspeicheldrüse führen kann. Bisher gab es keine nachhaltigen Behandlungsmöglichkeiten. (Für mehr Hintergrundinfos empfehle ich den weiter unten verlinkten Motherboard-Artikel.)</p>
<p>Glybera kann das richten! Diese Gentherapie benötigt ca. 42 Injektionen, bis der Patient geheilt ist. Das klingt nicht so schlimm – allerdings kostet jede Injektion um die €50.000, eine vollständige Heilung schlägt so mit ungefähr €1,1 mio zu Buche.</p>
<p>Autsch… Einerseits freut mich die Meldung an sich (Gentherapie <em>fuck yeah</em>), andererseits sind die Kosten im Moment halt noch kriminell hoch. Egal: Fortschritt!</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Klar, das ist wahnsinnig viel Geld, und der Patientenpool ist winzig, handelt es sich bei LPLD doch nicht um eine “Volkskrankheit” (was eigentlich ein Grund zum Feiern ist). Aber es zeigt mir, dass Gentherapien sich in Richtung Mainstream-Medizin bewegen, und bald auch für andere Krankheiten kommen werden.</p>
<p>Und wenn ich mir anschaue, wie stark z.B. die Kosten für Sequenzierung eines menschlichen Genoms in den letzten 10 Jahren gefallen sind (2004: ~$10 mio, 2014: ~$8.000), gehe ich davon aus, dass etwas Ähnliches auch bei Gentherapien passieren wird, sobald sie verbreiteter sind.</p>

Entwickelt vom Nobelpreisträger Eric Betzig vom Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Maryland (USA) eröffnet er ganz neue Möglichkeiten für Biologen und Biochemiker:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[Das neue Mikroskop ist]</em> präzise, schnell und vor allem nichtinvasiv genug, um viele Vorgänge einzufangen, die sich bislang der Beobachtung entziehen. “Es erlaubt dreidimensionale Aufnahmen bei so hohen Geschwindigkeiten, dass man dynamische Prozesse in Zellen als kontinuierliche Ereignisse sieht und nicht als einzelne Schnappschüsse”, erklärt Betzig.</p>

Dieses Gerät ist nicht nur interessant für Patienten mit Immundefekten, sondern auch z.B. im Einsatz gegen Tropenkrankheiten wie Malaria – und auch Ebola.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In dem Prozess werden superglatte magnetische Kügelchen mit einen Durchmesser von 128 Millionstel Millimeter mit Opsoninen beschichtet—einem Protein, das sich an Kohlenhydrate auf Bakterien bindet—und dem Blut außerhalb des Körpers beigemischt. Ein stärkerer Magnet zieht die Erreger mit den Nano-Magnetperlen wieder aus dem Blut heraus. Dieses Verfahren filtert außer Bakterien auch Pilze und sogar Viren direkt aus dem fließenden Blut, ohne den Krankheitserreger vorher identifizieren zu müssen. Das spart wertvolle Zeit auf der Intensivstation, die für die Suche nach einem geeigneten Antibiotikum verstreicht.</p>

Aber ihre Auswirkungen zeigen sich schon, zum Beispiel in der Gemeinde der Schachspieler:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The advent of AI didn’t diminish the performance of purely human chess players. Quite the opposite. Cheap, supersmart chess programs inspired more people than ever to play chess, at more tournaments than ever, and the players got better than ever. There are more than twice as many grand masters now as there were when Deep Blue first beat Kasparov. The top-ranked human chess player today, Magnus Carlsen, trained with AIs and has been deemed the most computer-like of all human chess players. He also has the highest human grand master rating of all time.</p>
<p>If AI can help humans become better chess players, it stands to reason that it can help us become better pilots, better doctors, better judges, better teachers.</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1A0qgNm"><strong>Machine Learning Reveals Genetic Control System</strong></a> — Ein kanadisches Forscherteam der Universität von Toronto geht mit Hilfe maschinellen Lernens der Frage nach, welche DNA-Mutationen Krankheiten hervorrufen. Einfach zusammengefasst: sie bringen einem Computer bei, mittels sog. <em>Deep Learning</em> in DNA-Daten nach versteckten und noch unbekannten Mutationen zu suchen, die Fehler beim “Zusammenbau” von Proteinen hervorrufen, und die damit Krankheiten wie Autismus, erbliche Krebsarten und spinale Muskelatrophie auslösen.</p>
<p>Und sie sind erfolgreich dabei, sagt die Pressemitteilung <a href="http://zukun.tf/1CC5kMa">der <em>U of T</em>, <em>“Machine learning reveals unexpected genetic roots of cancers, autism and other disorders”</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once they had taught their system how to read the text of the genome, Frey’s team used it to search for mutations that cause splicing to go wrong. They found that their method correctly predicted 94 per cent of the genetic culprits behind well-studied diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy and colorectal cancer, but more importantly, made accurate predictions for mutations that had never been seen before.</p>
<p>They then launched a huge effort to tackle a condition with complex genetic underpinnings: autism spectrum disorder.</p>
<p>And autism is just the beginning – this mutation indexing method is ready to be applied to any number of diseases, and even non-disease traits that differ between individuals.</p>

			 <p><strong>Arbeiten am und Warten auf den nächsten Schritt.</strong></p>
<p>Ich bin Transhumanist.  Ich bin davon überzeugt, dass wir uns in unserer Evolution an der Schwelle zu einer veränderten menschlichen Form befinden, dass der &ldquo;reine&rdquo; Mensch, also das, was wir jetzt dank natürlicher Auslese sind, nicht mehr lange in dieser Form existieren wird &ndash; und dass das nichts ist, vor dem man sich fürchten muss.  Diese Überzeugung basiert auf Vertrauen in unsere Spezies, ihre Vernunft, ihren Verstand, ihre Technologie und die Wissenschaft.  Ich glaube an die Evolution, und eine (langfristig) bessere Zukunft für die Menschheit.  Aber, und das ist ein Punkt, über den man vorzüglich diskutieren kann: ich unterscheide nicht zwischen sog. &ldquo;natürlicher&rdquo; Evolution und Technologie.</p>
<p>Einige meiner Bekannten bezeichnen mich als technikgläubig, aber ich persönlich finde den Begriff &ldquo;Technologie-enthusiastischer Humanist&rdquo; passender.  Technologie in sich beinhaltet kein Heilsversprechen, sie ist lediglich Mittel zum Zweck.  Und dieser Zweck ist die Weiterentwicklung und der Fortbestand unserer Art.</p>
<p>Ich sage: Landwirtschaft, Medizin, Straßenbau, Optik, Genforschung, Raumfahrt, Mathematik, Materialwissenschaften, Biotechnologie, Robotik etc. &ndash; <strong>all das sind wir</strong>.  Wir erfüllen seit je her unsere Rolle in der Evolution, indem wir sie nach und nach übernehmen.</p>
<p>Unsere entfernten Vorfahren, gerade aus den Bäumen gefallen und über die Savanne stolpernd, begannen irgendwann, ihre weitere Entwicklung in die eigenen Hände zu nehmen.  Sie entwickelten Werkzeuge für die Jagd, Kleidung und Hütten als Schutz gegen die Naturgewalten, formten das Land, um ihre Ernährung zu sichern, domestizierten andere Lebewesen, erfanden das Rad, gründeten Siedlungen, veranstalteten das Oktoberfest und besuchten den Mond.  <em>(Liste unvollständig.)</em>  Griffen sie damit in die natürliche Evolution ein, oder waren sie lediglich Teil derselben?  Und wenn all dies Teil der natürlichen Evolution ist &ndash; ist dann, was die Menschheit dieser Tage an Forschung und Entwicklung durchführt, nicht nur eine Fortführung dessen, was auch unsere Ahnen schon taten?</p>
<p>Ich glaube, die Technologien, die wir über die Jahrtausende hinweg entwickelt haben und noch entwickeln werden, die unser Leben, unser Wesen und unser Sein vereinfachen, verändern oder bereichern &ndash; sie sind ein integraler, durchaus natürlicher Baustein in dem großen Mosaik namens Mensch.  Sie sind untrennbar mit uns als organischen Lebewesen verbunden, denn ohne all unsere Kreationen wären wir nicht, wo wir heute sind, in allen positiven wie negativen Ausprägungen.</p>
<p>Wir sind, wo wir sind, weil wir unsere Umwelt und uns selbst eingehend erforscht und auch geformt haben.  All diejenigen unter uns, die ein &ldquo;Zurück zur Natur&rdquo; propagieren (was ich persönlich nicht ablehne!), würden sicher nur ungern auf z.B. ihre höhere Lebenserwartung (im Vergleich zum Jahr 1014), Zahnersatz, Brillen, Bücher und Penicillin verzichten.  All diese Dinge sind direkte Folgen unseres Seins, unserer Neugier, unseres Forschergeists.</p>
<p>Mein Glauben nährt sich aus diesem Wissen.  Wir lösen Probleme aus dem gleichen Grund, warum wir auch Berge besteigen: weil sie da sind.  Wir Homo Sapiens sind Entdecker, wir sind von Neugier getrieben und selten mit dem Status Quo zufrieden.  Wir schauen genau hin, gern auch zweimal.  Und unsere Wahrnehmung wird &ndash; dank technologischem Fortschritt &ndash; immer schärfer.  Wir schauen das an, was wir sind; wir schauen das an, was wir geschaffen haben.  Und nicht wenige unter uns fragen sich, ob diese scharfe Trennung tatsächlich bestehen bleiben muss.</p>
<p>Wir in unserer aktuellen Version sind nicht so einfach trennbar von unseren technischen Errungenschaften.  Unsere Siedlungen würden ohne Elektrizität oder Fahrzeuge kollabieren, viele Menschen wären ohne unsere medizinischen Entwicklungen nicht mehr am Leben oder zumindest gewaltig beeinträchtigt, unsere globalisierte Welt wäre ohne unsere Kommunikationswege nicht denkbar.  Wir wären nicht …wir.  Aber auch im Kleinen wäre vieles anders: denken wir nur mal an unser Handgehirn, pardon, das Smartphone, das so vieles für uns ist: Kommunikationsmittel, Nachschlagewerk, externalisiertes Gedächtnis, Musikplayer, Fitness-Helfer, Spielzeug, Kalender, etc.  Mein Smartphone ist ein externer Teil von mir &ndash; ich gebe zu, ich fühle mich etwas nackt, wenn ich es nicht bei mir habe, und da bin ich sicher nicht der Einzige.  Und diese Technologie existierte vor 10 Jahren so noch nicht, da brauchte man für all diese Facetten noch unterschiedliche Geräte, und die meisten davon waren (nach heutigem Verständnis) groß und klobig.  Was wir wohl im Jahr 2024 alles haben werden?</p>
<p>Mit dieser Frage im Hinterkopf blicke ich auf die Biotechnologie, ein Feld, in dem derzeit sehr viel sehr schnell passiert.  Mittlerweile können wir Gene punktgenau bearbeiten; wir erforschen das Hirn in nie dagewesener Tiefe; wir züchten Stammzellen aus Hautzellen, um alles Mögliche in unseren Körpern damit zu reparieren; wir beginnen, Organe und biologisches Gewebe in 3D-Druckern herzustellen; wir haben bionische Augen für Blinde und Exoskelette für Gelähmte entwickelt.  Sicher, vieles davon steckt noch in den Kinderschuhen, aber vieles davon war vor 20 Jahren auch noch reine Science Fiction.  Ich wäre nicht verwundert, wenn in 20 Jahren Millionen von Menschen mehr Technologie <em>im</em> als <em>am</em> Körper tragen würden.  Dabei denke ich nicht an Elektronik im herkömmlichen Sinn, sondern an bionische Sensoren und Systeme, die Teil unserer Körper sind, wie auch immer sie dann aussehen mögen; an gezielte Mutationen, um Krankheiten oder Unzulänglichkeiten zu begegnen; an Nanotechnologie, die uns z.B. längere Lebensspannen beschert.  Vieles davon wird zu Normalität werden, ohne wird man sich fühlen wie ohne Smartphone heute.  So abwegig das jetzt auch klingen mag: erwähnte ich schon, dass die Forschungsabteilung der US-Regierung (DARPA) aktiv an Neuroprothesen zur Unterstützung des Erinnerungsvermögens arbeitet?  Das passiert, jetzt gerade.</p>
<p>Die Menschheit entwickelt sich weiter.  In dem Moment, als der erste unserer haarigen Vorfahren ein Werkzeug benutzte, übernahmen wir eine aktive Rolle in der Evolution.  Wir waren und sind weiterhin stolz darauf, und sprechen von uns als &ldquo;Krone der Schöpfung&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Der Titel ist die reine Hybris, sicher.  Er kann und darf uns aber nicht dazu verleiten, auf der Stelle zu verharren.</p>

Und, wenn ich ehrlich bin: hin und wieder lässt mich auch die Inspiration im Stich, was ein Hinweis darauf ist, dass ich etwas auf die Bremse treten muss. <strong>Ich will den Newsletter aber nicht aufgeben</strong>, ganz sicher nicht. <strong>Aus diesem Grund wird NadZ in den nächsten Monaten unregelmäßiger erscheinen.</strong> Das heisst, vielleicht werden zwischen den einzelnen Ausgaben zwei Wochen vergehen, vielleicht drei, vielleicht aber auch fünf – ich weiss es noch nicht.</p>
<p>Das hat nichts mit Desinteresse meinerseits zu tun: <em>Neues aus der Zukunft</em> ist ein schönes Hobby für mich, an dem ich aber noch länger Spaß haben möchte. Ich hoffe, Ihr versteht das.</p>
<p><strong>Für meine treuen Patreon-Unterstützer</strong> ändert sich dadurch aber auch etwas. Ich werde vor Ablauf diesen Monats die Patreon-“Einheit” von <em>“pro Monat”</em> auf <em>“pro Ausgabe”</em> ändern. Das bedeutet, dass Patreon nur Unterstützung einsammeln wird, wenn tatsächlich etwas veröffentlicht wurde. <a href="http://www.patreon.com/neuesausderzukunft">Bitte passt Eure Pledges dementsprechend noch im Oktober an, danke!</a></p>

<h2 id="pew-pew-traktorstrahl">Pew, Pew, Traktorstrahl</h2>
<p>Mit Lasern kann man viele schöne Sachen machen. Katzen irritieren, Powerpoint-Präsentationen langweiliger machen, Haiköpfe verbessern, Schweinereien in Holzoberflächen brennen, Daten superschnell zwischen ISS und Bodenstation übertragen. Neueste Errungenschaft: ein optischer Traktorstrahl!</p>
<p>Ein Team der Australian National University in Canberra (Australien) begeisterte jetzt <em>Star Trek</em>-Nerds weltweit mit ihrer Meldung, einen Traktorstrahl aus Lasern entwickelt zu haben, der Objekte sowohl abstoßen als auch anziehen kann. Die Objekte in ihren Tests sind mit 0.2 mm Durchmesser noch recht klein, die Entfernung, die sie bewegt wurden, mit 20 cm noch recht gering, aber die Technik funktioniert.</p>
<p>Und zwar so: die Wissenschaftler bauten einen Laser, der einen “hohlen” Strahl erzeugt – der Laserbeam ist, einfach ausgedrückt, aufgebaut wie ein Rohr aus Licht. Im Inneren dieses Strahls fangen sie goldummantelte Glasteilchen ein, die beim Kontakt mit dem Laser dessen Energie aufnehmen. Die Energie sammelt sich dann auf der Oberfläche der Partikel, und wenn diese heissen Stellen mit Luftpartikel in Kontakt kommen, erhitzen sie sich und verpuffen, wodurch sie das Glasteilchen wegdrücken – es also bewegen. Durch Feinjustage des Lasers können bestimmte Stellen des Glaspartikels erhitzt werden, was eine Steuerung des Effekts zulässt.</p>
<p>Wie erwähnt war die Versuchsanordnung sehr klein, aber laut Ko-Autor der Studie, Dr. Vladlen Shvedov, lag das nur an den örtlichen Gegebenheit: <em>“Da Laser ihre Strahlqualität über lange Entfernungen beibehalten, könnte diese Technik über Meter hinweg funktionieren. Unser Labor war einfach nicht groß genug, um das zu demonstrieren.”</em> Ich war noch nie dort, aber das klingt, als wäre Australien winzig. Die armen Leute.</p>
<p>Wurscht. LASER!</p>

<p>Implantat mit Arm. Quelle: Max Ortiz-Catalan</p>
<p>Die Chalmers-Universität in Göteborg, Schweden, hat eine “Hirn-gesteuerte”, robotische Armprothese vorgestellt. Der Patient im Projekt ist ein LKW-Fahrer, der in den 2000ern seinen rechten Arm verloren hat, und dem vor über einem Jahr ein Titanimplantat am Oberarmknochen verankert wurde. Das Implantat beherbergt Elektroden für die Abtastung von Nerven- und Muskelsignalen, die bisher üblichen, auf der Haut verankerten Elektroden entfallen damit. Der Arm selbst kann vom Implantat getrennt werden (siehe Video in den Links).</p>
<p>Cool an dem Projekt ist, dass der Patient den Arm im letzten Jahr normal im täglichen Leben benutzt hat. Die neuromuskuläre Schnittstelle, die Teil des Implantats ist, erlaubt ein besseres Abgreifen der elektrischen Körpersignale, was bedeutet, dass die Prothese feiner gesteuert werden kann. Ein gesunder Mensch muss nicht groß darüber nachdenken, ob und wie er seinen Arm heben will – der Impuls ist da, der Arm geht hoch, die Hand greift zu, etc. Das ist auch das Ziel dieser Prothesen: die Elektroden greifen die Impulse des Körpers am Armstumpf auf, und setzen sie in mechanische Bewegungen des Arms um. Je besser die Abtastung, desto größer die Chance auf korrekte Bewegungen. Bei externen, also auf der Haut angebrachten Elektroden können Umwelteinflüsse wie elektromagnetische Felder oder auch Temperaturschwankungen die Kommunikation stören. Diese Mankos treten hier nicht auf.</p>
<p>Darüber hinaus besteht die Möglichkeit, die Kommunikation zwischen Arm und Körper auch zweiwegig zu machen – sensorische Informationen wie z.B. Druck könnten ans Hirn übermittelt werden. Die Schweden arbeiten daran, einen solchen Rückkanal in die Prothese zu integrieren. Und damit sind sie nicht die Einzigen: über ein solches Projekt hatte ich vor ein paar Monaten ja schon einmal berichtet (siehe Ausgabe #14, <em>“Handprothesen mit Gespür”</em>).</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-1">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Sicher, die Prothese ist noch etwas davon entfernt, wie das Original auszusehen oder so zuverlässig zu arbeiten. Aber die Verbindung mit dem Skelett über ein Titanimplantat und die bessere “Datenverbindung” sind schon saucool. Cyberpunk, wir kommen! ;)</p>

<h2 id="erstmals-totale-querschnittslähmung-geheilt">Erstmals totale Querschnittslähmung geheilt</h2>
<p>In einer bahnbrechenden Studie hat ein Mediziner-Team aus Polen und Großbritannien einen querschnittsgelähmten Mann mittels Zellen aus seiner Nase soweit geheilt, dass er wieder gehen kann.</p>
<p>Ich denke, ich sollte ich das näher erläutern.</p>
<p>Der Patient der Studie ist ein 38-jähriger Mann, dessen Wirbelsäule durch ein Gewaltverbrechen vor mehreren Jahren so schwer beschädigt wurde, dass er ab der Hüfte abwärts vollständig gelähmt war. Durch mehrere Messerstiche in den Rücken wurden seine Spinalnerven komplett durchtrennt. Keine Therapien konnten ihm helfen, die Lähmung blieb – leider üblich bei solch schweren Verletzungen.</p>
<p>Mediziner vom University College London (UK) und Wroclaw Medical University (Polen) beschlossen dann 2012, die große Lücke zwischen den durchtrennten Nervenenden mit körpereigenen Zellen zu überbrücken. Dazu entnahmen sie dem Mann aus seiner Nase sog. olfaktorische Mantelzellen. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Diese Zellen helfen der Reparatur von beschädigten Geruchsnerven, und das machen sie das ganze Leben hinweg so herausragend gut, dass sich die Forscher fragten, ob sie nicht vielleicht auch anderen Nerven auf die Sprünge helfen könnten.</p>
<p>Sie implantierten dem Patienten also diese Mantelzellen an den durchtrennten Nervenbahnen seiner Wirbelsäule, zusammen mit hauchdünnen Nervengewebe, das sie zuvor dem Knöchel des Patienten entnommen hatten. Mit dem Ersatz-Nervengewebe überbrückten sie die fehlenden 8 mm Rückenmark, die bei der Messerattacke entstanden war. Die Mantelzellen regten dann die Enden dieser Nervenfasern dazu an, wieder zu wachsen und sich mit dem restlichen Rückenmark zu verbinden. Und weil es seine eigenen Zellen waren, gab es keine Abstoßreaktionen, und sein Immunsystem musste auch nicht unterdrückt werden.</p>
<p>3 Monate nach der Operation bemerkte der Patient, dass sich an seinem linken Oberschenkel wieder Muskeln aufbauten; nach 6 Monaten unternahm er erste vorsichtige Schritte an einem Therapiegerät unter ärztlicher Aufsicht; jetzt, nach 2 Jahren, kann er mit einem Rollator wieder selbständig gehen. Irre!</p>
<p>Das klingt alles fantastisch, aber – wie so oft – weisen die Wissenschaftler darauf hin, dass das nur ein erster Schritt in die richtige Richtung ist, und sich ihr Erfolg nicht ohne Weiteres auf jeden anderen Patienten übertragen lässt. Ist klar, aber ein großartiger Erfolg ist es trotzdem.</p>
<p>Nach eigener Aussage möchte keiner der an der Studie Beteiligten finanzielle Vorteile aus dem Projekt ziehen (das heisst wohl, sie werden keine Firma gründen o.Ä.), stattdessen arbeiten sie jetzt mit Hochdruck an der Weiterentwicklung ihrer Behandlungsmethode, um sie praxistauglich zu machen. Hut ab!</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-2">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Ein Gelähmter kann wieder laufen, weil: Wissenschaft. ;) Dies ist das erste Mal, dass eine solch gravierende Verletzung geheilt werden konnte, dank der Selbstheilungskräfte des Körpers in Verbindung mit menschlicher Cleverness. Eine potente Mischung. Das ist sowohl bedeutend für den behandelten Patienten als auch die medizinische Gemeinschaft: <em>seht her, wir haben neue Türen aufgestoßen</em> – Querschnittslähmungen müssen nicht auf ewig unheilbar bleiben.</p>

<h2 id="fahrzeug-aus-dem-3d-drucker">Fahrzeug aus dem 3D-Drucker</h2>
<p>Der Local Motors &ldquo;Strati&rdquo;. Quelle: Local Motors</p>
<p>Mitte September wurde auf der Technologiemesse ITMS in Chicago ein 2-Sitzer-Fahrzeug vorgestellt, dessen Karosse, Sitze, Interior etc. komplett per 3D-Druck aus einem mit Kohlenstoff verstärkten Polymer namens Acrylnitril-Butadien-Styrol (ABS) hergestellt wurden. Elektromotor, Batterie, Reifen und eine Handvoll Kleinteile stammen aus herkömmlicher Fertigung.</p>
<p>Die US-Firma Local Motors hat das elektrisch betriebene Auto in jahrelanger Arbeit entwickelt, der eigentliche Druckprozess dauert nur 44 Stunden, die Endmontage des fertigen Flitzers nimmt einen weiteren Tag in Anspruch. Insgesamt besteht ihr “Strati”, so der Name, aus nur 49 Einzelteilen; ein handelsübliches Auto dagegen hat mehrere tausend Teile.</p>
<p>Und wer sich jetzt fragt, wie man sich das Drucken eines Fahrzeugs vorstellen muss, dem sei <a href="http://youtu.be/daioWlkH7ZI">dieses kurze Video empfohlen, das im Zeitraffer die Herstellung zeigt.</a></p>
<p>Noch hat das Gefährt keine Marktreife erlangt. Nichtsdestotrotz stehen die nächsten Schritte schon fest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Während Local Motors hofft, Strati in den kommenden Monaten reif für den Verkauf zu machen, setzt Cincinnati Inc. <em>[Anm. Carlo: der Hersteller des Druckers]</em> darauf, den Drucker zu vermarkten. Zwei Riesenprinter seien bereits verkauft worden, heißt es auf der amerikanischen populärwissenschaftlichen Website popsci.com. Ein Unternehmen wollte sie für Forschungszwecke und möchte mit ihnen Kunststoffgemische für den Druck testen.</p>
<p>Wenn es nach Cincinnati Inc. geht, schlagen demnächst auch Firmen zu, die Teile für Autos, Flugzeuge, Roboter und ähnliches damit herstellen wollen. Immerhin schaffe ein großer Drucker wie dieser Stücke, die rund zehnmal so groß sind wie die Ausdrucke derzeit gebräuchlicher Industrieprinter, heißt es.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Möchte ich persönlich ein Fahrzeug aus dem Drucker? Nein, ich glaube nicht, zumindest <em>noch</em> nicht. :) Aber der Strati ist so ein schönes Paradebeispiel für diese Technologie, daran konnte ich nicht vorbeigehen!</p>

<h2 id="mehr-kraft-in-der-hose">Mehr Kraft in der Hose</h2>
<p>Das Biodesign-Labor der Harvard Universität (USA) überraschte vor ein paar Tagen mit einer, äh, robotischen Hose. Das von ihnen entwickelte Exoskelett ist dafür gedacht, den Beinen des Trägers sozusagen unter die Arme zu greifen – es unterstützt die Beinmuskulatur mit robotischen Elementen, um z.B. das Tragen von schweren Lasten zu erleichtern. Dabei sieht es in der Tat ein wenig aus wie eine enganliegende Leggings (siehe Bild). Die Hose besteht aus “strukturierten funktionalen Textilien”, die mit eingebauten Sensoren den Gang des Trägers überwachen und ihm Hilfestellung geben, um Muskeln und Gelenke zu unterstützen und entlasten.</p>
<p>Exoskelette sind normalerweise größere Geräte, der “Bediener” steigt sozusagen in einen Harness, der meist vage an die menschliche Figur erinnert (oder an Teile davon). Das Skelett überwacht die Bewegung und verstärkt sie mit Hilfe von Motoren etc. Das bekannteste fiktionale Modell eines solchen Exoskeletts dürfte der supercoole <em>power loader</em> aus dem Film “Aliens” sein.</p>
<p>Das Harvard-System ist anders als bisherige Systeme, da es sich an den natürlichen Bewegungen von Muskeln und Sehnen orientiert, und diese emuliert. Es erinnert dabei nicht von ungefähr an lange Unterhosen, denn es ist tatsächlich für “unten drunter” konzipiert. Softe Sensoren in den Textilien überwachen die Bewegungen des Trägers, Batterie-betriebene Motoren ziehen über Kabel die Ferse oder am Bein nahe der Hüfte, um das Bein im richtigen Moment zu unterstützen – in der Art kann das Exoskelett dem Körper eine “Kraftreserve” von bis zu 20% geben.</p>
<p>Das Labor gibt als Zielgruppen sowohl Soldaten, Feuerwehrleute und auch Senioren an, also Menschen, die entweder beruflich schwere Rucksäcke oder Ausrüstung herumschleppen müssen, oder aber aus Alters- oder Krankheitsgründen Schwierigkeiten mit dem normalen Gehen haben. Die Batterien halten derzeit zwei bis vier Stunden durch, da aber auch die Batterietechnologie nicht stillsteht, dürfte sich diese Angabe bis zur Markteinführung noch etwas ändern.</p>
<p>Das Projekt wurde gerade von DARPA<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> mit $2,9 Mio Zuschuss bedacht, um die nächste(n) Version(en) des Prototypen zu finanzieren. Tests mit Soldaten, Schlaganfall-Patienten, Feuerwehrleuten und anderen Freiwilligen laufen bereits. Und die US-Sportartikelfirma New Balance hat eine Kollaboration mit dem Labor verkündet, was ich <em>sehr</em> interessant finde.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-1">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Das erste leichte, unterstützende Exoskelett, das man auch unter weiten Hosen tragen könnte, und was u.A. Senioren helfen kann, besser unterwegs zu sein. Und die Sportindustrie interessiert sich auch schon dafür… Daumen hoch!</p>

<h2 id="echtzeit-untertitel-für-gespräche">Echtzeit-Untertitel für Gespräche</h2>
<p>Das Georgia Institute of Technology (USA) hat eine App für Google Glass und Android-Smartphones entwickelt, die Untertitel für laufende Gespräche erzeugt. Sie ist gedacht für Menschen mit beeinträchtigtem Gehör, sie können damit in Echtzeit auf dem Glass-Display lesen, was ihr Gegenüber spricht. Die Idee dahinter ist, dass z.B. einer Schwerhörigen in Unterhaltungen geholfen wird – sollte ihr mal ein Wort durch die Lappen gehen, so kann sie mit einem kurzen Blick auf den Glass-Screen einfacher wieder in die Unterhaltung einsteigen, und möglicherweise auf das Nachfragen verzichten.</p>
<p>Der Gesprächspartner benutzt dabei das Smartphone als Mikrofon. Zwar hat Google’s Glass ein eingebautes Mikrofon, dieses ist aber auf seinen eigenen Träger fokussiert und so angelegt, dass es andere Stimmen ignoriert. Die Smartphone-App erkennt also das gesprochene Wort und nutzt das Glass-Display als Ausgabegerät.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-2">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Google Glass und derlei tragbare Geräte sind eine neue Form von Technologie, und die gesellschaftlichen, moralischen und auch technischen Auswirkungen sind noch nicht komplett klar. Und gerade Glass ist durchaus ein “Bananen-Produkt” im besten Sinne: es reift beim <em>Entwickler da draussen</em>. So, wie auch der Nutzen eines Smartphones durchaus mit den Apps steigt, die dafür verfügbar sind, und wie diese u.U. die weitere Entwicklung der Geräte beeinflussen, so wird auch die Evolution von Wearables wie Glass durch Tüftler getrieben, die eben nicht bei Google sitzen. Sicher, das ist jetzt keine vollkommen superfaszinierende Erfindung wie z.B. Haie mit Laser am Kopf, aber mich flashen manchmal auch die kleineren Fortschritte. :)</p>
<p>Und mir gefällt der Gedanke, dass uns später einmal, wenn wir mal (etwas) älter und (etwas) grauer sind, und unsere Sinne vielleicht ein wenig nachlassen, mehr Möglichkeiten zur Verfügung stehen, dem etwas entgegenzusetzen.</p>

<h2 id="us-kongress-berät-über-resourcen-förderung-an-asteroid">US-Kongress berät über Resourcen-Förderung an Asteroid</h2>
<p>Kein Scherz: Der US-Kongress diskutiert, ob Resourcen-Förderung an Asteroiden nach geltendem US-Recht überhaupt tragbar ist. Der internationale <em>“Vertrag über die Grundsätze zur Regelung der Tätigkeiten von Staaten bei der Erforschung und Nutzung des Weltraums einschließlich des Mondes und anderer Himmelskörper”</em> von 1967 verbietet nämlich nur Staaten, von Himmelskörpern (wie z.B. Planeten und Monde) Besitz zu ergreifen; als der Vertrag geschlossen wurde, konnte sich noch niemand vorstellen, dass eines Tages eine nicht-staatliche Raumfahrtindustrie existieren würde.</p>
<p>Die Frage ist nun, ob Firmen wie Planetary Resources<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, die in den USA registriert sind, überhaupt das Recht haben, auf Asteroid nach Rohstoffabbau zu betreiben. Diese Industrie steckt derzeit noch in den Kinderschuhen bzw. der Planungsphase, aber der Markt für derartige Dienstleistungen und Ressourcenbeschaffung dürfte in den nächsten Jahrzehnten mächtig wachsen, und Rechtssicherheit auf nationaler Ebene (und später auch auf internationaler) ist absolut notwendig für alle Firmen, die diese Industrie vorantreiben und sich in ihr bewegen.</p>
<p>Und nein, ich glaube nicht, dass die Praxis, die dieser Theorie folgen wird, noch viele Jahrzehnte entfernt ist.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-3">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Ist es nicht toll, dass sich jetzt schon die Politik mit solchen Themen beschäftigen muss? ;) Mir ist klar, dass das nicht automatisch bedeutet, dass dieser Markt schon erschlossen und aufgeteilt ist, aber die Vorstellung ist anscheinend nicht nur für mich greifbar genug, dass politische Debatten dazu angestossen werden.</p>

<h2 id="mit-großem-geld-gegen-das-altern">Mit großem Geld gegen das Altern</h2>
<p>California Life Company (kurz: Calico, auch bekannt als das Unternehmen, das von Google gegründet wurde, um den Kampf gegen das Altern aufzunehmen<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>) hat im September die Zusammenarbeit mit dem global agierenden BioPharma-Unternehmen AbbVie verkündet. Die Unternehmen wollen ihre Resourcen zusammenbringen, um gemeinsam neue Therapien für Patienten mit altersbedingten Leiden (wie u.A. neurodegenerative Krankheiten oder Krebs) zu finden, zu entwickeln und zu Marktreife zu bringen.</p>
<p>Sowohl AbbVie als auch Calico werden initial je $250 Mio in die Partnerschaft einbringen, mit Option auf weitere $500 Mio (pro Partner) zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt. Am Geld sollte es also nicht scheitern… Im Rahmen der Zusammenarbeit wird Calico eine Forschungs- und Entwicklungseinrichtung aufbauen, deren Fokus auf Wirkstoffforschung und -entwicklung liegen soll. AbbVie wird seinerseits wissenschaftliche und klinische Entwicklungshilfe geben, und helfen, die neuen Erfindungen am Markt zu etablieren.</p>
<p>In den letzten Monaten ging Calico mehrfach durch die Fachpresse, weil dort ein ziemlich beeindruckendes Team an Wissenschaftlern zusammengestellt wird, wie z.B. die Molekularbiologen Dr. Cynthia Kenyon (Fachgebiet: die Genetik des Alterungsprozesses) und Dr. Arthur Levinson (Zitat FAZ: <em>“Lichtgestalt in der Biotechnologieindustrie”</em>)</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-4">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Es geht vorwärts mit Calico, die meinen das ernst und nehmen richtig Geld in die Hand! Finde ich gut, zumal ich heute morgen festgestellt habe, dass ich immer noch altere, in der letzten Zeit sogar mehrmals täglich. Es wird Zeit, dass da mal jemand was tut.</p>

			 <p>Donnerstagmorgen sind dafür da, um <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> nochmal im Kino anzuschauen, und von einer Zukunft zu träumen, in der Raumschiffe und Waschbären mit Raketenwerfern normal sind. &lt;3</p>
<p>Heute habe ich fünf Meldungen über Hirnimplantate, kleine Soldaten, Autoimmunkrankheiten, künstliche Indäligents und Windkraft für Euch. Jedes dieser Themen liegt mir am Herzen, und ich teile gern. :)</p>
<p>Ich hätte gern mehr geschrieben (ein wiederkehrendes Thema, wie es scheint), aber wie immer war die freie Zeit zu knapp. Und es wird in den nächsten drei Wochen vermutlich noch etwas knapper, so dass ich die nächste Ausgabe erst in vier Wochen, also am 09.10., herausbringen kann. (Vielleicht sollte ich endlich mal darüber nachdenken, mir mit irgendjemandem die Arbeit zu teilen. Hmm.) Sorry.</p>
<p>Bis dahin freue ich mich über <a href="mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de">Eure Mails</a>, wenn es keine wüsten Beschimpfungen wegen der Pausen sind! :) Ich mag Feedback.</p>
<p>Bis zur nächsten Ausgabe,</p>

<h2 id="mehr-speicher-fürs-hirn">Mehr Speicher fürs Hirn</h2>
<p>Die US-Behörde DARPA<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> hat mehrere Labors und Forschungseinrichtungen damit beauftragt, in den nächsten vier Jahren die Geheimnisse des menschlichen Gedächtnisses zu knacken (im Sinne von <em>“Wie funktioniert das genau?”</em>), um <strong>Neuroprothesen zur Unterstützung des Erinnerungsvermögens</strong> zu entwickeln.</p>
<p>Damit gemeint sind Implantate, die einem verletzten Hirn helfen können, z.B. unterbrochene Brücken zu gespeicherten Erinnerungen wiederherzustellen, oder ihm gar zusätzliches Erinnerungsvermögen zur Verfügung zu stellen. DARPA denkt da in erster Linie natürlich an kriegsversehrte US-Soldaten, aber diese Forschung dürfte auch große Auswirkungen auf die zivile Medizin haben.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>In den letzten 14 Jahren erlitten allein 270.000 US-Soldaten traumatische Schädelverletzungen, die derartige Beeinträchtigungen nach sich gezogen haben – diese Veteranen würden von einer solchen Technologie profitieren.</p>
<p>Davon mal abgesehen: besseres Erinnerungsvermögen durch Implantate, holy crap! Und wer sich nach dieser meiner Aussage gerade langsam mit großen Augen vom Bildschirm entfernt: wie viele von uns schleppen tagtäglich ein Handgehirn mit sich rum? Viele unserer Erinnerungen, Todo-Listen, Mementos und Eindrücke sind auf unseren Smartphones gespeichert. Und ich glaube schon, dass der Gedanke, das Smartphone dafür nicht bemühen zu müssen, reizvoll ist. Oder?</p>

<h2 id="fliegende-windturbinen">Fliegende Windturbinen</h2>
<p>Die US-Firma Altaeros stellt Windturbinen her, die wie eine Mischung aus Schwimmreifen und Zeppelin anmuten: heliumgefüllte Ringe, in deren Mitte ein “Propeller” hängt. Wind strömt durch den Ring, der Propeller dreht sich, Strom wird erzeugt, und über ein Kabel an eine Bodenstation geleitet. Eine solche Altaeros-Turbine schwebt in Höhen von bis zu 750 m über ihrer kleinen Station, weiss Windgeschwindigkeiten bis zu 160 km/h zu verkraften, und kann genug Strom erzeugen, um eine Kleinstadt zu versorgen.</p>
<p>Diese mobilen Energieerzeuger sind für entlegene Gegenden gedacht, in denen keine stationären Turbinen aufgestellt werden können, oder auch für Krisengebiete oder Militärbasen. Das System benötigt im laufenden Betrieb kein Bodenpersonal, da es sich selbst die ergiebigste Flughöhe suchen kann und auch ansonsten autark arbeitet. Derzeit befindet es sich in einem kommerziellen Praxistest <del>am Arsch der Welt</del> in Alaska.</p>
<p>Die Erzeugung von sauberer, erneuerbarer Energie ist keine Option mehr – es ist eine Notwendigkeit, oder die Menschheit ist <em>fucked</em>. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Aber nicht überall ist Platz für entsprechende Anlagen. Solaranlagen benötigen viel freie Fläche. Stationäre Windturbinen z.B. sind riesengroß, müssen tief im Boden eingelassen werden (was nicht überall in der Form möglich ist), und das Aufstellen ist ein großer Aufwand. Das Altaeros-System dagegen passt in zwei Euro-Container, und die Installation geht schneller und einfacher vonstatten. Sicher, es erzeugt derzeit auch noch weniger Strom als ein normales Windrad, aber man kann dann ja vielleicht mehr als eins aufstellen.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-1">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Das Konzept der Dezentralisierung spricht mich an; gerade auch bei der Energieerzeugung. Dezentralisierte Systeme sind in der Regel ausfallsicherer, und wenn ein Ort oder eine Kommune sich unabhängig machen kann von großen Zulieferern, dann schadet das in der Regel nicht den Endverbrauchern. (In unserer Gegend z.B. gibts einige Biomasse- und Geothermie-Heizkraftwerke. Feine Sache, das.)</p>
<p>Was mich besonders anmacht bei dieser Art von Lösung: der Strom wird in der Luft gewonnen – die Bodenstation kann verhältnismäßig klein sein, denn der Erzeuger schwebt über den Dingen. Das ist nicht nur cool, es sieht auch total heiss aus. (Bis jemand versucht, mit dem Jetpack hindurch zu fliegen.)</p>

<h2 id="watsons-neue-jobs">Watson&rsquo;s neue Jobs</h2>
<p>Im Oktober letzten Jahres schrieb ich über Watson, IBMs Supercomputer, der mit natürlicher Sprache umgehen kann und Nadeln (i.e., nicht offensichtliche Informationen) in Heuhaufen (i.e., unsagbar großen Bergen von digitalen Dokumenten) finden kann. Watson hatte gerade sein neues Einsatzgebiet zugeteilt bekommen: die Krebsforschung.</p>
<p>Und der Zwischenstand ist vielversprechend! Unter Anderem hat Watson mehr als 70.000 wissenschaftliche Abhandlungen ausgewertet, die sich mit dem Protein p53 beschäftigen, das bei bestimmten Krebsarten als “Tumor-Unterdrücker” agiert, wenn es durch andere Proteine aktiviert werden kann. Die Forschung hat seit 2003 im Durchschnitt weniger als 1 dieser Aktivator-Proteine pro Jahr entdeckt. Als Test wurden Watson nun besagte Abhandlungen bis zum Jahr 2003 gefüttert, ohne Informationen darüber, was seit 2003 entdeckt wurde. Die Maschine las, interpretierte, korrelierte, und markierte innerhalb weniger Wochen 7 verschiedene Proteine als mögliche Kandidaten. Der Knüller daran? All diese Kandidaten (und lediglich 2 weitere) sind seit 2003 tatsächlich im Labor entdeckt und bestätigt worden. Watson hat also in kürzester Zeit den “richtigen Riecher” bewiesen.</p>
<p>Aber Watson wird in den letzten Monaten auch auf anderen Feldern eingesetzt: u.A.</p>
<ul>
<li>entwickelt er irrsinnige neue Rezepte aus Zutaten, die bisher vermutlich noch nie zusammen in einem Topf gelandet sind (ja, ich spreche wirklich über kreatives Kochen)</li>
<li>hilft er der Polizei von Tucson (USA) bei der Aufklärung der Entführung eines 6-jährigen Mädchens, in dem er in den zehntausenden Dokumenten, die mittlerweile in dem Fall zusammengekommen sind, nach Hinweisen und Verbindungen sucht, denen die Beamten dann nachgehen</li>
<li>kann er im Rahmen des <em>IBM Debating Technologies</em>-Projekt auf Zuruf Für- und Wider-Argumente zu beliebigen kontroversen Fragen konstruieren.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-2">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Wir (als Spezies) forschen und forschen und forschen. Der Berg an Informationen und Wissen, den wir anhäufen, wächst schnell und unaufhörlich, es ist nahezu unmöglich, den kompletten Überblick zu erlangen. Einer der texanischen Mediziner des Watson-p53-Projekts brachte es auf den Punkt: <em>“Selbst wenn ein Wissenschaftler 5 Abhandlungen pro Tag lesen würde, wären fast 38 Jahre vonnöten, um all die Forschung, die allein bis heute zu diesem Protein stattgefunden hätte, vollständig zu verstehen.”</em> Und das ist nur ein wissenschaftliches Projekt in einem einzelnen Forschungszweig, holy crap!</p>
<p>Aber: statt vor besagten Berg zu kapitulieren, erschaffen wir saucoole Technologie, die uns hilft, den Überblick zu behalten. Großartig!</p>

<h2 id="die-zukunft-der-verhütung">Die Zukunft der Verhütung</h2>
<p>Die Parsemus Foundation, eine gemeinnützige Organisation, deren Ziel es ist, kostengünstige medizinische Ansätze für diverse Probleme zu finden, verkündete Anfang des Monats, dass ihr hochgradig interessantes Vasalgel nächstes Jahr in die klinische Testphase gehen wird. <strong>Vasalgel ist ein Verhütungsmittel für die Herren</strong> – dieses nicht hormonelle Polymer-Hydrogel wird in den Samenleiter gespritzt, setzt sich an dessen Wänden ab, und “püriert” dort die kleinen Soldaten, wenn sie Richtung Front vorbeischwimmen. (Ahem.)</p>
<p>Eine einzelne Injektion wirkt ~10 Jahre lang und kann jederzeit rückgängig gemacht werden, indem eine zweite Injektion vorgenommen wird. Deren Wirkstoff löst das Hydrogel auf, so dass es auf natürlichem Wege ausgeschwemmt werden kann. Das macht Vasalgel zu einer fantastischen Alternative zu Vasektomien. Keine Verödungen mehr, Kollegen, niemand muss Angst haben! Großartige Sache.</p>
<p>Ein verwandtes Projekt in Indien namens RISUG wird seit mehreren Jahren an Freiwilligen getestet, mit großem Erfolg; Vasalgel wurde in den Staaten entwickelt, um westlichen Standards zu genügen, und jetzt über mehrere Monate ebenfalls erfolgreich an Pavianen ausprobiert. Tests an westlichen Patienten beginnen 2015, die Parsemus-Leute peilen eine Markteinführung im Jahr 2016/2017 an.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-3">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Ich habe vor ein paar Jahren einen sehr coolen Artikel auf WIRED darüber gelesen, und verfolge seither das Projekt durchaus aus Eigeninteresse. Ich halte ein Verhütungsmittel für Männer, das Hormonspritzen für die Damen nicht unähnlich ist, für überfällig — dahingehend, dass es eine zeitliche Begrenzung hat und reversibel ist. Ist doch super!</p>
<p>Ausserdem bin ich auf die gesellschaftlichen Auswirkungen neugierig, die eine Markteinführung mit sich bringen dürfte. Wenn Verhütungsmittel wie die Pille urplötzlich nicht mehr alleiniges Territorium der Frauen sind, sondern “Chancengleichheit” geschaffen wird. Wenn die Argumente <em>“Ich vertrage keine Kondome”</em> (sicher, sicher) oder <em>“Die Dinger sind mir alle zu klein”</em> (bwahahaha) nicht mehr automatisch bedeuten, dass Kerle komplett die Verantwortung abgeben dürfen.</p>

<h2 id="kampf-den-autoimmunkrankheiten">Kampf den Autoimmunkrankheiten!</h2>
<p>Die Universität von Bristol (USA) vermeldete in der letzten Woche, dass eines ihrer Teams einen Weg gefunden hat, Autoimmunerkrankungen <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> zu stoppen.</p>
<p>Sie fanden heraus, wie aggressive Zellen, die bei diesen Erkrankungen körpereigenes Gewebe angreifen, durch sog. Antigen-Immuntherapie effektiv in
“Verteidigerzellen” umgewandelt werden können. Das Ziel dabei ist es, dem Körper die “Toleranz” gegenüber seinem eigenen Gewebe zurückzugeben, ohne (wie bei herkömmlichen Methoden) das Immunsystem zu schwächen. Das Interessante daran: es handelt sich, streng genommen, nicht um eine Heilung, denn die Krankheit wird nur dauerhaft “deaktiviert” – sie ruht!</p>
<p>Die Studie aus Bristol bezieht sich auf Mäuse, das Projekt ist aber auf dem Weg in die klinischen Testphase. Verhalten ermutigende Nachrichten also für Menschen mit multipler Sklerose, Hashimoto-Thyreoiditis, Diabetes Typ 1 etc.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-4">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Ich finde den Ansatz interessant: das Verfahren ist der Hyposensibilisierung bei Allergien nicht unähnlich. Dem Immunsystem wird beigebracht, bestimmte körpereigene Proteine nicht weiter zu attackieren.</p>
<p>Wie so oft steckt aber auch dieser neue Weg noch in den Kinderschuhen, klar. Mehr Forschung ist nötig, aber die grundsätzliche Herangehensweise ist neu und vielversprechend.</p>

			 <p>Donnerstagmorgen sind dafür da, um sich zu fragen, ob das neue Format, was sich Carlo da für den Newsletter ausgedacht hat, gut ist oder nicht. Hmm!</p>
<p>Diese Ausgabe ist etwas anders zusammengestellt. Zwei der Gründe dafür sind “Zeitmangel” sowie “das Leben” – die Themen, die ich zusammengetragen habe, konnte ich nicht so ausführlich behandeln, wie ich mir eigentlich gewünscht hatte. Und so habe ich die kürzeren Meldungen thematisch in Blöcken zusammengefasst; als ich damit fertig war, gefiel mir die Aufteilung ganz gut. <a href="mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de">Was meint Ihr?</a></p>
<p>Wenn man es genau betrachtet, ist diese neue Zusammenstellung einfach nur hochgradig innovativ!!1 Leider kam sie zu spät, und so habe ich es nicht mehr in <a href="http://zukun.tf/1lfxOqv">die diesjährige Liste <em>“35 Innovators Under 35”</em> des MIT Technology Review</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> geschafft. Nichtsdestotrotz ist sie auch 2014 ein interessanter Einblick in aktuelle Forschungen in Biologie, virtueller Realität, Umwelttechnologie, Web, Hirnforschung, Musik &amp; Kunst, Gesundheit, Robotik etc. Wirklich lesenswert, und die Lektüre hat wie immer das Potential, dieses wohlige <em>“Ich verschwende meine Jugend, rah!”</em>-Gefühl zu erzeugen.</p>

<h2 id="ein-step-zurück-zwei-schritte-vorwärts">Ein STEP zurück, zwei Schritte vorwärts</h2>
<p>Forscher der Yale School of Medicine (USA) haben in jahrelanger Arbeit eine Medikamentenverbindung entwickelt, die in Mäusen die Auswirkungen von Alzheimer rückgängig macht.</p>
<p>Die Verbindung unterbindet die negativen Effekte eines Proteins namens STEP ( <em>“STtriatal-Enriched tyrosine Phosphatase”</em>), das, wenn es in größeren Mengen im Hirn vorkommt, Synapsen davon abhält, stärker zu werden. Das Problem: Synapsen müssen sich verfestigen, damit z.B. Erinnerungen nicht nur kurzzeitig, sondern längerfristig gespeichert werden können.</p>
<p>Die Wissenschaftler stellten nun fest, dass bei einigen Erkrankungen (wie u.A. der Alzheimer-Krankheit) die STEP-Level im Gehirn erhöht sind. Ursache/Wirkung? Sie entwickelten die Theorie, dass sich die kognitiven Fähigkeiten des Erkrankten möglicherweise wieder normalisieren würden, wenn der STEP-Level künstlich gesenkt werden kann, und die Synapsen nicht länger zurückgehalten werden. Sie untersuchten also tausende Moleküle, von denen sie vermuteten, dass sie das STEP-Protein “ausbremsen” können. Die erfolgreichsten Kandidaten wurden an erkrankten Mäusen getestet, und die Vermutung erwies sich als korrekt: die mit der Verbindung behandelten Mäuse wiesen nach kurzer Zeit wieder das gleichen geistige Vermögen auf wie die gesunde Kontrollgruppe. Whoa!</p>
<p>Mehr Forschung ist nötig, damit diese Ergebnisse am Ende menschlichen Patienten zugute kommen können. Das Team hat die Tests ausgedehnt, ihre Arbeit geht weiter.</p>

Da ging es um ein Protein, das im Blut junger Mäuse (und Menschen) vorkommt, aber so gut wie gar nicht mehr im Blut ihrer alten Artgenossen. Durch Bluttransfusionen wurden alte Mäuse mit jenem Protein versorgt — und ihre Muskeln, Herzen und auch Hirne wurden wieder jugendlich. Faszinierende Geschichte, damals gingen die beteiligten Mediziner von klinischen Tests an Menschen in den nächsten 3 bis 5 Jahren aus. Nun, dies wird jetzt schon dieses Jahr im Oktober an der Stanford School of Medicine passieren: freiwillige, ältere Alzheimer-Patienten werden dort Blutplasma von gesunden Menschen unter 30 erhalten.</p>
<p>Die Wissenschaftler wollen so herausfinden, ob sich die ermutigenden Ergebnisse der Mäuse auch in Menschen wiederholen lassen, und sich die kognitiven Fähigkeiten der Patienten verbessern werden. Man darf gespannt sein!</p>

<h2 id="materialien--energie">Materialien &amp; Energie</h2>
<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1opr4BB"><strong>Komplett durchsichtige Solarzellen</strong></a> – Ein Team von Forschern an der Michigan State University (USA) hat eine neue Form von Solarkonzentrator erfunden: ihr plastikartiges Material ist <em>komplett</em> transparent, und damit theoretisch auch in Fenstern einsetzbar. Oder in Smartphones, oder anderen Geräten, die Screens besitzen. Das Material macht sich winzige organische Moleküle zunutze, die für Menschen unsichtbare Wellenlängen von Licht (z.B. im UV- und nahen Infrarotbereich) absorbieren, diese an dünne Streifen von photovoltaischen Zellen abgeben, die auf den Kanten des Plastiks sitzen, wo sie dann in Elektrizität umgewandelt werden.</p>
<p>Die Michigan…isten (?) weisen vor allen Dingen auf das kommerzielle und industrielle Potential ihres neuen Materials hin – ihre Prototypen sind zwar noch recht jung, aber alles deutet darauf hin, dass das Zeug recht einfach und kostengünstig im großen Stil hergestellt werden kann, und sich z.B. dafür eignet, in Bürohäusern und Wolkenkratzern eingesetzt zu werden, deren Fassaden ohnehin ja meistens fast nur aus Glas bestehen.</p>
<p>Das Konzept dieser Technologie ist zwar nicht ganz neu, allerdings waren bisherige Konkurrenzmodelle immer farbig, und wer möchte schon den ganzen Tag aus einem gefärbten Fenster schauen…</p>
<p>Die Effizienz des Materials liegt derzeit noch bei 1%, angestrebt sind aber 5% und mehr. Das mag nicht viel erscheinen, aber das ist immerhin schon wesentlich mehr als ein herkömmliches Fenster. ;)</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1wybc9Y"><strong>Solarzellen aus der Sprühdose</strong></a> – An der University of Sheffield (UK) wurde eine neue, kostengünstige Art von Solarzellen entwickelt, die auf jeden Untergrund aufgesprüht (!) werden kann, und durchaus das Zeug hat, den Preis für Solarstrom in den Keller zu drücken. Die neuen Zellen basieren auf dem neuen “Wundermaterial” Perovskit, weisen derzeit eine Effizienz von 19% auf, werden ähnlich wie Autolack auf einen Träger aufgetragen, und sind unglaublich günstig.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.skullysystems.com/"><strong>Smarter Motorradhelm</strong></a> – Der Skully AR-1 ist eine superinteressante Kopfbedeckung für Mopedfahrer: der Helm verfügt sowohl über einen Computer als auch ein Visir, das abdunkeln kann und u.A. anzeigt, was hinter dem Fahrer passiert (gespeist von einer integrierten 180°-Kamera). Dazu kommen eingebaute GPS-Navigation, Bluetooth, ein HUD (Head-up-Display) für Informationen wie Geschwindigkeit oder Tankfüllstand etc. Das Ding erinnert mich irgendwie an die smarten Helme der Mechpiloten in Animes und Videospielen. :) Saucool, kann beim Hersteller vorbestellt werden.</p>

<p><a href="http://zukun.tf/1lfCAV6"><strong>10 Gründe, warum Dronen-Technologie störend ( <em>“disruptive”</em>) ist</strong></a> – Peter Diamandis, Luftfahrtingenieur und Visionär, erklärt (auf Englisch), warum Drohnen super sind, und denkt laut darüber nach, dass wir seiner Meinung nach eigentlich noch <em>gar nichts</em> gesehen haben. Die nächsten 10-20 Jahre auf diesem Gebiet werden noch viel cooler und wilder – dank leistungsfähigerer Hardware (Miniaturisierung, Akkus, leichtere Materialien, Antriebe, etc.) und Software (AI!).</p>
<p>Da werden sich Möglichkeiten auftun, von denen wir im Augenblick höchstens träumen können: in der Medizin, der Landwirtschaft, der Raumfahrt, dem Katastrophenschutz (Feuerwehr, Sanitäter), der persönlichen Sicherheit, Kunst &amp; Kultur, der Energiewirtschaft… (Und ja, auch beim Militär, wie bei jeder Technologie.

<h2 id="mehr-spaß-beim-aderlass">Mehr Spaß beim Aderlass</h2>
<p>Niemand mag Bluttests. Der Hausarzt entnimmt Blut, das zu einem Labor geschickt wird, in dem ein paar teure Tests ausgeführt werden, und ein paar Tage später erklärt der Arzt dem Patienten, was das Problem ist, und/oder ordnet weitere Tests an — neue Blutentnahme, etc.</p>
<p>Die US-Firma Theranos hat über die letzten zehn Jahre ein Blutlabor-System entwickelt, das ungefähr 70 verschiedene Tests automatisiert mit einer winzigen Menge Blut (ein bis zwei Tropfen = ~50 µl = 0.05 ml) ausführen kann. Diese Anzahl von Tests durchzuführen würde mit herkömmlichen Methoden <em>mehrere</em> der bekannten, großvolumigeren Blutproben benötigen, jede davon um die 4 ml.</p>
<p><strong>Theranos’ Laborsystem ist vollautomatisiert</strong>, um menschliche Fehler weitgehend ausschliessen zu können — und um <strong>50-90% günstiger als Konkurrenzprodukte</strong> (auf dem US-Markt), was auch Krankenversicherungen und Ärzte freuen dürfte. Bluttests sind nämlich nicht wirklich billig, was einer der Gründe für die eingangs beschriebenen langwierigen Testläufe ist. Eine Ärztin beschränkt die Anzahl der gemachten Bluttests nämlich nicht immer nur deshalb, weil sie sich sicher ist, was die untersuchten Beschwerden auslöst, sondern oft auch aus Kostengründen. Manchmal wäre es hilfreich, mit einem Schlag 10-20 unterschiedliche Tests überprüfen zu lassen, aber das zahlt keine Kasse ohne Murren. Tja. Und schneller ist Theranos’ System auch, <strong>oft liegen die Ergebnisse schon innerhalb weniger Stunden vor</strong>.</p>
<p>Sehr interessant finde ich den infrastrukturellen Ansatz, den Theranos verfolgt: statt überall eigene Standorte zu eröffnen, hat die Firma hat einen Vertrag mit Walgreens abgeschlossen, einer US-Drogerie-Kette, die ohnehin schon das ganze Land abdeckt. Und so kann man derzeit Bluttests in schon ca. 30 Walgreens in Kalifornien und Arizona durchführen lassen, in denen Theranos sog. “Wellness Centers” eingerichtet hat. Weitere Standorte sind in Arbeit, das “Fernziel” der Firma ist es, Test-Center im Umkreis von 5 Meilen jedes US-Haushalts einzurichten.</p>

<p>Technologie krempelt den Gesundheitssektor um. Je mehr Daten einem Mediziner zu seinem Patienten zur Verfügung stehen, gerade bei desto besser. Und gerade dann, wenn akute Beschwerden vorliegen (was meistens der Fall ist, wenn man endlich mal zum Arzt geht), ist es wichtig, schnell an die relevanten Informationen zu kommen, und dazu gehören auch die Blutwerte.</p>
<p>Und die <em>Quantified Self</em>-Freunde<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> wird’s freuen, problemlos und günstig an noch mehr Daten zu kommen, auch ohne Arzt, der dabei behilflich ist.</p>

<h2 id="kontaktlinsen-update">Kontaktlinsen-Update</h2>
<p>Im Januar hatte ich über Google[x]’ Prototypen einer smarten Kontaktlinse geschrieben, die die Blutzuckerwerte ihres Trägers überwacht, in dem sie die Tränenflüssigkeit analysiert. (Siehe NadZ #13, <em>“Blutzuckermessung durch Kontaktlinsen”</em>). Das ist jetzt mehr als ein halbes Jahr her — was hat sich in der Zwischenzeit auf diesem Feld getan? Schauen wir mal…</p>
<p>Ende Juli verkündeten Google[x] und das Schweizer Pharmaunternehmen Novartis International AG, sich ab jetzt gemeinsam dem Feld der intelligenten “Multifunktionslinsen” widmen zu wollen. Zusammen arbeiten sie jetzt an Linsen, die sowohl Blutzucker messen als auch einem fernsichtigen Auge beim Fokussieren im Nahbereich helfen können. (Novartis, ein großer Hersteller von Kontaktlinsen, versucht seit Jahren, Glukose-Messung in Linsen unterzubringen, bisher allerdings erfolglos; aus diesem Grund lizensiert die Firma jetzt Google’s Technologie.) Franck Leveiller, Chef der Forschungs- und Entwicklungsabteilung von Novartis’ Augenpflege-Division, sagte es so: <em>“Es ist an der Zeit, einen kleinen Computer und eine Menge miniaturisierte Technik in Kontaktlinsen zu packen.”</em></p>
<p>Ich denke, dass er mit dieser Einschätzung Recht hat, allein schon deshalb, weil Tränenflüssigkeit mehr als nur die Messung von Glukose zulässt — sie enthält u.A. auch…</p>
<ul>
<li>eine Chemikalie namens Lacryglobin, einen Biomarker für diverse Krebsarten (Brust-, Lungen-, Gebärmutter-, Prostata- und Darmkrebs)</li>
<li>Milchsäure, die bei erhöhtem Vorkommen auf drohendes Herzversagen, Leber- oder Lungenkrankheiten hinweisen kann.</li>
</ul>
<p>Und Novartis und Google[x] sind nicht die einzigen Spieler auf diesem Feld. Eine kleine Auswahl:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forscher an der Universität von Michigan, USA, haben Graphen-basierte, wirklich hauchdünne Rezeptoren für ultraviolettes und infrarotes Licht entwickelt, und darauf hingewiesen, dass sich ihre Technologie für den Einsatz in Kontaktlinsen geradezu anbietet. Einmal Nacht- und Wärmebildsicht, bitte!</li>
<li>Das Schweizer Unternehmen Sensimed hat Linsen entwickelt, die kontinuierlich den Augeninnendruck ihres Trägers messen, und dadurch Augenärzten eine bessere Früherkennung des Grünen Star erlauben.</li>
<li>Die Firma Innovega aus den USA stellt ein System von <em>Augmented Reality</em>-Kontaktlinsen<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> namens “iOptik” her.</li>

<p>Passive Gesundheitsvorsorge durch passives Überwachen des eigenen Körpers? Was kann man daran nicht toll finden? Alles Weitere (UV-/IR-Sicht, Augmented Reality, <a href="http://zukun.tf/1o8jj6T">LASERSTRAHLEN PEW PEW</a> etc.) ist das saucoole Sahnehäubchen.</p>

<h2 id="mit-der-mikrowelle-in-den-weltraum">Mit der Mikrowelle in den Weltraum</h2>
<p>Seit ein paar Jahren gibt es ein paar Konzepte und Projekte zu neuen Antriebsformen für Raumschiffe, die nicht auf dem Verbrennen von Treibstoffen basieren. Nicht wenige davon sind etwas esoterisch, weil sie Effekte beschreiben, die mit dem heutigen Wissensstand nicht wirklich zufriedenstellend erklärbar sind. Da wären u.A. das britische EmDrive sowie das chinesische EmDrive (thematisch verwandt, ansonsten unabhängig), die das Generieren von Schubkraft durch elektrisch erzeugte Mikrowellen beschreiben. Ein solches Triebwerk hätte den Vorteil, dass man keine Unmengen von Treibstoff braucht, um durchs All zu düsen, sondern lediglich einen kleinen Reaktor. Das wäre praktisch!</p>
<p>Bisher wurden diese Ansätze immer spöttisch belächelt, im besten Fall kritisch beäugt – bis sich jetzt allerdings die gute alte NASA der Technologie annahm, selbst Experimente durchführte und eine erste Studie dazu veröffentlichte, die durchaus positiv klingt. Der Ansatz wurde nicht verteufelt, sondern wissenschaftlich untersucht, in Experimenten überprüft, und überraschenderweise nicht umgehend als Humbug entlarvt, im Gegenteil: die von den EmDrive-Leuten beschriebenen Effekte konnten gemessen und nachgewiesen werden, auch wenn noch niemand genau sagen kann, <em>warum</em>.</p>
<p>Wired UK veröffentlichte daraufhin einen Artikel zur NASA-Veröffentlichung, der zu langen, teils euphorischen Diskussionen in diesem Internetz führte. Bald gibts Hoverboards, Jetpacks und Warpantriebe für alle, hurra! Party!</p>
<p>Das rief dann einige kluge Menschen auf den Plan, die die Story auseinandernahmen und erklärten, warum die besprochene Technologie komplett unmöglich sei, so z.B. Discover Magazine und der Physiker John Baez. Die Ergebnisse wurden (grob zusammengefasst) mit Toleranzen und Fehlern im Versuchsaufbau erklärt. Verdammt, die Hoverboard-Party wird abgesagt‽ Schade. :(</p>
<p>Das wiederum brachte Wired dazu, eine Woche später ein Follow-Up nachzulegen, in dem die 10 wichtigsten Fragen zum Artikel und der Studie näher erläutert wurden. Und das Internet diskutiert weiter und wieder – und wir warten gespannt auf weitere Experimente und Tests.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-2">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Das Universum erfüllt mich mich Ehrfurcht und Begeisterung – es ist wundervoll und wahnsinnig komplex! Und ja, ich gebe zu, diese “EmDrives” klingen esoterisch. Aber!</p>
<p>Ein mir sehr wichtiger und spiritueller Mensch sagte mir einmal, dass es viele Dinge gäbe, die wir nicht verstehen. Für sie ist das ein möglicher Hinweis auf ein höheres Wesen, eine höhere Macht – auf Magie, in gewisser Weise. Fair enough; dies ist vermutlich der Ursprung der meisten Religionen: Esoterik (und dies sage ich ohne Wertung).</p>
<p>Ich dagegen bin Polyatheist<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> und komme zu einem etwas anderen Schluss, wenn ich die gleichen Fakten betrachte: mir wird wieder klar, dass es in der Tat viele Dinge gibt, die wir nicht verstehen – <strong>noch</strong> nicht. All das, was uns in den vergangenen Jahrhunderten unerklärlich vorkam, vor dem sich unsere Vorfahren in den Sand warfen, haben wir irgendwann erforscht, um es zu verstehen, und das fast immer erfolgreich. Die Mysterien verfliegen, aber die Ehrfurcht bleibt. Und unsere Instrumente werden besser, unser Blick schärfer, unser Gehör feiner: da ist so Vieles, das es noch zu entdecken gilt. Warum sollte dazu nicht auch eine physikalische Erklärung gehören, warum EmDrives eventuell doch funktionieren? :)</p>
<p>Alles ist offen, und ich finds großartig!</p>

<h2 id="deflektorschilde-hochfahren">&ldquo;Deflektorschilde hochfahren!&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Anfang Juni veröffentlichte ein Team um Ruth Bamford am Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Großbritannien eine Studie, in der sie — ganz einfach zusammengefasst — den theoretischen Aufbau eines Deflektorschild für Raumfahrzeuge vorstellten, der Astronauten vor schädlicher Strahlung schützt.</p>
<p>Sobald Menschen die Erde verlassen, sind sie nicht mehr durch der Erde starkes Magnetfeld geschützt, und bekommen all die “guten Sachen” direkt ins Gesicht, die uns hier auf der Erde nicht erreichen. Das kann in großen Dosen potentiell tödlich enden, da die hochenergetischen Teilchen der kosmische Strahlung hochgradig schädlich für den menschlichen Körper sind, und u.A. Mutationen auslösen können. Das stellt gerade bei längeren Aufenthalten im All, wie z.B. Missionen zum Mars, ein Problem dar.</p>
<p>Die britischen Forscher haben Daten von auf dem Mond natürlich vorkommenden Magnetosphären eingehend analysiert, und das Rätsel knacken können, wie diese sehr schwachen Magnetfelder Teile des Mondes vor Strahlung schützen können. ( <em>“Sehr schwach”</em> in diesem Kontext bedeutet: ca. 0.25% der Stärke des Erdmagnetfeldes.) Aus ihren Berechnungen und Beobachtungen abgeleitet konnten sie dann eine künstliche Mini-Magnetosphäre beschreiben, und auch, wie ein Generator dafür aussehen würde, den man z.B. an ein Raumschiff binden könnte. In ihren Simulationen zeigten sie auf, wie relativ wenig Energie für den Betrieb eines solchen Generators notwendig wäre (~21 kW). Das Gerät hebt sich damit deutlich von den bisherigen theoretischen Strahlenschutz-Modellen ab, die von weitaus stärkeren Magnetfeldern ausgehen, und dementsprechend fantastisch hohe Energieanforderungen haben.</p>
<p>Also: ein weiteres Mosaiksteinchen für kommende Mars-Missionen ist gefunden und eingepasst! Noch nicht ganz: Frau Bamford und ihre Kollegen beeilen sich, darauf hinzuweisen, dass in ihren Modellen noch einige Komplexitäten und Details warten, die näher untersucht werden müssen. <em>Fair enough.</em></p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Hier gehts um wichtige Arbeit, schließlich haben die Raumfahrtorganisationen der Welt fest viele Orte jenseits des nahen Erdorbits im Blick: Mars, Asteroiden, die Jupitermonde… Nur dürfte es schwer werden, Freiwillige zu finden, wenn vor der Reise schon klar ist, dass alle Astronauten aufgrund von Strahlenschäden umkommen werden.</p>

<h2 id="herox-crowdfunding-für-die-menschheit">HeroX: Crowdfunding für die Menschheit</h2>
<p>Kickstarter und Indiegogo helfen seit Jahren kleinen Teams, ihre Visionen zu verwirklichen. Ein Team stellt seine Idee vor, präsentiert sich und seinen Aktionsplan, und versucht, andere Menschen dafür zu begeistern, damit diese sein Projekt finanziell unterstützen.</p>
<p>Die gemeinnützige XPRIZE Foundation <em>“schreibt Preise für technische und wissenschaftliche Entwicklungen aus, die hauptsächlich privat finanziert sind. Nach eigenen Angaben will sie damit Anreize für den Aufbau von Industrien und neue Jobs schaffen, sowie die derzeit festgefahrenen Märkte wiederbeleben. Als höheres Ziel sollen die Preise mit ‘radikalen Durchbrüchen’ dem Wohl der Menschheit dienen.”</em> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Das macht sie seit mehreren Jahren, und ihre Projekte umfassen u.A. die <em>Oil Cleanup X-Challenge</em> (ausgerufen nach dem kriminellen BP-Ölpest-Clusterfuck 2010) und den <em>Ansari X-Prize</em> (aus dem große Teile der NewSpace-Industrie hervorgegangen sind, vergeben 2004).</p>
<p><strong>Aber was passiert, wenn man diese zwei Konzepte — Crowdfunding und das Verbessern der Welt — kombiniert?</strong></p>
<p>Das versuchen die XPRIZE-Leute jetzt mit ihrere neuen Plattform <em>HeroX</em> herauszufinden. Jeder Mensch kann sog. Herausforderungen (Challenges) aufstellen, z.B. <em>“Finde eine kostengünstige Möglichkeit, arme und entlegene Gebiete sauber mit Strom zu versorgen”</em>. Oder <em>“Wir brauchen essbare Wasserflaschen”</em>. Oder <em>“Reduziere Staus in der San Francisco Bay Area um 10%”</em>. Oder <em>“Wir müssen ein Generationenschiff nach Alpha Centauri schicken”</em>. Keine Idee ist zu verwegen oder zu wild!</p>
<p>Sagen wir, Du hast eine Idee, wie man die Welt verbessern kann. Wenn Du die auf der Website eingestellt hast, fängt die Crowdfunding-Phase an. Du versuchst, andere Leute für die Idee zu begeistern, und die steigen mit ein, und geben Geld dafür. Zusammen ergeben diese Spenden dann das Preisgeld, das Erfinder einstreichen können, wenn sie sich mit ihrer (potentiellen) Lösung der Herausforderung gestellt und gegen ihre “Konkurrenz” behauptet haben. Mit dem Preisgeld kann das Projekt dann weiter verfolgt werden.</p>
<p>HeroX ist ein Werkzeug, das Leute weltweit zusammenbringen kann, um gemeinsam die Menschheit voranzubringen, im Großen wie im Kleinen. Sie wissen vielleicht nicht, welche Probleme die Menschen in Südamerika oder Afrika umtreiben — aber u.U. haben ja Beppi in Schwabing oder Anders in Södermalm oder Nishiko in Shinagawa die passende Lösung dafür. Oder umgedreht!</p>
<p>Brillantes Konzept.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-1">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Crowdfunding funktioniert, das haben Kickstarter &amp; Co. gezeigt. Aber an dem Punkt, an dem ein Projekt auf KS beginnt, ist schon viel Vorarbeit geleistet worden. Die Leute mit dem Projekt haben ein Problem identifiziert, <strong>dann</strong> haben sie eine theoretische Lösung dafür entwickelt, <strong>dann</strong> entschieden sie sich dafür, es selbst zu verwirklichen, <strong>dann</strong> entwickelten sie evtl. schon einen Prototypen, <strong>dann</strong> haben sich bei KS beworben und <strong>dann</strong> sind sie akzeptiert worden. Das sind recht viele “dann”!</p>
<p>Das, was HeroX macht, ist das Crowdsourcing auch dieser einzelnen Schritte. Die Idee, die “Macht des Schwarms” auf so unterschiedlichen Ebenen in einer Plattform zu vereinen, ist für mich unglaublich inspirierend. Ich kann nicht absehen, ob es funktionieren wird, aber ich hoffe es sehr!</p>

			 <p>Donnerstagmorgen sind dafür da, um langsam mal den Sonnenschutz rauszuholen und sich auf den Urlaub vorzubereiten.</p>
<p>In den letzten zwei Wochen wurde ich einige Male gefragt, ob ich <em>wirklich</em> an die <a href="https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues/1-ausgabe-1">These des sich beschleunigenden Wandels</a> glaube, und ob das nicht eigentlich nur Unsinn ist?</p>
<p>Die kurze Antwort: ja, das tue ich, und nein, ist es nicht.</p>
<p>Die lange Antwort ist ein kleiner exemplarischer Geschichtsexkurs.</p>
<p><strong>Als ich vor 40 Jahren auf die Welt kam, 1974</strong>, da ist Telefonieren irgendwie noch der heisse Scheiss — die Geräte haben sich zwar in den letzten Jahrzehnten kaum verändert, aber vor Kurzem wurde <em>die Direktwahl (!) bei Telefongesprächen</em> zwischen (West-)Europa und den USA eingeführt, und im gesamten Ostblock existieren angeblich schon nahezu 3 Dutzend Telefone! Fortschritt! Menschen schreiben sich Briefe, per Hand, die tagelang unterwegs sind.</p>
<p><strong>Vor 30 Jahren, 1984</strong>, sind Telefone auch in der damaligen DDR <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> schon etwas weiter verbreitet, und im August läuft an der Universität Karlsruhe nach 2-jähriger Vorarbeit die erste für Deutschland bestimmte Email ein. Der heisse Scheiss sind Faxgeräte, von denen es in Deutschland ~14.000 Stück gibt. ( <a href="http://t-off.khd-research.net/Hist/TK_Chronik1.html#1984">Quelle.</a>) Menschen schreiben sich Briefe, per Hand, die tagelang unterwegs sind.</p>
<p><strong>Vor 20 Jahren, 1994</strong>, sind SMS gerade der heisse Scheiss geworden, nachdem sie 1992/1993 Marktreife erlangt haben. Telefone <a href="http://www.mobilephonehistory.co.uk/ericsson/ericsson_gh337.php">sehen so aus</a>, und bieten nichts ausser Telefonieren und SMS. Menschen schreiben sich Briefe, per Hand, die tagelang unterwegs sind.</p>
<p><strong>Vor nur 10 Jahren, 2004</strong>, gibt es weltweit ~1 Milliarde Handynutzer, und das Internet ist auf den Schreibtischen der westlichen Bevölkerung <em>irgendwie</em> schon angekommen. iPhone &amp; Co sind noch nicht erfunden; mobiles Internet ist teuer und langsam und wird auf klobigen Geräten mit Tastatur und winzigen Screens blockig in 2 Farben angezeigt. Menschen schreiben sich Briefe, per Hand, die tagelang unterwegs sind, aber nicht mehr so viele.</p>
<p><strong>Und heute, 2014?</strong> Sieben Milliarden Menschen weltweit haben mobile Telefone ( <a href="http://mobithinking.com/mobile-marketing-tools/latest-mobile-stats/a">Quelle</a>). Und wenn ich meine Liebste, die derzeit ohne mich im Ausland unterwegs ist, zu sehr vermisse, hole ich mein iPhone aus der Tasche und rufe sie an — per Video. Das kostet so gut wie nichts mehr (genau wie auch Text- und Bildnachrichten), die Qualität ist der Hammer und es benötigt keine technische Expertise. Die Screens sind superhochauflösend, in Farbe (!!!), und mein Smartphone gibt mir das komplette Internet und noch viel mehr in die Hand. <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief">Und hier gehts zur Wikipedia-Seite, die für die Jüngeren das Konzept “Brief” erklärt.</a></p>
<p><strong>Wie wird wohl 2024 aussehen?</strong> Ich weiss es nicht, aber verdammt, ich freue mich darauf.</p>
<p>Bis in zwei Wochen,</p>

<h2 id="gläserne-fahrbahnen">Gläserne Fahrbahnen</h2>
<p>Die Straßen der Zukunft sind aus Glas.</p>
<p>Zumindest ist das die Überzeugung von Julie und Scott Brusaw, den Gründern der (winzigen) US-Firma Solar Roadways. Über die letzten paar Jahre hinweg haben die zwei, zusammen mit ihren Helfern, ein neues Konzept für Straßen im 21. Jahrhundert entwickelt. Ihre Wege bestehen nicht länger aus Asphalt, sondern aus sechseckigen Glas-Segmenten, aus denen Fahrbahnen modular zusammengeschraubt werden. Die einzelnen Module sitzen dabei auf einer Art breiten Betonschalung, dadurch ist unter ihnen Platz für Kabel, Versorgungsleitungen und abfliessendes Regenwasser. Jedes Modul besteht aus mehreren Schichten — ganz oben das ultra-widerstandsfähige Sicherheitsglas, darunter die Elektronikkomponenten mit (u.A.) LEDs und Solarzellen.</p>
<p>Das ermöglicht Straßen, Parkplätze und Nutzflächen, die nicht nur Fahrzeugen eine möglichst einfache Fortbewegung erlauben, sondern die auch:</p>
<ul>
<li>einfallendes Sonnenlicht in Strom umwandeln — die Segmente sind Solarmodule!</li>
<li>sich selbst mit Strom versorgen, den Überschuss aber auch an andere Verbraucher (wie umliegende Häuser) abgeben können</li>
<li>dank eingebetteter LEDs wechselnde Fahrbahnmarkierungen (bei Nacht, Gefahrenhinweise, Stauwarnungen etc.) ermöglichen</li>
<li>flächendeckendere Verkehrsüberwachung erlauben</li>
<li>durch ihre modulare Bauweise einfach und schnell repariert werden können</li>
<li>sehr interessante Möglichkeiten für kommende autonome Fahrzeuge bieten, weil sie z.B. Elektroautos per Induktion während der Fahrt mit Strom versorgen könnten</li>
</ul>
<p>Die Brusaws nutzen ihren heimischen Hof als Testobjekt. Seit 2006 tüfteln sie hier an ihren Prototypen, die einen Teil ihrer Stellfläche pflastern, und verfeinern sie kontinuierlich. Ihr System funktioniert im Kleinen, aber sie sind davon überzeugt, dass es eben auch im Großen nur Vorteile mit sich bringt, gerade auch durch die Energieerzeugung. Ihre Rechnung diesbezüglich ist beeindruckend:</p>
<p>Die USA verfügen derzeit über ~81.000 km² Nutzfläche (Straßen, Parkplätze, Radwege etc.). Würde man die mit ihren Panelen (230W, 18.5% Effizienz) zupflastern, und ginge man von 4 Stunden guter Sonneneinstrahlung pro Tag aus, so könnte man so im Jahr über <strong>21.800 Milliarden kWh</strong> erzeugen. Auf Deutschland übertragen, wo es derzeit geschätzt 18.000 km² solcher Flächen gibt, würde das jährlich <strong>~4.850 Milliarden kWh erneuerbare Energie</strong> bedeuten. (Zum Vergleich: laut AG Energiebilanzen e.V. haben wir in DE im Jahr 2013 insgesamt “nur” ~495 Milliarden kWh verbraucht.)</p>
<p><em>“Aber… Straßen aus <strong>Glas</strong>‽”</em> Ja, keine Bange: das Spezialglas ist unglaublich bruch- und abriebfest, und jeder der hexagonalen Bausteine kann mit über 113 Tonnen Gewicht belastet werden. Und laut SR erlaubt die Oberfläche Fahrzeugen die gleiche Reibung bei Beschleunigen und Bremsen wie Asphalt, auch bei Nässe.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Clevere Straßen, die Strom erzeugen? Was kann man daran nicht mögen? Sicher, die initialen Kosten wären höher als bei normalen Asphaltstraßen, was sich aber durch die fortlaufende Energieerzeugung und auch die “eingebauten” Support von Versorgungsleitungen innerhalb weniger Jahre rechnen würde. Umstellung von Kupfer- auf Glasfaserleitungen? Dafür müsste man nicht mehr die Straße aufreissen, sondern lediglich ein paar der Panele abschrauben, herausheben und danach wieder einsetzen.</p>
<p>Und es gibt eine Menge Menschen, die den Traum von intelligenteren Transportwegen teilen: Solar Roadways’ Crowdfunding-Kampagne auf Indiegogo, bei der das Ehepaar Brusaw um $1.000.000 gebeten hatte, um ihr Projekt voranzutreiben, steht im Moment schon bei ~$1.930.000, und läuft noch bis 20. Juni.</p>

<h2 id="superpolymere">Superpolymere!</h2>
<p>IBM hat eine neue Gattung von Polymeren entwickelt, die beeindruckende Eigenschaften besitzen: sehr leicht, dabei stärker als menschliche Knochen, unempfindlich gegen Lösemittel, selbstheilend, und vollständig recyclebar. Je nach Mischung können sie in elastisch, in der Form von Gel, oder auch stark und starr wie Metalle daherkommen. Diese neuen experimentellen Polymere könnten den Weg zu billigeren, leichteren und umweltverträglicheren Werkstoffen ebnen; IBM schielt auf den Einsatz in der elektronischen Industrie, Luft- und Raumfahrt sowie den Fahrzeugbau.</p>
<p>Moment, Selbstheilung? Selbstheilung. Wenn sich in dem Stoff z.B. durch extreme Temperaturschwankungen Risse gebildet haben oder “Verletzungen” aufgetreten sind (Schnitte etc.), dann verschließen sich diese selbständig wieder — im Stoff findet eine sog. Wasserstoffbrückenbindung zwischen Molekülen statt.</p>
<p>Die meisten existierenden Polymere sind oft schwer bzw. gar nicht zu recyclen — wenn sie einmal ausgehärtet sind, können sie nicht mehr in ihre Einzelteile zerlegt werden. Oft bleiben dann nur noch der Schredder oder die Müllkippe, wenn sie ausgedient haben. IBMs neue Polymere dagegen lösen sich recht einfach wieder in in ihre Bestandteile auf, wenn man sie mit einer Säure behandelt. Und die Bestandteile können dann wiederverwendet werden.</p>

<h2 id="interessantes-zu-googles-auto-prototypen">Interessantes zu Googles Auto-Prototypen</h2>
<hr>
<h2 id="zu-guter-letzt">Zu guter Letzt…</h2>
<p>Letzte Woche stellte Google X die nächste Stufe ihres Projekts “Selbstfahrendes Automobil” vor: den Prototyp ihres ersten eigenen Autos, von der Bodenplatte aufwärts neu gedacht — ohne Lenkrad, ohne Pedale, dafür mit unglaublich vielen Sensoren und viel Software. Dafür geschaffen, ohne menschliches Eingreifen Personen zu befördern, und — wenn es funktioniert wie angekündigt — meiner Meinung nach das perfekte Beförderungsmittel für Großstädte.</p>
<p>Tolle Sache, aber nachdem u.A. auch schon die heute-Nachrichten darüber berichtet haben (Link weiter unten, wie gewohnt), will ich mich mehr auf <strong>zwei interessante Details konzentrieren.</strong></p>
<p>Die interessante Frage ist doch, warum hat der vorgestellte Prototyp kein Lenkrad und keine Pedale? Nun, anfangs gingen die Entwickler noch davon aus, dass die Passagiere sich unsicher in den Fahrzeugen fühlen würden, und ggf. in die Fahrt eingreifen wollen. Das war die erste Zeit auch so, aber die Testfahrer fühlten sich schon nach wenigen Fahrten <em>derartig</em> wohlbehütet, dass sie sich nicht mehr auf den Verkehr konzentrierten — sie fielen als Korrektiv schlichtweg aus. Die Techniker entschieden sich deshalb für ein <em>vollständig</em> autonomes Fahrzeug, mit doppelter Absicherung aller Systeme, das ohne semi-passiven Fahrer auskommt. Heiter. :)</p>
<p>Und wie hat das Google-Team die ganze Technik in die Fahrzeuge bekommen? Tja: hat es eigentlich gar nicht. Sicher, die Autos sind vollgestopft mit cleveren Systemen. Aber ohne das vor jeder Fahrt eingespeiste Kartenmaterial wären die Dinger recht hilflos. Zumal das Wort “Karte” hier eigentlich nicht aussagekräftig genug ist: Google hat das Einsatzgebiet des Prototypen nahezu zentimetergenau digital abgebildet und mit massig Extradaten aufgebohrt — wie Kurvenradii an Kreuzungen, Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzungen, Höhe der Verkehrsschilder usw.. Mit diesen Informationen zu den ~3.200 km Straße in ihrem Heimatgefilden können die Prototypen wesentlich einfacher agieren. Aufwändig? Sicher. Clever? Definitiv!</p>
<p>Allerdings bedeutet es halt auch, dass man die Fahrzeuge nicht einfach in Austin, Texas, oder Goatfuck, Indiana, absetzen kann und garantiert ist, dass sie dort problemlos funktionieren. Aber irgendwo muss man ja anfangen…</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-2">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Je mehr ich über dieses Projekt erfahre, desto beeindruckter bin ich. Es bringt viele verschiedene Disziplinen zusammen: Robotik, Kartografie, die digitale Abbildung von Verkehrswegen, Automobilbau, virtuelle Intelligenz, Lobbyarbeit… wow.</p>
<p>Bis jetzt haben sie ~3.200 km für das Projekt erfasst und kartografiert. Das US-Straßennetz hat insgesamt aber 4 mio km, was Projektchef Chris Urmson lediglich so kommentiert: <em>“Es ist Arbeit, ja, aber es ist keine einschüchternde Arbeit.”</em></p>
<p>Ich finds toll, dass es solche Menschen gibt. <em>Godspeed, you fancy bastards.</em> ;)</p>

<h2 id="smartphone-mikroskope-für-alle">Smartphone-Mikroskope für alle</h2>
<p>Revolutionen können auch im Kleinen passieren — in mehrerlei Hinsicht. Wissenschaftler in Australien haben eine einfache, aberwitzig billige und trotzdem sehr leistungsfähige Möglichkeit entwickelt, um aus jedem Smartphone bei Bedarf ein Mikroskop mit 160-facher Vergrößerung (bei einer Auflösung von 4 µm) zu machen. Sie basiert auf einem transparenten, flüssigen Polymer, das auf einen Glasträger aufgebracht wird und dort aushärtet. Nach und nach wird der Tropfen um zusätzliche Schichten erweitert, was die Stärke der Linse erhöht. Diese wird dann auf die Kamera eines Smartphones gepappt — voilá: Mikroskop.</p>
<p>Anwendungsmöglichkeiten finden sich dafür u.A. in der Landwirtschaft (Schädlinge und Pilzbefall bei Pflanzen lassen sich schneller analysieren, wenn der Bauer nur ein Bild machen muss, und dieses online an Experten schicken kann) oder auch der Tele-Dermatologie (gleiches Prinzip, Bauer optional).</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Fortschritt kommt oft auch auf leisen Sohlen daher. Es sind halt nicht immer nur die Multimilliarden-Dollar-Projekte, die die Welt verändern werden — bei industrieller Fertigung lägen die Kosten pro Linse bei weniger als 1 Cent! Aber das Konzept ist tatsächlich so simpel, dass es extrem kostengünstig auch daheim oder in weniger entwickelten Gegenden der Erde umgesetzt werden kann.</p>

<h2 id="kerosin-aus-sonnenenergie">Kerosin aus Sonnenenergie</h2>
<p>Das von der EU geförderte Projekt SOLAR-JET <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> hat es sich zum Ziel gesetzt, synthetisiertes Kerosin aus Sonnenenergie zu produzieren. Ende April vermeldete das Projekt einen großen Teilerfolg:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Der gesamte Produktionsprozess für erneuerbaren Kraftstoff aus Sonnenlicht, Wasser und Kohlendioxid (CO2) wurde erstmals erfolgreich durchlaufen. Darüber hinaus hat dieser Produktionsprozess das Potenzial, dass auch andere Kraftstoffarten wie Diesel, Benzin oder reiner Wasserstoff damit nachhaltig hergestellt werden könnten.</p>
<p>[…] Das Projekt SOLAR-JET entwickelte einen innovativen Prozess, bei dem konzentriertes Sonnenlicht CO2 und Wasser zu einem sogenannten Synthesegas umwandelt. Dies wird mittels einer Redoxreaktion von Metalloxiden bei hohen Temperaturen erreicht. Das Synthesegas, eine Mischung aus Wasserstoff und Kohlenmonoxid, wird abschließend mit Hilfe des bereits am Markt etablierten Fischer-Tropsch-Verfahrens in Kerosin umgewandelt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Die Chemiker des Projekts — u.A. vom Deutschen Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt, der ETH Zürich, Bauhaus Luftfahrt und Shell — haben in ihrem Testaufbau lediglich genug Kerosin produziert, um ein Einmachglas zu füllen. Ihrer Aussage nach würde ein Reaktor, der aus Solartürmen auf einer Fläche von 1 km² besteht, dann ca. 20.000 Liter pro Tag produzieren können.</p>
<p>Klingt toll! Aber wie so oft: dieses war lediglich der erste Streich, und der zweite folgt sogleich … bzw. innerhalb der nächsten vier Jahre, in denen die SOLAR-JET-Gruppe die Synthesegas-Produktion in einem von Sonnenlicht gespeisten 50 kW-Reaktor demonstrieren will.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-1">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Kraftstoff wird verbrannt und erzeugt CO2, das dann mit <em>Sonnenlicht</em> und Wasser wieder in Kraftstoff umgewandelt werden kann. It’s the circle of drive! Faszinierend.</p>
<p>Schön finde ich auch, dass es ein EU-gefördertes Forschungsprojekt ist. Die EU ist eben doch nicht so unnütz, wie gern behauptet wird. :)</p>

<h2 id="nominiert-für-den-grimme-online-award-2014">Nominiert für den Grimme Online Award 2014!</h2>
<p>Gestern durfte ich die etwas bizarre, aber durchaus tolle Einmal-im-Leben-Erfahrung machen, der Nominierungsveranstaltung für den diesjährigen <strong>Grimme Online Award</strong> beizuwohnen — als einer der Nominierten. Ja, mein kleiner Newsletter hier ist tatsächlich im Rennen um den GOA 2014, in der Kategorie “Information”. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Und so war ich dann mit meiner Liebsten gestern auf der offiziellen Nominierungsveranstaltung in Köln, um bei ziemlich guten Keksen den Grimme-Leuten zu lauschen, wie sie zwischen all den interessanten (und teilweise auch wirklich wichtigen!) nominierten Projekten meinen Namen nannten. Wie ich schon sagte: etwas bizarr. Es gab Videointerviews und Screenshots und Vorstellungen und alles! An einem Punkt wurde mir ein Mikro in die Hand gedrückt und ich durfte über die Idee hinter NadZ und den Recherche-Prozess etc. erzählen, und ich habe mich offenbar nicht blamiert, obschon gelacht wurde. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Zusammengefasst: <strong>Neues aus der Zukunft</strong> wurde mit 22 weiteren Projekten vom Nominierungskommission des Grimme Institut aus über 1350 eingereichten Vorschlägen herausgepickt — nach Durchsicht aller dieser Sites. Ich bin zu gleichen Teilen hocherfreut, stolz und immer noch verwirrt; und ich rechne mir nach einem Blick auf die “Konkurrenz” in meiner Kategorie keinerlei Chancen aus. Aber das ist schon okay, wenn sich dadurch die geschätzte Leserschaft vergrößert. :) Und: NadZ ist der erste Newsletter überhaupt, der je nominiert wurde.</p>
<p>Wie gehts jetzt weiter? Nun, ich vermute, die Jury zieht sich auf den höchsten Berg Deutschlands zurück, um in kontemplativer Abgeschiedenheit und/oder im Rahmen eines Deathmatches über die Gewinner in jeder Kategorie zu entscheiden. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> <strong>Die Ergebnisse werden dann am 27. Juni bekanntgegeben</strong>; bis dahin kann zusätzlich jeder Interwebsnutzer online ihre/seine Stimme für den <strong>Publikumspreis</strong> abgeben.

<p>+ <a href="http://zukun.tf/RMBCSp"><strong>“Luke Arm” erhält US-Marktzulassung.</strong></a> Einem meiner “Lieblingsprojekte” der letzten Jahre, das <em>Arm System</em> von DEKA-Research, wurde von der US-Behörde FDA offiziell die Marktzulassung erteilt. <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> (Die Zulassung ist nötig, um in die industrielle Fertigung gehen zu können, und die Arme zu denen zu bringen, die sie benötigen.) Das System wiegt soviel wie ein biologischer Arm, reagiert auf Muskel- und Nervensignale des Trägers, und setzt diese in 10 mögliche Bewegungen um. Damit wird dem Träger erlaubt, alltägliche Dinge zu tun wie Reissverschlüsse zu bedienen, selbständig zu essen, und Objekte wie Weintrauben zu greifen (ohne sie zu zerdrücken) oder auch volle Wasserflaschen (ohne sie fallenzulassen). Ein absolut großartiges Projekt. Bonuslink: ein TED-Video von 2010, in dem Dean Kamen (Gründer von DEKA Research) das Projekt vorstellt und erklärt, was ihn antreibt: <a href="http://zukun.tf/1vnW77C"><em>“The emotion behind invention”</em> (2010)</a> (das Video hat deutsche Untertitel, die unter “Subtitles” aufgerufen werden können).</p>
<p>+ <a href="http://www.softwheel.co.il/"><strong>Die israelische Firma SoftWheel erfindet das Rad neu.</strong></a> Ihre Räder kommen an Rollstühlen und Fahrrädern zum Einsatz, haben drei “Speichen” (wenn man sie noch so nennen kann), die eingebaute Stoßdämpfung besitzen. (Danke für den Link, <a href="https://twitter.com/optikfluffel">@optikfluffel</a>.)</p>
<p>+ <a href="http://zukun.tf/1vo2szT"><strong>Ein querschnittsgelähmter Mann in einem Exoskelett wird den World Cup 2014 eröffnen.</strong></a> Ein junger Brasilianer wird sich am 12. Juni in São Paulo aus seinem Rollstuhl erheben, unterstützt von einem robotischen Exoskelett das Feld betreten, und den Ball kicken. Die Technologie soll nach dem Willen ihrer Schöpfer eines Tages Rollstühle ersetzen, indem sie die Bewegungen ausführt, zu denen ihre Träger selbst nicht mehr fähig sind. Gesteuert wird sie durch einen mit Elektroden gespickten Helm, der die Hirnströme des Trägers ausliest und an das Skelett weiterleitet. Fun fact: ein Teil der Entwicklung kommt aus München. (Genau wie dieser Newsletter! ZOMG.)</p>
<p>Da ich mich nicht für diesen Sport interessiere, kann ich leider nicht sagen, ob Fussball hier auch soviel Aufmerksamkeit geniesst wie in Brasilien, und somit kann ich nur <em>hoffen</em>, dass diese Demonstration auch hierzulande die Aufmerksam bekommt, die es verdient.</p>

Es ging um Tourismus, Satelliten, Rohstoffabbau, den Mond, Transportsysteme und -verträge, und mehr. Neu für mich: die US-Firma Space Adventures plant für das Jahr 2017 oder 2018 eine bemannte Mondumrundung für Privatpersonen, der Preis pro Passagier wird mind. $150 mio USD betragen — und sie haben schon zwei Sitze verkauft.</p>

			 <p>Donnerstagmorgen sind dafür da, um zu schauen, was während der letzten 20 Ausgabe von <strong>NadZ</strong> (nicht) passiert ist. Unsere Zivilgesellschaft stellt sich weiterhin gegen die Vorratsdatenspeicherung, zwei verstorbene Päpste wurden für beeindruckendes Papsting heiliggesprochen, es gab keine einzige Roboterrevolution und die Erde wurde nicht von einem Asteroiden vernichtet.</p>
<p>Gute Arbeit, liebe Leser. Macht weiter so!</p>
<p>In dieser #20 gibts wieder mal schöne Nachrichten, die etwas mit jungen und alten Mäusen zu tun haben. Aufgemerkt: ich wiederhole mich dabei nicht, es werden tatsächlich dauernd neue Studien veröffentlicht, die unterschiedliche Ansätze verfolgen und Aufregendes vermelden. Erinnert Ihr Euch noch an meinen <a href="http://zukun.tf/1np3y9W">ersten Satz in der ersten <strong>NadZ</strong>-Ausgabe</a>? <em>“Hi, ich bin Carlo Zottmann, und ich werde 140 Jahre alt, mindestens.”</em> Meine Meinung zu dem Thema hat sich nicht geändert. ;)</p>
<p>Die ersten Crowdfunding-Zahlen sind da: 10 Unterstützer haben sich seit der letzten Ausgabe gefunden, <a href="http://zukun.tf/1np26o4">in der ich meine Patreon-Kampagne vorgestellt habe</a>. Ich danke Euch! Ihr seid dufte. :) Die Aktion läuft natürlich weiter, <a href="http://www.patreon.com/neuesausderzukunft">wer also etwas zu <strong>NadZ</strong> beisteuern möchte</a>: &lt;3, danke.</p>
<p>Habt Ihr eine Meinung dazu? Gut, schlecht, weiss nicht? <a href="mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de">Schreibt mir Mails</a>! Mich würde auch mal interessieren, ob Ihr die Ausgaben als zu lang, zu kurz oder als gerade richtig empfindet.</p>
<p>Bis in zwei Wochen,</p>
<p>—Carlo.</p>
<p>PS: Über die <em>so! guten! Nachrichten!</em>, die ich beim letzten Mal erwähnte, kann ich definitiv in der nächsten Ausgabe berichten. Hurra!</p>

<h2 id="gdf11-das-jungbrunnen-protein">GDF11: das Jungbrunnen-Protein</h2>
<p>Drei neu veröffentlichte Studien, die die langjährige Arbeit zweier unabhängiger Forschungsgruppen in Cambridge und Kalifornien (USA) zusammenfassen, bringen mich zum fröhlichen Kichern: die Wissenschaftler untersuchten den Effekt eines Proteins namens GDF11, das im Blut junger Mäuse (und auch junger Menschen) vorkommt, aber so gut wie gar nicht mehr im Blut ihrer alten Artgenossen.</p>
<p>Durch Bluttransfusionen, durch gezielte Injektionen und auch durch ein verstörendes Verfahren namens Parabiose <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> wurden alte Mäuse mit jenem Protein versorgt — und ihre Muskeln, Herzen und auch Hirne wurden wieder jugendlich. Die Ergebnisse sind dramatisch und verheissen Großes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Die im Alter erschlafften oder verhärteten Herzmuskeln wurden wieder geschmeidig und kräftig, die Herzen arbeiteten wie bei Jungtieren.</li>
<li>In den Hirnen der alten Tiere bildeten sich neue Blutgefässe, und auch der Blutfluss wurde erhöht — ebenfalls wie bei Jungtieren, die Mäuse waren in Tests geistig agiler als ihre Artgenossen aus Kontrollgruppen.</li>
<li>Die Muskeln regenerierten sich ebenfalls, die Tiere wurden leistungsfähiger und fitter.</li>
<li>Der feine Geruchssinn der Nager kehrte zurück, sie schreckten vor unangenehmen Gerüchen ebenso schnell zurück wie die Jungen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Man könnte sagen: das Erhöhen des GDF11-Protein-Levels drehte bei den Mäusen für jedes untersuchte Organ die Uhr zurück.</strong> Und wie bereits erwähnt, kommt GDF11 ebenfalls in Homo Sapiens vor.</p>
<p><strong>Aber:</strong> GDF11 ist nur ein Protein von vielen, und es ist sehr wahrscheinlich nicht <strong>das</strong> Allheilmittel gegen das Altern. Einige Wissenschaftler, die an den Studien beteiligt waren, und auch einige, die nichts damit zu tun hatten, vermuten, dass das Protein nur ein einzelner Baustein ist unter vielen, die noch unbekannt sind. Mehr Forschung ist nötig, und es ist nicht gesagt, dass sich die Ergebnisse der Studien 1:1 auf Menschen übertragen lassen. Und möglicherweise existieren auch Risiken, die sich erst in weiteren Experimenten zeigen — wer weiss.</p>
<p>Also bleiben wir ruhig, hoffen wir auf das Beste und beobachten wir die Sache. (Diese Aufforderung geht in erster Linie an mich selbst.) Derweil sind die Forscher mit Risikokapitalgebern in Gesprächen, um rasch finanzielle Mittel für weitere Forschung und eventuelle prä-klinische Tests zu sichern. Sollten keine Showstopper auftreten, gehen sie von ersten klinischen GDF11-Tests an Menschen in den nächsten 3 bis 5 Jahren aus.</p>
<p>Aber bei aller gebotenen Vorsicht sind dies in meinen Augen ganz, ganz famose Neuigkeiten. :)</p>

<h2 id="nerven-aus-stahl">Nerven aus Stahl</h2>
<p>Forschern an der Tsinghua-Universität in Beijing (China) haben in Experimenten gezeigt, dass die Enden von durchtrennten Nerven mithilfe sog. flüssiger Metalle wieder verbunden werden können, so dass durch die Nerven wieder Signale übertragen werden. (Flüssige Metalle sind Metalle, deren Schmelzpunkt unterhalb der Zimmertemperatur liegt.) Im Labor verbanden die Forscher die Nervenenden eines durchtrennten Ochsenfrosch-Beinmuskels mit einem dünnen Strang einer Gallium-Indium-Selenium-Legierung. Die Signale, die sie dann an einem der Enden anlegten, liefen nahezu verlustfrei durch das sehr gut leitende Metall zum anderen Ende hin.</p>
<p>Die Vision des Teams ist, durchtrennte Nervenpartien, die z.B. durch Unfälle entstanden sind, schnell umgehen zu können, um eine Heilung zu ermöglichen. Nerven wachsen pro Tag nur ca. 1 Millimeter, und es kann bei Verletzungen lange dauern, bis gekappte Enden sich wieder verbinden. In dieser Zeit liegt aber u.U. die Signalübertragung vom Hirn zu den verbundenen Muskeln brach, was nachhaltige Schäden mit sich bringen kann. Die Forscher arbeiten nun an speziellen “Nervenprothesen”, die die durchtrennten Sektionen überbrücken können, um das Wachstum der Nerven zu stimulieren und dabei auch die Muskelfunktionen zu erhalten.</p>
<p>Die Idee und ihr Prototyp sind ziemlich vielversprechend, aber es gibt (wenig überraschend) noch einige Unklarheiten, z.B. wie der menschliche Körper auf das Metall reagieren würde, sowie ob und wie stark die Muskeln von einer solchen Behandlung profitieren würden.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Selbst nach Jahrzehnten der Forschung gibt es immer noch keine wirklich effektive Methoden für das Verbinden durchtrennter Nerven. Das ist ein Problem, das gelöst werden will, und die chinesische Studie macht Hoffnung!</p>
<p>Plus: die Idee, ein wenig Terminator-Technik im Körper zu haben, ist doch cool, oder? ;)</p>

<h2 id="cybathlon-2016">Cybathlon 2016</h2>
<p>In gut zwei Jahren, am 8. Oktober 2016, wird in der Schweiz der erste <strong>Cybathlon</strong> starten — eine Veranstaltung wie die Olympischen Spiele, nur für Cyborgs, also Menschen mit bionischen Prothesen und Assistenzsystemen. Sie wird mehrere Disziplinen bieten, u.A. Wettläufe für Träger bionischer Beinprothesen und auch virtuelle Rennen, die über Hirn-Computer-Schnittstellen ausgetragen werden. Die Gemeinsamkeit aller Disziplinen: sogenannte “Assistenzsysteme” sind nicht nur gestattet, sondern explizit erwünscht, ebenso wie robotische Technik.</p>
<p>Die Organisatoren hoffen, dass ihr Cybathlon einen ähnlichen Effekt auf die Bionik hat wie der <em>Ansari X-Prize</em>, der über die letzten zwei Jahrzehnte den NewSpace-Boom <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> ausgelöst und befeuert hat, oder auch die <em>DARPA Grand Challenge</em>, die sich auf autonome Fahrzeuge fokussierte, und aus der u.A. Google X’ selbstfahrende Automobile hervorgingen.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-1">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Das ist die erste Sportveranstaltung, die ich freiwillig besuchen würde — das allein bringt mich schon aus der Fassung. ;)</p>
<p>Ich denke, solch öffentliche “Spektakel” (im positivsten Sinne des Wortes) sind geeignete Instrumente, um die Menschheit langsam an die Idee zu gewöhnen, dass Prothesen und bionische Technik <del>langsam</del> die Labore verlassen. Wir werden sicherlich in nicht allzu ferner Zukunft den Punkt erreichen, wo der Grund für viele Implantate und Prothesen nicht zwangsläufig ein vorangeganger Unfall ist, sondern die bewusste Entscheidung ihrer Besitzer.</p>
<p>Für einen (winzigen) Einblick in das, was heute schon möglich ist, und Ausblick auf das, was noch kommen kann &amp; wird, empfehle ich den aktuellen TED-Talk von Hugh Herr, dem Chef der Biomechatronics-Gruppe des MIT Media Lab: <a href="http://youtu.be/CDsNZJTWw0w"><em>“The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance”</em></a> (Video, 19:00 min, englisch).</p>

<h2 id="protein-basierte-biosensoren">Protein-basierte Biosensoren</h2>
<p>In den letzten vier Jahren ist ein Team um Joshua Leonard, Assistenzprofessor für chemisches und biologisches Engineering an der Northwestern McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science, <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> der Frage nachgegangen, ob und wie man einen Protein-basierten Biosensor auf einer organischen Zelle anbringen kann.</p>
<p>Ein solcher Sensor könnte das Umfeld der Zelle überwachen, und bei bestimmten Gegebenheiten in ihr unterschiedliche Mechanismen auslösen. Zum Beispiel könnte ein solcher Sensor feststellen, wenn sich die Zelle neben einem Tumor befindet, ein Signal an den Zellkern abgeben, der dann die Produktion von Tumor-tötende Chemikalien oder Proteinen beginnt. Solch veränderte Zellen würden durch den Körper reisen, und ihre “Programme” triggern, wenn sie an der richtigen Stelle angekommen sind.</p>
<p>Nun, <strong>Dr. Leonard’s Forschung war erfolgreich: seine Gruppe hat Mitte April eine derartige Technologie vorgestellt.</strong> Sie haben genau diese Art von Biosensor-Plattform entwickelt. Diese ist so konzipiert, dass mehrere Sensoren an eine einzelne modifizierte Zelle angedockt werden können, und sich dabei gegenseitig nicht ins Gehege kommen — Biomechanikern ist damit die Möglichkeit gegeben, für unterschiedliche Szenarien unterschiedliche Aktionen zu “programmieren”.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-2">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Die Behandlung von Krankheiten (z.B. Krebs) ist eine Sache. Die <em>punktgenaue</em> Behandlung von Krankheiten ist eine andere. Die neue Technologie, die das McCormick-Labor entwickelt hat, zielt auf die hyperlokale Behandlung von Problemen ab, die ohne die Schädigung des umgebenden Gewebes auskommt. Wobei ich da allerdings auch potentielle Anwendungsmöglichkeiten auf dem Gebiet der, ach, sagen wir der Langlebigkeitsforschung sehe. :)</p>

<p>+ <a href="http://zukun.tf/1njkFKo"><strong>Ein gemeinsames Projekt der Carnegie Mellon University und Disney Research (Pittsburgh, USA) hat einen 3D-Drucker für flauschige Sachen hervorgebracht.</strong></a> Das Konzept ist das gleiche wie bei herkömmlichen Druckern: die Maschine wird mit einem 3D-Modell gefüttert, und druckt es Schicht für Schicht aus. Nur können es in diesem Fall Teddies und Mützen sein, für die der Drucker Wolle und Kunststofffasern verfilzt. Heiss! Und für all jene, die jetzt sehnsüchtig Omas guter alter Handarbeit nachtrauern: müsst Ihr nicht, denn auch da gibt es Neues — auf <a href="http://maleknitting.de/">meines Kollegen Lutz’ Strickblog MaleKnitting.de</a>. :)</p>
<p>+ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_CRS-3"><strong>Am 18. April startete von Cape Canaveral aus eine neue Lieferung für die ISS.</strong></a> Lieferant (wie schon mehrfach vorher) ist die kalifornische Firma SpaceX. Dieser Start war aber etwas Besonderes: die erste der Stufen der Rakete vom Typ <em>Falcon 9</em> kehrte zur Erde zurück, um zu landen! Es handelte sich um den ersten “öffentlichen” SpaceX-Test in ihrem laufenden Projekt, Raketen wiederverwendbar zu machen (mehr dazu in <a href="http://zukun.tf/1neYck0">Ausgabe #2, <em>“Wirtschaftlichkeit… IN SPACE”</em></a>). Die Landung erfolgte bei diesem ersten Live-Test aus Sicherheitsgründen noch über dem offenen Meer — die Stufe bremste erfolgreich über dem Ozean ab, und wäre eine ebene Fläche und keine tosende See an dieser Stelle gewesen, hätte sie sich selbständig geparkt. Fantastisch! Warum das eine große Sache ist, hat Jason Dorrier sehr schön auf Singularity Hub zusammengefasst: <a href="http://zukun.tf/1neYesa"><em>“Can Elon Musk And SpaceX Take Space Travel From Evolutionary To Revolutionary?”</em></a>.</p>
<p>+ Dass nicht alle Frauen weltweit die gleichen Rechte geniessen, ist bekannt (und zum Wahnsinnigwerden). <strong>Vor ein paar Wochen <a href="http://zukun.tf/1qb5oQn">startete die 18-jährige Inderin Amala Dasarathi deshalb eine Petition auf Change.org</a>, in der sie die Verkehrsbetriebe von Bangalore (BMTC) dazu aufrief, auf die wiederkehrende Belästigung von Frauen in ihren Bussen zu reagieren.</strong> Innerhalb kürzester Zeit kamen über 50.000 Unterschriften aus aller Welt zusammen, und Amala konnte Anfang dieser Woche einen Erfolg vermelden:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] Die Verkehrsbetriebe von Bangalore (BMTC) haben begonnen, in allen Bussen eine gut sichtbare Notruftelefonnumer für Frauen einzurichten. Der Geschäftsführer Kumar Pushkar hat direkt auf meine Petition mit einem Antwortschreiben reagiert!
Neben der Telefonnummer wir es noch weitere Maßnahmen geben, wie z.B. spezielle Sitzbereiche nur für Frauen, ein Training für Busfahrer (zur Sensibilisierung für das Problem), Überwachungskameras in den Bussen und regelmäßige Aufklärungskampagnen. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Babyschritte, sicher — aber jeder kleine Erfolg zählt! Ja, auch solch eine Meldung gibt mir Hoffnung für die Menschheit.</p>

<h2 id="organ-erstmalig-regeneriert">Organ erstmalig regeneriert</h2>
<p>Eine Gruppe Wissenschaftler an der Universität von Edinburgh, Schottland, hat in alten Mäusen den Thymus regeneriert, ein Organ des lymphatischen Systems und Teil des Immunsystems. Der Thymus produziert die weißen Blutzellen (Leukozyten), die wichtig zur Abwehr von Infektionen sind. Er bildet sich im Laufe des Lebens zurück, was einer der Gründe für die im Alter auftretende Immunoseneszenz ist, die Verschlechterung des Immunsystems, und die damit verbundene höhere Anfälligkeit für Infektionen.</p>
<p>Es handelt sich hier um die erste Regeneration eines lebenden Organs — die Forscher reaktivierten einen natürlichen Mechanismus, der vom Körper im Alter deaktiviert wird, um den Thymus zu regenerieren. Nach der Behandlung wies das Organ die gleichen Merkmale wie in Jungtieren auf, und begann, wieder mehr Leukozyten herzustellen.</p>
<p>Bis jetzt ist allerdings noch nicht klar, ob das allein schon ausreicht, das Immunsystem der alten Mäuse umfassend zu stärken, aber die Mediziner sagen, dass die Vermutung naheliegt. Und bevor Versuche mit menschlichen Patienten möglich sind, ist laut den Autoren der Studie noch mehr Forschungsarbeit nötig.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Die Regeneration gelang, indem die Forscher ein einziges Protein reaktivierten. Sie vermuten, dass die gleichen Mechanismen auch in Menschen greifen würden. Sollte sich diese Vermutung als korrekt erweisen, hätte das zweifellos massive Auswirkungen auf die regenerative Medizin.</p>
<p>Die Vorstellung, das ganze Leben lang gesund wie ein Teenager zu sein und im Alter nicht mehr bei jedem Husten nervös werden zu müssen, finde ich großartig.</p>

<h2 id="in-eigener-sache-nadz-crowdfunding">In eigener Sache: NadZ-Crowdfunding</h2>
<p>Hin und wieder werde ich gefragt, wie <strong>Neues aus der Zukunft</strong> eigentlich zustande kommt. Habe ich einen Haufen superintelligente Äffchen gezüchtet, die den ganzen Tag kettenrauchend im Netz rumhängen und nach Themen Ausschau halten? Oder benutze ich eine hochentwickelte AI, die unermüdlich Pressemitteilungen von Forschungseinrichtungen und Universitäten durchforstet und die interessantesten Kandidaten zusammen mit erbaulichen Bonmots für die Veröffentlichung mischt?</p>
<p>Genau so!</p>
<p>Nein. :)</p>
<p>So gehts wirklich: ich habe eine Anzahl von englischsprachigen Wissenschaftsblogs und -kanälen abonniert, die ich täglich verfolge. Wenn ich in der Flut von Meldungen Neuigkeiten sehe, die mir interessant erscheinen, grabe ich mich in meiner freien Zeit tiefer in die Materie und die damit verbundenen Meldungen ein, und fasse sie auf Deutsch zusammen. Da ich selbst nur ein interessierter Amateur bin, ist das oft ein relativ langwieriger Prozess. In jede Ausgabe investiere ich so geschätzt um die 30 Stunden.</p>
<p>Ich bin selbständiger Softwareentwickler, und muss jeden Monat aufs Neue entscheiden, wieviel Zeit ich ich Kundenprojekten und in eigene Projekte investieren kann — meine Erwerbstätigkeit bringt das Geld, das ich in “Karma-Projekte” wie NadZ investieren kann. Mehr Kunden-Gigs == weniger freie Zeit.</p>
<p>Mein Wunsch ist es, das ein wenig entzerren zu können, um etwas mehr Zeit für die Arbeit am Newsletter zu haben.</p>
<p>Aus dem Grund habe ich auf der ziemlich tollen Site Patreon <a href="http://www.patreon.com/neuesausderzukunft"><strong>eine monatliche Crowdfunding-Kampagne</strong></a> angelegt, bei der Ihr selbst bestimmen könnt, was Euch NadZ pro Monat wert ist. <strong>Wenn Euch also gefällt, was ich hier veranstalte, dann fände ich es total nett, würdet Ihr Euch meine <a href="http://www.patreon.com/neuesausderzukunft">Patreon-Seite</a> mal anschauen.</strong></p>
<p>Vielen Dank! :)</p>
<h3 id="kurzvorstellung-patreon">Kurzvorstellung: Patreon</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.patreon.com">Patreon.com</a> ist eine feine Site, auf der man kreative Menschen einfach mit kleinen Beträgen finanziell anfeuern kann. Ich persönlich <a href="http://www.patreon.com/neuesausderzukunft?pat=1">unterstütze darüber selbst einige andere Sites</a>, und kann sie daher auch aus Unterstützer-Sicht empfehlen. Man kann Paypal- oder Kreditkarten-Daten hinterlegen, und am Ende des Monats werden die einzelnen “Versprechen” dann von Patreon abgebucht. Und wenn man eine Unterstützung beenden möchte, geht das ebenso unkompliziert wie das Zusagen.</p>

<h2 id="smartphone-laden-in-30-sekunden">Smartphone laden in 30 Sekunden</h2>
<p>Die israelische Firma StoreDot hat eine neuartige Batterietechnik entwickelt, die extrem schnelle Ladung erlaubt. Ihr Prototyp eines Smartphone-Akkus z.B. kann in <em>weniger als einer Minute</em> von fast leer auf 100% gebracht werden.</p>
<p>Die Grundlagen für StoreDot’s Technologie wurden putzigerweise während eines komplett anderen Forschungsprojekts an der Universität von Tel Aviv gefunden, in dem es um die Alzheimer-Krankheit ging. In dieser bemerkten die Wissenschaftler, dass ein bestimmtes, auch im menschlichen Hirn vorkommendes Peptid-Molekül eine hohe elektrische Kapazität aufwies und fähig war, Elektronen “festzuhalten”.</p>
<p>Aus zwei dieser Moleküle stellt StoreDot jetzt winzige Kristalle her, die lediglich 2 Nanometer lang sind — sog. “Nanodots”. Diese Nanodots funktionieren in den neuen Akkus wie Puffer, die einfliessenden elektrischen Strom (aus dem Ladegerät) zwischenspeichern, und nach und nach an das Lithium des Akkus abgeben. Nach Angabe der Firma werden sie aus bio-organischen Rohmaterialien hergestellt, sind umweltfreundlich und nicht toxisch.</p>
<p>StoreDot’s CEO Doron Myersdorf sagte, dass seine Firma plant, in einem weiteren Schritt komplett auf Lithium in ihren Akkus zu verzichten. Und die veränderten chemischen Reaktionen in den Akkus sollten sich auf deren Lebensdauer auswirken, und die Anzahl der möglichen Ladezyklen von mehreren Hundert (Durchschnitt heute) auf mehrere Tausend erhöhen, ohne dass die Geräte größer oder schwerer werden würden.</p>
<p>StoreDot hofft, 2016 in Massenfertigung bzw. Serienproduktion gehen zu können.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-1">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Akkus stecken mittlerweile in so ziemlich jedem Ding: Smartphones, Wecker, Gamepads, Laptops, Sexspielzeuge usw. Und auch der weltweite Markt für Elektro-Fahrzeuge wächst <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> — aber die größten Hürden bei der Adoption sind für viele Menschen immer noch Ladezeit und auch Akkugröße. Wenn das Eine extrem reduziert und das Andere stark erhöht werden könnte, wäre das Konzept wesentlich attraktiver.</p>

<p>Forscher am Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT) haben in Zusammenarbeit mit Evonik Industries neuartige Kunststoffe entwickelt, die sich bei relativ niedrigen Temperaturen sehr schnell und beliebig oft wiederholbar selbst heilen.</p>
<p><em>“Ob Kratzer im Autolack oder Risse im polymeren Material: Selbstheilende Werkstoffe können sich selbst reparieren, indem sie nach Beschädigungen ihre ursprüngliche molekulare Struktur wiederherstellen. Wissenschaftler des Karlsruher Instituts für Technologie und Evonik Industries entwickelten eine chemische Vernetzungsreaktion, durch die sich bei milder Erwärmung innerhalb kurzer Zeit gute Heilungseigenschaften des Materials erreichen lassen. […] Es ließ sich nachweisen, dass die Testkörper nach der ersten Heilung sogar stärker gebunden sind als vorher.”</em></p>

<h2 id="die-neuen-aushilfsherzen">Die neuen Aushilfsherzen</h2>
<p>Ein Team an der George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences (USA) hat im Labor ein komplett neues Organ entwickelt: ein aus Herzmuskelzellen bestehendes Mini-Herz, das wie eine Schelle um eine Vene herum liegt. Bei Patienten mit Veneninsuffizienz kann es so dem Blutfluss auf die Sprünge helfen — indem es selbständig das Blut in der Vene weiterpumpt, und damit dem Herzen Arbeit abnimmt.</p>
<p>Diese neuartige, organische “Schellen” wurden aus adulten Stammzellen des Patienten hergestellt, was bedeutet, dass das Risiko, dass der Körper das Organ abstösst, so gut wie nicht gegeben ist. Abgefahrenes Konzept: um ein kaputtes Organ zu entlasten, unterstützen die Wissenschaftler es mit <em>einem komplett neuen</em> Hilfsorgan.</p>
<p>Was ich daran besonders interessant finde, ist die Herangehensweise von der rein mechanischen Seite, den die Mediziner gewählt haben: ein wichtiges Teil X in einem Kreislauf funktioniert nicht mehr korrekt, aber ein Ersatzteil dafür ist nicht verfügbar, also wie könnte man den Kreislauf sonst am Laufen halten? Das gefällt mir.</p>
<p>Im Artikel befindet sich auch ein kurzes 5-Sekunden-Video, das das Organ bei der Arbeit zeigt.</p>

<h2 id="wahnsinnige-geschwindigkeit">&ldquo;Wahnsinnige Geschwindigkeit!&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Mein Desktop-Rechner, ein Mac mini, hat einen tollen Prozessor, der machtvoll genug ist für alles, was ich ihm an Arbeit zuweise, und ich bin damit sehr glücklich. Der Prozessor hat 4 Kerne, die mit einer Geschwindigkeit von ~2,4 GHz (Gigahertz) operieren. Mein iPhone, mit dem ich auch sehr glücklich bin, arbeitet mit einer Geschwindigkeit von ~1,3 GHz.</p>
<p>Das erwähne ich nur, weil es hilfreich ist, um die folgende Meldung einzuordnen.</p>
<p>An der National University von Singapur haben Forscher jetzt im Rahmen einer Studie einen Schaltkreis entwickelt, die mit Frequenzen von bis zu 245 THz (Terahertz) arbeitet — was ungefähr <strong>das 100.000-Fache dessen ist, was der Prozessor meines eingangs erwähnten treuen Macs leistet</strong>.</p>
<p>Ihre Erfindung fusst auf einem neuen physikalischen Prozess namens “quanten-plasmonische Tunnelung” ( <em>“quantum plasmonic tunneling”</em>), bei dem es um ultra-hochfrequente Oszillationen von Elektronen geht, die auf Nanoebene mit Licht gesteuert werden können.</p>
<p>Als nächsten Schritt wollen die Teufelskerle aus Singapur die möglichen Integrationen ihrer neuen Technologie in “echte” elektronische Geräte untersuchen. Denn noch ist ihr Prototyp eben nur ein Prototyp: der Beweis der Machbarkeit einer Idee. Aber das wird schon… :)</p>

			 <p>Donnerstagmorgen sind dafür da, um sich über den 100. Tag des Jahres zu freuen.</p>
<p>Die letzten zwei Wochen sahen mehr coole Meldungen, als ich in dieser Ausgabe unterbringen konnte. Eine der schönsten, weil vernünftigsten News kam aus Brüssel, wo das EU-Parlament klar für die Durchsetzung der Netzneutralität gestimmt hat<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Das klingt jetzt erst einmal sehr trocken und wenig greifbar, hat aber große Auswirkungen darauf, wie sich das Netz für uns alle in den kommenden Jahren weiterentwickeln wird, und hat mich optimistisch und sehr happy gemacht. Daumen hoch, EU-Parlament — gute Arbeit für die Bürger, danke dafür!</p>
<p>In der nahen Zukunft sehe ich für mich einen Kaffee, und eventuell auch die eine oder andere <a href="mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de">Leser-Mail an mich</a> — zwei meiner liebsten Dinge auf der Welt. ;)</p>

<h2 id="solarzellendisplays">Solarzellendisplays</h2>
<p>Kluge Menschen an der Nanyang Technological University in Singapur haben einen neues Material entwickelt, das auf dem Mineral Perowskit basiert, und sowohl Energie aus Sonnenlicht generieren kann, als auch selbst Licht abgeben kann, wenn es mit Strom versorgt wird.</p>
<p>Kurz zusammengefasst: <strong>dieses Material hat das Potential, gleichzeitig Solarzelle und Display zu sein.</strong> Öha! Ich sehe da iPads und Smartphones vor meinem geistigen Auge, die nur Licht brauchen, um sich aufzuladen. Und halbtransparente Fenster, die Strom erzeugen. Und und und…</p>
<p>Die Entdeckung fand durch Zufall stand: die Wissenschaftler wollten eigentlich nur ihre neue Perowskit-Solarzelle erproben, indem sie einen Laser auf sie richteten. Zu ihrer Überraschung fing das Ding dann selbst an zu leuchten — es wandelte das einfallende Licht in Energie um, und verwendete diese dann umgehend selbst für die Erzeugung von Licht. Überraschung — große Freude — Sektkorken — Pressemitteilung. Tolle G’schicht. :)</p>
<p>Das neue Wundermaterial ist fünfmal billger herzustellen als derzeit aktuelle Silizium-basierte Solarzellen, und einfacher noch dazu. Das Patent ist angemeldet.</p>

<h2 id="infrarotsicht-mit-kontaktlinsen">Infrarotsicht mit Kontaktlinsen</h2>
<p>Wissenschaftler an der Universität von Michigan, USA, haben einen winzigen Lichtsensor auf Graphen-Basis entwickelt, der bei Raumtemperatur das volle Infrarotspektrum wahrnehmen kann. Der Teil mit der Raumtemperatur ist hierbei essentiell, fallen somit doch die üblichen Kühlkörper weg, die nötig sind, um das ganze Spektrum abzudecken, und bei herkömmlichen Wärmebildkameras viel Platz einnehmen. Und dank dem Einsatz von Graphen, das “von Haus aus” das komplette Infrarotspektrum erfassen kann, und cleverem Engineering ist ihre Entwicklung extrem dünn. Wie dünn? Nach Aussage der Projektleiter könnte sie in Smartphones, Geräten wie Google Glass oder auch Kontaktlinsen integriert werden. <strong>Kontaktlinsen mit Wärmebildtechnologie!</strong> WILL ICH.</p>
<p>Meine Güte, Graphen… Graphen kann <strong>alles</strong>. Wenn ich <em>den einen</em> Werkstoff des bisherigen 21. Jahrhunderts nennen müsste, wäre es Graphen — es ist supraleitend, super-stark und super-flexibel. Graphen ist gerade mal <em>ein Atom</em> dick, und hat tausende Anwendungsmöglichkeiten in Dutzenden von Fachgebieten. Graphen in “zusammengerollter” Form bildet Kohlenstoffnanoröhren, die ebenfalls ziemlich fantastische technische Möglichkeiten bieten! Graphen weiss, wo Carmen Sandiego ist und das verschwundene Lindbergh-Baby!! Graphen war maßgeblich an Kanye West’s letzten drei Alben beteiligt, hat dafür gesorgt, dass <em>Wetten, dass…?</em> endlich abgesetzt wurde, macht frischen Atem und volles Haar und schmeckt großartig mit Sauce Béarnaise und frischen Waldpilzen!!!</p>

<h2 id="crispr-gentherapie-repariert-gendefekt">CRISPR-Gentherapie repariert Gendefekt</h2>
<p>Vor wenigen Monaten stellten zwei Wissenschaftlerinnen aus Schweden und den USA ihre revolutionäre Methode namens CRISPR-CAS9 vor, um DNA in einem komplexen Genom akkurat zu bearbeiten. Ich schrieb sehr begeistert darüber in NadZ #8, und betitelte die Meldung <em>“Durchbruch in der Gentechnik”</em>.</p>
<p>Vor knapp zwei Wochen zeigten mir Neuigkeiten vom Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) dann, dass der Titel gut gewählt war:</p>
<p>Biologen und Genetiker des Institutes haben erwachsene Mäuse von einer seltenen Leberkrankheit geheilt, bei der die Leberzellen unfähig sind, eine Aminosäure namens Tyrosin abzubauen, da sie ein bestimmtes Enzym nicht bilden können. Durch eine auf CRISPR basierende Gentherapie wurde die kranke Leber animiert, fehlerhaftes Erbgut in Zellen durch gesundes zu ersetzen. Nach einer Weile hatte die Leber genug gesunde Zellen gebildet, um wieder ohne Medikamente auszukommen.</p>
<p>Besagte Krankheit tritt aufgrund einer einzelnen genetischen Mutation bei 1 von 100.000 Menschen auf, und führt unbehandelt unweigerlich zu Leberversagen, weshalb Patienten lebenslang auf Medikamente angewiesen sind. <strong>Die neue MIT-Studie zeigt, dass das kranke Organ mit einer einzigen Gentherapie-Behandlung nachhaltig kuriert werden kann</strong> — bei Mäusen.</p>
<p>Die Forschungsergebnisse sind natürlich nicht so einfach auf Menschen übertragbar, das sagen die Leute vom MIT und ihre Kollegen selbst. Aber sie sind ein extrem ermutigender Schritt in die richtige Richtung: anscheinend sind wir nicht mehr so wahnsinnig weit davon entfernt, genetische Defekte in Menschen beheben zu können.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-1">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Seit der Veröffentlichung der CRISPR-CAS9-Studie im November 2013 ist weniger als ein halbes Jahr vergangen. Damals hatte ich schon vermutet, dass da einige irre Entwicklungen auf uns zukommen, allerdings hätte ich nicht damit gerechnet, dass es <em>so</em> schnell vorangeht!</p>

<h2 id="schädeldrucker">Schädeldrucker!</h2>
<p>Eine 22-jährige Frau leidet am seltenen van Buchem-Syndrom, einer Krankheit, die ihre Schädeldecke dicker und dicker macht. Statt der bei Erwachsenen üblichen 1.5 cm ist die Decke mittlerweile mehr als 3× so dick, gut 5 cm. In Folge wird ihr Hirn unter immer höheren Druck gesetzt, was zu starken chronischen Kopfschmerzen, schleichender Erblindung und Degeneration ihrer motorischen Fähigkeiten führt. Es ist klar, dass sie sterben wird, sollte das Wachstum des Knochens nicht gestoppt werden.</p>
<p>So geschehen im letzten Jahr in den Niederlanden.</p>
<p>In einer aufsehenerregenden Operation entschieden sich ihre Ärzte am University Medical Center in Utrecht dann zu einem drastischen/mutigen Schritt: sie entfernten die komplette Schädeldecke ihrer Patienten und ersetzten sie mit einem stabilen Kunststoff-Ersatz, der passgenau von einem 3D-Drucker hergestellt wurde. (Nettes Detail: das Teil ist transparent.) Danach wurde der Skalp wieder darübergezogen und befestigt.</p>
<p>In den drei Monaten seit ihrer OP hat sich die junge Frau komplett erholt. Ihre Beschwerden sind verschwunden, sie kann wieder sehen und geht wieder ihrer Arbeit nach. Und laut ihren Ärzten sieht man ihr auch so gut wie nicht an, dass sie eine solche OP hinter sich hat.</p>
<p>Wow. Einfach nur wow. :D</p>

<h2 id="lebendige-materialien">Lebendige Materialien</h2>
<p>Forscher am Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) haben ein neuartiges Material entwickelt, das Eigenschaften sowohl von organischem als auch anorganischem Leben aufweist. Dazu haben sie E.coli-Bakterien mit Gold-Nanopartikeln und Quantenpunkten “beladen”, um sie zu sog. “lebendigen Materialien” zu machen.</p>
<p>Bakterien organisieren sich selbständig und passen sich an ihre Umwelt an. Nicht-lebende Materialien können andere Sachen wie Strom leiten oder Licht abgeben. Die Kombination davon wären Hybridmaterialien, die z.B. für den Aufbau von komplexen Netzwerke für technische Anwendungen geeignet sind, und sich bei Beschädigungen selbst heilen können. Das wäre u.A. für die Herstellung neuer Biosensoren oder Solarzellen sehr praktisch. Die veränderten E.coli-Bakterien z.B. bildeten einen Biofilm, der mit den anorganischen Komponenten durchsetzt war — was Potential für die Entwicklung von neuen Batterietypen hat.</p>
<p>→ Nachricht bei <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/engineers-design-living-materials">MIT News: <em>“Engineers design ‘living materials’: Hybrid materials combine bacterial cells with nonliving elements that can conduct electricity or emit light.”</em></a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="rückrufaktion-stap">Rückrufaktion: STAP</h2>
<p>In Ausgabe #14 berichtete ich begeistert über eine neue Methode, um aus erwachsenen Zellen sog. STAP-Stammzellen herzustellen. Eine Forscherin aus Japan hatte eine Studie veröffentlicht, in der sie darlegte, wie sich besagte Zellen ausserhalb des Körpers innerhalb einer Stunde in pluripotente Stammzellen wandeln, setzt man sie nur Druck oder Stress aus. Die Veröffentlichung hatte mich und viele andere Menschen sehr geflasht, klang sie doch verdammt fantastisch.</p>
<p>Wie sich jetzt leider herauskristallisiert, scheint sie aber auch genau das zu sein: fantastisch, im Jules-Verne-Sinne. Als unabhängige Wissenschaftler das taten, was gute Wissenschaft ausmacht, nämlich die Studie im Labor nachstellen, konnte so gut wie keiner von ihnen die Erkenntnisse der Japaner verifizieren; schlimmer noch, es fanden sich einige Unregelmäßigkeiten, die auf die Manipulation der Daten des Papiers hinweisen.</p>
<p>Tja, doof, es wäre schön gewesen. Auf der anderen Seite freue ich mich natürlich, dass das gute alte Peer-Review noch lebt und funktioniert. Und die Autorin der Studie, die Biologin Haruko Obokata, schwört weiterhin, dass ihre Arbeit eine solide Basis hat, und sie STAP-Zellen produziert hat.</p>
<p>Der Keks ist also noch nicht komplett gegessen, die Untersuchungen des Falles dauern an.</p>

			 <p>Donnerstagmorgen sind dafür da, um die erste Woche Frühling Revue passieren zu lassen, und Bestnoten zu verweigern. Verdammt, Frühling, was soll der Blödsinn?

<h2 id="satelliten-aus-smartphones">Satelliten aus Smartphones</h2>
<p>Okay, nicht 100% aus Smartphones, aber: die US-Firma Planet Labs hat sich darauf spezialisiert, kleine Satelliten aus existierenden Hardware-Komponenten zu bauen, z.B. aus Teilen, die normalerweise in Smartphones Verwendung finden. Sie nennen das Prinzip <em>“agile aerospace”</em> (zu Deutsch <em>“agile Luft- und Raumfahrt”</em>), und schaffen es so, schnell und kostengünstig Nanosatelliten zu entwickeln und kontinuierlich zu verfeinern.</p>
<p>Wenn die Geräte an ihrem Einsatzort im Erdorbit angelangt sind, machen sie hochauflösende Fotos der Erdoberfläche. Seit Januar hat Planet Labs bereits 28 Satelliten im All (in ca. 400 km Höhe), deren Kameras eine Auflösung von 3-5 m haben. Aber das war nur der Anfang: die Firma hat vermeldet, dass sie in diesem Jahr mehr als 100 ihrer Cubesats ins All bringen werden — die Plätze sind gebucht, sowohl auf US- als auch russischen Raketen.</p>
<p>Planet Labs’ Ziel: mit allen Geräten im Einsatz kann die Firma ein “komplettes Bild” der Erde machen… pro Tag. Die Daten sollen Forschung und Wirtschaft mehr Datenpunkte geben, um bessere und nachhaltigere Entscheidungen zu treffen. Wieviel Wald wird tatsächlich täglich abgeholzt, welche Gebiete werden überfischt, wo drohen landwirtschaftliche Probleme usw.? Und das tagesaktuell! Wow.</p>
<p>(Mit etwas Glück werden dann auch die Satellitenbilder bei Google Maps &amp; Co. etwas besser — im Hinterland, wo meine Eltern wohnen, sieht aufgrund der niedrigen Auflösung alles nach Kiesgrube und Nachkriegszeit aus… ;))</p>
<p>Bonus-Link: die Firma Skybox Imaging verfolgt ein ähnliches Ziel, aber ihr Gebiet sind hochauflösende Videoaufnahmen aus dem All. Link zu einigen Vorzeigeaufnahmen gibts weiter unten.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Eine kleine, kommerziell agierende Firma, die ein einziges Office hat und gerade erst 4 Jahre alt ist, entwickelt Nanosatelliten und wird aller Voraussicht nach Ende 2014 schon mehr als 100 davon im Einsatz im All haben. Das so etwas tatsächlich möglich ist, finde ich faszinierend.</p>
<p>Übrigens: Mehr zu Cubesats gabs schon in <a href="https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues/6-ausgabe-6/blurbs/36-was-ich-meine-wenn-ich-von-newspace-spreche">NadZ #6, <em>“Was ich meine, wenn ich von ‘NewSpace’ spreche”</em></a>.</p>

<h2 id="gesicht-aus-dem-3d-drucker">Gesicht aus dem 3D-Drucker</h2>
<p>Der Brite Stephen Power hatte 2012 einen schweren Motorradunfall, in dem er sich nahezu alles im Gesicht brach, was zu brechen war: Nase, Kiefer, Wangenknochen, Augenhöhle, Schädel. In langwierigen Operationen stellten Chirurgen seine rechte Gesichthälfte wieder her. Die linke Hälfte war jedoch zu zertrümmert, ein zu kompliziertes Puzzle für die Mediziner, die befürchteten, bei einem Rekonstruktionsversuch mehr zu zerstören, als sie verantworten konnten.</p>
<p>Aber dann: Technologie! Power’s Schädel wurde gescannt, auf Basis dieser Scans wurde ein physikalisches 3D-Modell erstellt. An diesem wurden dann die Implantate konstruiert und Anleitungen entwickelt, die für die Wiederaufbau der Gesichtshälfte notwendig waren. Mit einem 3D-Drucker wurden diese personalisierten Implantate schließlich hergestellt, mit ihnen konnten die Ärzte die zweite Hälfte des Patientengesichts erfolgreich wiederherstellen.</p>
<p>Sein schwerer Unfall hat (wenig überraschend) mehr Schäden an Stephen Power’s Körper hinterlassen, und der Heilungsprozess ist nicht abgeschlossen — wenn das überhaupt möglich ist. Aber der Junge hat sein Gesicht wieder, er hat nicht mehr das Gefühl, sich verstecken zu müssen. Das ist doch ein schönes Zeugnis für diese noch recht junge Technologie.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-1">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>3D-Drucker sind dabei, einen festen Platz in der Chirurgie zu finden. Statt standardisierten Ersatzteilen kommen immer öfter personalisierte Implantate zum Einsatz. Dank der Drucker können sie schnell und nach Bedarf produziert werden, und geben Medizinern mehr Möglichkeiten beim “Reparieren” ihrer Patienten.</p>
<p>Sucht im Netz mal nach <em>“3d drucker medizin”</em> — die Ergebnisse sind verdammt interessant, das kann ich versprechen. :)</p>

<h2 id="schlanker-stärker-schöner-altern">Schlanker, stärker, schöner altern</h2>
<p>Forscher an der US-Uni Yale haben bei Mäusen, denen das FAT10-Gen herausgezüchtet wurde, einige interessante Veränderungen festgestellt: die Mäuse sahen jünger aus als ihre “naturbelassenen” Altersgenossen, lebten 20% länger, setzten ~50% weniger Körperfett an und hatten schöneres Fell und leistungsfähigere Muskeln.</p>
<p>Da sich DNA- und Proteinsequenzen des FAT10-Gens zwischen Mensch und Maus anscheinend nicht so sehr unterscheiden<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, sehen die Wissenschaftler ihre überraschenden Erkenntnisse als möglichen neuen Ansatz für neue Therapien an menschlichen Patienten. Yay!</p>

<h2 id="die-zukunft-der-hirnimplantate">Die Zukunft der Hirnimplantate</h2>
<p>Im <em>Wall Street Journal</em> erschien ein spekulativer und hochinteressanter Artikel von Dr. Gary Marcus und Christof Koch, ihres Zeichens Professor der Psychologie an der New York University (Dr. Marcus) und Chief Scientific Officer des Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle (Dr. Koch). Die Autoren beleuchten darin die mögliche bzw. wahrscheinliche Zukunft der Neuroimplantate.</p>
<p>Ihre Prognose: in den nächsten Jahrzehnten werden sich Neuroimplantate, die die Sinne ihres Besitzers schärfen oder ihm direkten Zugang zum Netz oder Computern bieten, zu einer Normalität entwickeln. Anfangs werden Implantate der Behebung und Linderung von Defekten oder der Unterstützung des Patienten bei Krankheiten dienen<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, aber mit den wachsenden Fähigkeiten der Technologie und unserem ebenso wachsenden Verständnis des Hirns wird der Übergang zum “Lifestyle-Produkt” unvermeidlich sein. Eine interessante (englischsprachige) Abhandlung!</p>
<p>Ich als Technikoptimist bekomme bei derlei Themen natürlich glänzende Augen, aber ich weiss auch, dass solche Entwicklungen und die damit verbundenen Eingriff ins “Menschsein” genug philosophischen, ethischen und auch religiösen Diskussionsstoff für Generationen liefern dürften. Wie ich schon sagte: hochinteressante Sache.</p>

<h2 id="human-longevity-inc">Human Longevity, Inc.</h2>
<p>Anfang März verkündete der US-Genetiker Dr. J. Craig Venter die Gründung seiner neuen Firma, Human Longevity, Inc. (HLI), deren Ziel es ist, die Forschung für ein längeres und gesünderes Leben voranzutreiben. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Zu diesem Zwecke wird HL die größte DNA-Sequenzierung der Geschichte angehen: pro Jahr sollen 40.000 menschliche Genome sequenziert und “kartographiert” werden.</p>
<p>Die so gewonnenen DNA-Datensätze werden dann mit vielen anderen Informationen zu Gesundheit und körperlicher Verfassung (der teilnehmenden Patienten) referenziert, um so (hoffentlich) den molekularen Gründen für das Altern und altersbedingten Krankheiten auf die Schliche zu kommen.</p>
<p>HLI’s grundlegende Vermutung ist, dass man, sollte man das Altern verlangsamen können, auch den damit verbundenen Krankheiten Einhalt gebieten könnte. Und mit solchen Informationen lässt sich Geld verdienen. (Der freie Markt etc.)</p>
<p>Ob diese Vermutung richtig ist, wird sich zeigen. Die wissenschaftlichen Daten, die in der Art gesammelt und ausgewertet werden, dürften unabhängig davon für Biologie und Genetik allein schon ihrer Breite wegen sehr interessant sein. Ich nenne sowas gern “Kollateralerkenntnisse”.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Erstens: die Kosten für eine einzelne Sequenzierung liegen mittlerweile bei weniger als $1.000; die Sequenzierung an sich dauert weniger als 24 Stunden. Laut National Human Genome Research Institute (USA) lagen die Kosten dafür im Jahr 2001 noch bei $100.000.000 (ja, <em>$100 Millionen</em>) und nahm mehrere Monate Zeit in Anspruch.</p>
<p>Zweitens: Die Idee ist nicht nur das Hirngespinst eines einzelnen Mannes. In der letzten Zeit sind mehrere Firmen gegründet würden, die das gleiche Ziel haben und/oder den gleichen Weg gehen. Dr. Venter geht davon aus, dass HLI’s 40.000 Scans pro Jahr nur der Anfang sind, und sein Team relativ bald auf 100.000 Sequenzierungen pro Jahr aufstocken können.</p>
<p>Der Wettlauf nimmt Fahrt auf. Das macht mich verdammt happy. :)</p>

<h2 id="drohnen-es-geht-auch-friedlich">Drohnen: es geht auch friedlich!</h2>
<p>Drohnen. Die meisten Menschen denken, wenn sie das Wort “Drohnen” hören, vermutlich an militärische “Tod von oben”-Einsätze in Ländern, die man nie selbst besuchen würde. Oder auch die totale Überwachung durch den Staat und/oder privatsphärenaushebelnde Schlimmfinger.</p>
<p>Aber Drohnen und UAVs <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> an sich, als Technologie, sollten keine Angst machen, haben sie doch ein gewaltiges Potential in vielen verschiedenen Einsatzfeldern, nicht nur dem militärischen. Genau wie andere technologische Entwicklungen in der Menschheitsgeschichte können sie unterschiedlich eingesetzt werden, und die Aggressions- bzw. Verteidigungsindustrie ist halt einfach sehr gut darin, neue Möglichkeiten zu erkennen und als erster Akteur schnell auszuloten. Ein gutes Beispiel dafür ist z.B. die Erfindung der Metallurgie: sie hat uns Schwerter gegeben, um “besser” Krieg führen zu können, klar. Aber später dann eben auch T-Träger für den Hausbau, Stahlkappen für Emo-Schuhwerk und ethisch unbedenkliche Löffel, um Nutella-Gläser auszukratzen.</p>
<p>In den letzten Wochen bin ich über zwei interessante, nicht-militärische Drohnen-Projekte gestolpert.</p>
<p>Zum einen haben die Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten (VAE) einen Wettbewerb mit einer Million USD Preisgeld gestartet, um ein <strong>Drohnen-basiertes Liefernetzwerk für Regierungsstellen</strong> aufzusetzen. Die Teilnehmer sollen zivile Drohnen entwickeln, die Dokumente zwischen Regierungsbehörden transportieren können. Die Lieferbehälter wären biometrisch gesichert, um Unbefugten den Zugang zu verwehren. Der Wettbewerb läuft im Mai aus, und die VAE gehen von einem 6-monatigen Test aus, an dessen Ende der reguläre Betrieb steht. Die Fluggeräte würden nicht autonom arbeiten, sondern von Piloten gesteuert werden.</p>
<p>Sollten sich das Projekt bewähren, könnte es nach Angaben der VAE-Regierung auf Verkehrsüberwachung und für wissenschaftliche Zwecke ausgedehnt werden.</p>
<p>Das zweite Projekt finde ich persönlich spannender, weil es sowohl technologisch als auch ethisch anspruchsvoller ist. Die US-Firma <strong>Matternet will ein Netzwerk von günstigen autonomen Liefer-Drohnen aufbauen, über das materielle Güter wie Medizin oder Nahrung schnell und kostengünstig transportiert werden können</strong>. Matternet’s Ansatz ist dabei erwähnenswert: anders als andere Startups und kleine Firmen setzen sie nicht auf den Luxusmarkt, in der Hoffnung, dass die Technologie irgendwann auch den ärmeren Bevölkerungsschichten zu Gute kommt. Im Gegenteil, Matternet geht dorthin, wo Not am Mann ist, wo Menschen auf Hilfe angewiesen sind, weil sie (vielleicht durch Katastrophen oder einfach aufgrund klimatischer Bedingungen) keine festen Straßen und Lieferwege haben, um Güter in entlegene Dörfer zu transportieren. Ihre Prototypen haben sie so bisher u.A. in Haiti und der Dominikanischen Republik getestet. Das macht wirtschaftlich kurzfristig vielleicht nicht soviel Sinn, aber Matternet-Mitgründerin Paola Santana drückt es so aus: <em>“Die Menschen, die diese Technologie am besten verstehen, sind die Menschen, die sie am dringensten benötigen.”</em></p>
<p>Da die Drohnen nur eine begrenzte Reichweite haben — Matternet’s UAVs schaffen derzeit ~20 km — wären die einzelnen Netzwerk-Stationen Umschlagplatz oder Tankstelle: eine Drohne landet, das Paket wird entweder an eine andere Drohne übergeben, oder es wird die Batterie getauscht, bevor es zur nächsten Station weitergeht. Dieses <em>Matternet</em> wäre dabei ähnlich robust wie das Internet aufgebaut: sollte eine Station ausfallen, würden Pakete einfach über eine andere geroutet werden.</p>
<p>Matternet ist ein schönes, sinnvolles, kapitales Projekt, vor dem ich meinen Hut ziehe! Ich finde es sinnvoller als Amazon’s “angekündigtes” Liefer-Drohnen-Programm, das im Dezember durch die Presse ging. Ich denke, die Meldung diente Amazon in erster Linie dazu, die US-Regulierungsbehörden aufzuwecken, damit sie ihnen entweder aus dem Weg gehen und/oder die ziemlich wirre Gesetzeslage in den Staaten (bzgl. UAVs) klären.</p>
<p>Der Wunsch ist allerdings berechtigt: weltweit stehen die meisten Staaten der zivilen Nutzung von Drohnen etwas hilf- und ratlos gegenüber, und reagieren entweder mit Überregulierung oder der Hoffnung, dass das Problem von allein verschwindet, wenn man es nur lang genug ignoriert. (Viel Glück damit.) Das Thema wird uns noch lang begleiten, und diese Technologie wird einige Industriezweige und Bereiche unseres Zusammenlebens umkrempeln.</p>
<p>A propos Überregulierung: ein (zugegebenermaßen heiteres) Beispiel dafür ist ein kleines kommerzielles Projekt aus den USA, das mittlerweile eingestellt werden musste: <em>Lakemaid</em> lieferte per Drohne Bier an Eisfischer in ihren Hütten auf dem zugefrorenen Mille-Lacs-See. Video und Link zum Artikel gibts wie immer etwas weiter unten.</p>

<h2 id="kugelförmige-solarkollektoren">Kugelförmige Solarkollektoren</h2>
<p>Der deutsche Architekt André Brößel hat einen Solarkollektor entwickelt, der auf einer transparenten Kugel basiert, die eingefangenes Licht auf eine relativ kleine photovoltaische Zelle fokussiert. Durch dieses Bündeln wird das Licht ca. 20.000× intensiver, und die Ausbeute der Zelle wird ungleich größer. Seine (etwas irritierend benannte) “Rawlemon”-Technologie soll es in verschiedenen Größen geben, ein <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/rawlemon-solar-devices">Crowdfunding-Projekt bei Indiegogo</a> ging mit 180% Backing überaus erfolgreich zuende, die Resonanz ist soweit sehr positiv … und ich bin auf erste echte Tests gespannt. :)</p>
<p>Bonus: aufgrund der beschriebenen Bündelung liefert die Technik auch bei bescheidenen Lichtverhältnissen (diesiges Wetter etc.) Strom — laut Brößel kann auch in klaren Mondnächten Energie erzeugt werden, wenn auch nur in sehr geringem Maße. Das hat doch mal echtes Potential!</p>

Im Rahmen der Initiative soll die existierende Lasertechnologie verfeinert werden, mit der der Schrott verfolgt und “kartografiert” wird; die Laser sollen dann aber in einer zweiten Phase verstärkt werden, um die Flugbahn der Teile zu beeinflussen, so dass sie in die Atmosphäre eintreten und dort harmlos verglühen. Als Zeitplan wurden die nächsten 10 Jahre angegeben.</p>

<h2 id="kernfusion-hurra">Kernfusion, hurra!</h2>
<p>Mit 192 Hochleistungslasern haben US-Forscher erstmalig eine Kernfusion erzeugt, die in sich mehr Energie freigesetzt hat, als ihre Erzeugung verbraucht hat. Fortschritt!</p>
<p>Aber so einfach ist das dann doch nicht. Die reine Energiemenge, die die Laser in Wasserstoffisotope pumpten, um deren Atomkerne zu verschmelzen, war tatsächlich niedriger als die Ausbeute. Und das ist auch ein großer Erfolg! Nur war diese Ausbeute halt dieses mal noch winzig: ~14 Kilojoule. Aber der gesamte Energieverbrauch der kompletten Anlage—mit ihren Lasern, Kondensatoren, Steuereinheiten, Computern etc.—war dabei noch ca. 28.000× größer als das Ergebnis. Anders gesagt: um 1 Energieeinheit zu erzeugen, mussten 28.000 Einheiten investiert werden. Man kann also sagen, dass es noch Optimierungsbedarf gibt.</p>
<p>Davon unberührt: der technische Prozess ist faszinierend. Die 192 Laser werden in eine Goldkapsel gefeuert, in der sich ein sog. Kunststoff-Pellet mit einem Durchmesser von 2 mm befindet. An den Innenwänden dieses Pellets ist der “Treibstoff” hauchdünn aufgetragen: eine Mischung aus Wasserstoffisotopen, Tritium und Deuterium. Wenn das Laserlicht jetzt auf die Goldkapsel trifft, gibt diese heftige Röntgenstrahlung ab, was wiederum das Pellet erhitzt und zur Implosion bringt. Um diesen Effekt zu erzielen, mussten die Laser im Nanosekundenbereich aufeinander abgestimmt werden. Irre.</p>
<p>Bitte nicht daheim nachmachen, Kinder!</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Kernfusion ist ein relativ alter Traum. Sie hat das Potential zur alternativen Form der Energieerzeugung, ohne CO2-Ausstoß während des Betriebs und weniger strahlendem Abfall als herkömmliche Reaktoren. Fusionsreaktoren liessen sich gefahrlos abschalten, was auch nicht uninteressant ist.</p>
<p>Ich <em>mag</em> neue alternative Energieformen, ich sehe sie als klaren Indikator für technischen Fortschritt. Im Jahr 1914 konnte sich sicher niemand vorstellen, auf Kohle zu verzichten, und die Idee, Atome zu spalten oder zu verdichten, oder auch den Sonnenschein “anzuzapfen”, waren Hirngespinste. Und kaum 100 Jahre später machen wir genau das und noch viel mehr. :)</p>

<h2 id="leben-ohne-puls">Leben ohne Puls</h2>
<p>Braucht der Mensch seinen Herzschlag? Die Frage klingt abwegig, ist sie interessanterweise aber gar nicht.</p>
<p>Herzunterstützende Systeme gibt es schon seit vielen Jahren. Die vermutlich bekanntesten Geräte dieser Gattung sind Herz-Lungen-Maschinen, aber es gibt auch kleinere Geräte, um dem geschwächten Herz eines Patienten unter die Arme zu greifen. Oft sind das sog. LVAD, <em>“left ventricular assist devices”</em>, Implantate zur Unterstützung der linken Herzkammern, die das mit Sauerstoff angereicherte Blut von der Lunge in den Rest des Körpers pumpen. Das Herz soll dadurch entlastet werden.</p>
<p>Das Problem dabei ist die Mechanik. Ein menschliches Herz schlägt pro Jahr ca. 35 Mio mal — das macht ihm auf Dauer kein mechanischer Ersatz nach. Vor ungefähr 30 Jahren kamen dann einige Mediziner auf die Idee, statt eines pumpenden Aufbaus einen reinen Durchflussmechanismus einzusetzen: das Blut wird durch eine sich kontinuierlich drehende Schraube auf Trab gebracht. Das funktioniert seither recht gut, diese “Triebwerke” sind langlebiger und mechanisch wenig anfällig. Fortschritte wurden gemacht, die Überlebenschancen der auf ein Spenderorgan wartenden Patienten wurden stark erhöht.</p>
<p>Aber die Geräte sind nur als sog. Brückentechnologie gedacht, zur Überbrückung der kurzen Zeit, bis der Patient (hoffentlich) ein Ersatzorgan erhält. Eigentlich. Vor ca. 10 Jahren, im November 2003 aber passierte etwas Heiteres.</p>
<p>Einem jungen Mann aus Zentralamerika wurde in den USA ein LVAD vom Typ <em>Thoratec HeartMate II</em> implantiert. Der Herr sprach nur gebrochen Englisch, seine Familie verstand die Sprache gar nicht. Die Information, dass regelmäßige Nachuntersuchungen wichtig sind, ging daher an ihm vorbei; er verließ nach seiner Operation das Krankenhaus …und kam erstmal nicht zurück.</p>
<p>Erst nach 8 Monaten tauchte er wieder auf, gesund und munter. Er war aufgrund fehlender Probleme mit dem Implantat einfach nicht auf die Idee gekommen, sich regelmäßig untersuchen zu lassen. <strong>Als sein Arzt ihn untersuchte, stellte er überrascht fest, dass sein Patient keinen Puls mehr hatte.</strong> Weitere Untersuchungen ergaben dann recht schnell, dass das Herz des Mannes die Arbeit eingestellt hatte — sein eigentlich nur zur Unterstützung vorgesehenes Implantat hatte irgendwann in den 8 Monaten einfach komplett übernommen.</p>
<p>Wie sich seitdem in weiteren Studien, Experimenten und im Einsatz zeigte, sind LVADs weitaus hilfreicher, als ihre Erfinder sich vorgestellt haben. In vielen Fällen erholte sich das so unterstützte Herz nach einer Weile, und das LVAD konnte entfernt werden. Und mittlerweile existiert eine kleine Anzahl von Menschen, die komplett ohne Herzschlag herumlaufen.</p>
<p>Und ein Kalb namens Meeko, das ich im Intro dieser Ausgabe erwähnte. :)</p>
<p>In den letzten Jahren sind ca. 16.000 der <em>HeartMate II</em>-Geräte implantiert worden, davon über 1000 in Deutschland, dazu kommen viele Tausend Implantate, die einen anderen Namen tragen. Sicher, die Besitzer würden sich sicher noch mehr über ein gesundes Organ freuen; sie müssten dann nicht ständig ein kleines Batteriepack plus Steuereinheit in der Größe einer Videokassette mit sich herumtragen<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, oder auf Infektionen an den Anschlüssen achten etc. — aber ich denke, das ist einem vorzeitigen Ableben vorzuziehen.</p>
<p>Der Vollständigkeit halber sollte ich aber auch erwähnen, dass die <em>HeartMate II</em>-Modelle von Thoratec in den letzten Monaten durch die Presse gegangen sind, weil es seit März 2011 ein höheres Thrombose-Risiko gegenüber den vorhergegangenen Jahren gibt (8,4% vs. 2,2%). Hersteller und unabhängige Institute sind noch auf der Suche nach den Ursachen.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-1">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Das Hinterfragen von anscheinend klaren Sachverhalten ( <em>“Muss ein Herz wirklich schlagen bzw. rhythmisch pumpen?”</em>) produziert manchmal erstaunliche Ergebnisse, die uns als Spezies weiterbringen können. Menschen ohne Puls wären früher vermutlich gepfählt und mit Knoblauch überhäuft begraben worden, heute ist die Forschung hocherfreut über ihre Existenz. ;)</p>

<h2 id="ein-hörgerät-kleiner-als-eine-erbse">Ein Hörgerät, kleiner als eine Erbse</h2>
<p>Stell’ Dir ein Hörgerät vor, ein handelsübliches Hörgerät. Ein Stöpsel im Ohr, ein Batteriepack hinter dem Ohr. Die Batterien müssen ca. alle 2 Wochen aufgeladen werden. Das komplette Gerät kannst Du je nach Frisur gut oder weniger gut verstecken. Siehst Du es vor Dir? Super.</p>
<p>Jetzt stell Dir vor, das Ganze ist nur 4×4×1mm groß und benötigt einen Bruchteil der Energie. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Genau das hat das Fraunhofer-Institut in Berlin jetzt vorgestellt. Ihr Projekt, Teil der WiserBAN-Initiative der Europäischen Union, integriert 19 verschiedene Komponenten in einem sog. Mikromodul-Hörgerät. Das Gerät ist 50× kleiner als existierende Modelle und gehört zur Gattung der sog. BAN-Anwendungen ( <em>“Body Area Network”</em>, Körpernetzwerk) — also Elektronik, die für den Einsatz direkt am oder im Körper vorgesehen ist.</p>
<p>Die WiserBAN-Teilnehmer entwickeln diverse Bausteine — Hardware wie z.B. Antennen oder auch Software wie Protokolle für Datenübertragung —, die in unterschiedlichen Systemen zum Einsatz kommen (sollen). Das umfasst sowohl konkrete Hilfen wie solche Hörgeräte als auch Sensormodule, die z.b. Blutzucker und -druck oder Herzschlag messen und drahtlos an den behandelnden Mediziner übermitteln können.</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht-2">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Derlei Mikrosysteme finde ich faszinierend, weil ich eine relativ gerade Linie zwischen den Geräten der Vergangenheit, Entwicklungen wie dem des Fraunhofer Instituts und zukünftigen Implantatsystemen erkennen kann. Ein integriertes, im Körper verteiltes Sensornetzwerk, das mir dabei helfen kann, länger fit und unabhängig und gesund zu bleiben? Will ich.</p>

<h2 id="es-gibt-ihn-doch-den-guten-stress">Es gibt ihn doch, den guten Stress…</h2>
<p>…zumindest in der Stammzellenforschung.</p>
<p>Was Haruko Obokata und ihre Kollegen vom RIKEN-Zentrum für Entwicklungsbiologie in Kobe, Japan, in den letzten fünf Jahren Forschung herausgefunden haben, überraschte Ende Januar Biologen weltweit. Die Japaner entnahmen Mäusen Blut- und Hautzellen, und setzten diese ausserhalb des Körpers kurzzeitigem Stress aus—wie z.B. einem leichten Säurebad, Hitze oder mechanischem Druck. Die Zellen verwandelten sich daraufhin zu pluripotenten Stammzellen, also Zellen, aus denen viele andere Gewebetypen entstehen, u.A. Hirn, Herz, Lunge, Haut, Knochen etc.</p>
<p>Zwei Dinge beeindrucken an ihrer neuen Methode. Erstens, dass sie komplett ohne das Einschleusen von Genen durch Retroviren auskommt, das bei “herkömmlichen” Methoden wie der künstlichen Reprogrammierung eingesetzt wird (siehe <a href="https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues/1-ausgabe-1/blurbs/3-stammzellen-forschung-jetzt-mit-weniger-petrischalen">NadZ #1, <em>“Stammzellen-Forschung: Jetzt mit weniger Petrischalen”</em></a>). Und zweitens, dass die Stress-Prozedur weniger als eine Stunde in Anspruch nimmt! (Das Säurebad dauerte ungefähr 30 min.)</p>
<p>Die so gewonnenen STAP-Zellen <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> lassen sich genau wie embryonale Stammzellen im Labor nahezu unbegrenzt vermehren, und das ohne ethische Bedenken. Sie entwickelten sich, als sie wieder in die Mäusekörper eingeschleust wurden, zu normalem Gewebe und Organen.</p>
<p>Chris Mason, Lehrstuhl für Bioprocessing in der regenerativen Medizin am University College London, der nicht an der Studie beteiligt war, bezeichnete die Technik als <em>“die einfachste, kostengünstigste und schnellste Methode”</em> für die Erzeugung von pluripotenten aus erwachsenen Zellen. <em>“Sollte [diese Technik] für Menschen funktionieren, könnte sie der</em> game changer <em>sein, der dann unterschiedlichste Zelltherapien ermöglicht, die des Patienten eigene Zellen als Anfangsmaterial nutzen—das Zeitalter der personalisierten Medizin wäre endlich angebrochen.”</em></p>
<p>Bisher wurde die neue Technik nur erfolgreich mit Zellen von Nagern getestet. Laut Haruko Obokata laufen u.A. aber Labor-Experimente mit menschlichen Zellen, und unabhängige Labore überprüfen die neue Technik generell auf Herz und Nieren. Man darf gespannt sein!</p>
<p>Lustige Randnotiz: Obokata’s Studie wurde mehrfach für die Veröffentlichung abgelehnt. Erst, als sie mehrere verlangte Gegenproben erbracht hatte, konnte sie ihre Kollegen dazu bringen, ihre Ergebnisse nicht als Hirngespinst oder Fabrikation abzutun. Hartnäckigkeit zahlt sich halt doch aus. :)</p>
<h3 id="was-mich-daran-happy-macht">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>
<p>Wenn diese Technik in Menschen anwendbar wäre, könnten im Labor schnell und sicher Stammzellen aus den erwachsenen Zellen von Patienten erzeugt werden. Auf relativ kurze Sicht hiesse das, dass z.B. bei Herzproblemen kostengünstig in der Petrischale Herzzellen des jeweiligen Patienten gezüchtet werden könnten, die das Durchspielen von personalisierten Behandlungsmöglichkeiten erlauben würden—welche Medikamente sprechen an, welche sind schädlich? Und das ohne “Live-Tests” am vermutlich ohnehin schon geschwächten Patienten.</p>

<h2 id="handprothesen-mit-gespür">Handprothesen mit Gespür</h2>
<p>Vor neun Jahren verlor der Däne Dennis Aabo Sørensen durch einen Unfall seine Hand, seitdem ist er auf eine Prothese angewiesen. Vor Kurzem ging seine Name durch die Presse, als er im Rahmen einer Studie zum ersten Menschen wurde, der erfolgreich eine Prothese mit sog. Rückkanal testete, die nicht nur Handbewegungen zulässt, sondern auch Sinnesempfindungen an den Träger zurückliefert.</p>
<p>Wissenschaftler der Eidgenössischen Technischen Hochschule (Lausanne, Schweiz) und vom Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna (Pisa, Italien) implantierten ihm dafür Elektroden in den Oberarm, über die die mit Sensoren ausgestattete künstliche Hand Berührungs- und Druck-Daten an sein Gehirn übermittelte. Das Bindeglied zwischen Sensoren und Elektroden ist ein Gerät, dass die sensorischen Informationen in Nervenimpulse umwandelt. <strong>Damit konnte Sørensen in einem Blindtest im Labor Aussagen über Art, Form und Beschaffenheit der gegriffenen Gegenstände treffen.</strong></p>
<p>Das Team um Prof. Silvestro Micera, dessen Entwicklungen der Däne testete, ist stolz auf den Erfolg. Bevor das Gerät Marktreife erlangt, müssen es die Forscher nach eigenen Angaben aber noch miniaturisieren, und Permanent-Implantat-Versionen der Elektroden entwickeln. Und sie denken über sensorische Erweiterungen nach, um z.B. Texturen oder auch Temperatur erkennen und übermitteln zu können.</p>
<p>Sørensen, der nach eigenen Angaben überwältigt war, nach vielen Jahren mit “seiner” linken Hand wieder spüren zu können, hat mittlerweile seine alte Prothese zurück. Er hofft darauf, dass diese Technologie bald eine EU-Zulassung bekommt, damit er sie täglich benutzen kann. Bis dahin steht er—nach eigener Aussage—für eventuelle weitere Versuche im Labor bereit. Guter Mann!</p>

<p>Künstliche Extremitäten, die ebenso leistungsfähig und empfindsam wie die Originale sind, oder gar besser, was kann man an dieser Idee nicht mögen? Davon sind wir zwar noch ein paar Jahr(zehnt)e entfernt, aber der Gedanke, dass Menschen beim Verlust von Gliedmaßen nach Unfällen o.Ä. eben nicht zwangsläufig auf Rollstuhl oder Krücken angewiesen sein müssen, ist doch ziemlich cool. Und zu <em>fühlen</em>, was Deine neue Hand tut, ohne hinschauen zu müssen—ich denke, das ist zwingend notwendig, um sie als “Deine” Hand zu akzeptieren.</p>

<h2 id="nanomotoren-in-lebenden-zellen">Nanomotoren in lebenden Zellen</h2>
<p>Chemiker und Techniker an der Pennsylvania State University, USA, haben synthetische Nanomaschinen in lebende menschlichen Zellen eingeschleust (zum ersten Mal überhaupt!), und sie mit Ultraschall und Magneten zur Arbeit bewegt.</p>
<p>Die winzigen Maschinchen sind simpel aufgebaut; sie sind stabförmig, bestehen aus Gold und Ruthenium, haben einen Durchmesser von ~3 µm im Durchmesser und eine Länge von ~300 nm. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Die Wissenschaftler können sie mit Ultraschall und Magneten steuern, sie in den Zellen frei bewegen und in verschiedenen Geschwindigkeiten rotieren—schneller oder langsamer, je nachdem, wie stark die Ultraschallwellen sind. Dadurch können sie wahlweise untätig und schadlos in den Zellen herumschwimmen, oder Zellmembranen durchdringen, oder aber das Innere der Zellen pürieren.</p>
<p>Prof. Tom Mallouk (Materialchemie und Physik an der PSU) sagte, diese Studie zeige sehr gut, <em>”[…] dass synthetische Nanomotoren möglicherweise neue Wege bieten, um Einblicke in die Zellbiologie zu erlangen. Wir können vielleicht Krebs und andere Krankheiten behandeln, indem wir mechanische Änderungen am Inneren der Zellen vornehmen. Nanomotoren könnten intrazelluläre Chirurgie durchführen und Medizin nichtinvasiv in lebendes Gewebe transportieren.”</em></p>

			 <p>Na, das hat ja gut geklappt mit dem <em>“Ich bin Mitte Januar wieder da”</em>—der Jänner ist nahezu vorbei, wir sind alle in 2014 angekommen. Ein Jahr näher an der Zukunft, OMG! :P</p>
<p>Mein Jahr begann gut: wie in <a href="https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues/12-ausgabe-12">der letzten Ausgabe</a> angekündigt, habe ich in den letzten paar Wochen zusammen mit meinem guten Freund, Entwickler, Berater, intergalaktischem Weltraumhelden und DJ <a href="http://mans.de/">Hendrik</a> die Technik hinter <strong>NadZ</strong> komplett neugeschrieben. Und hui, die Zukunft sieht jetzt noch toller aus! Das neue System erlaubt es mir nicht nur, Newsletter wie bisher zu verschicken, nein, jede Ausgabe erscheint zeitgleich auch im Web. Wie zum Beispiel <a href="https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues/13-ausgabe-13">diese hier</a>, die Ihr gerade lest. (Und ja, es gibt auch einen <a href="https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues.atom">RSS-Feed</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Aber keine Panik, liebe Leser, für Euch ändert sich erstmal gar nichts.</strong> Wenn Ihr die neuen Ausgabe weiterhin per Email erhalten wollt, bleibt alles beim Alten. Am Donnerstagmorgen machts weiterhin “pling”, und DIE TOLLE ZUKUNFT schwappt aus der Inbox. Aber etwas feiner sieht der Newsletter jetzt schon aus.</p>
<p>Wenn Ihr dagegen die neue Ausgabe lieber im Browser lesen wollt, so geht das jetzt noch komfortabler als vorher. <a href="https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/">Die neue Website</a> sieht nur auf den ersten Blick aus wie die alte (ich habe auf der Frontpage die Aufteilung grob beibehalten), aber spätestens beim <a href="https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues">Blick ins Archiv</a> dürfte klar sein, dass ich <em>ein wenig</em> an der Site gearbeitet habe. :) <strong>Ein komplett neuer Look fürs Archiv und die Artikel</strong>, mit aufgeräumter Typographie, schöner Darstellung von Fußnoten, einer Kleinfamilie mit Hund in einer fliegenden Untertasse und klareren Optionen fürs Weiterempfehlen. (Ab jetzt können nicht nur komplette Ausgaben geteilt werden, sondern auch gezielt einzelne Meldungen—auf Twitter, Facebook, Google+ und per Mail.) Und die Site ist jetzt auch gut lesbar auf kleineren Screens, d.h. sowohl auf dem Laptop als auch auf dem Smartphone, es bleibt schick.</p>
<p>So, das war zum technischen Kurzabriss. Und wir sind noch lange nicht fertig—in den nächsten Monaten wird da noch Einiges passieren. :)</p>
<p><strong>Und es gibt noch eine Änderung.</strong> Wie ich in <a href="https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues">den letzten Ausgaben</a> schon erwähnt habe, entpuppte mein selbst gestellter Wochenrhythmus doch als etwas zu ambitioniert. Aus diesem Grund <strong>erscheint <em>Neues aus der Zukunft</em> ab jetzt alle 14 Tage</strong>. Das gibt mir mehr Zeit für die einzelnen Ausgaben, was sowohl meinem Nervenkostüm als auch der Qualität gut tun dürfte.</p>
<p>So, das war mal ein langes Editorial! Wenn Ihr Fragen, Meinungen oder Kritik zu den Änderungen oder der aktuellen Ausgabe haben solltet, <a href="mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de">schreibt mir eine Mail</a>! Ich mag Feedback—daran ändert sich auch dieses Jahr nichts. :)</p>
<p>Geniesst den Rest des Januars. Bis in zwei Wochen,</p>

<h2 id="585960--20">…—58—59—60 … 20?</h2>
<p>Kurz vor Weihnachten ging eine Studie der Harvard Medical School, USA, und der Universität von New South Wales, Australien, durch die Fachpresse. Es wurde eine Ursache für das Altern in Säugetieren gefunden, die potentiell rückgängig gemacht werden kann.</p>
<p>In ihren Untersuchungen an Mäusen stellten die Forscher fest, dass mit zunehmendem Alter die Kommunikation innerhalb ihrer Zellen nachliess. Je mehr sie nachliess, desto schneller alterten die Tiere. Sie verabreichten den Mäusen daraufhin ein Molekül, das im menschlichen Körper natürlich produziert wird, und das Kommunikationsnetzwerk in älteren Nagern wurde wiederhergestellt.</p>
<p>Das Team um David Sinclair, Professor für Genetik an der Harvard Medical School, entdeckte einen komplexen Ablauf in Zellen, der mit einer Chemikalie namens NAD beginnt und mit einem Molekül endet, das die Aktivitäten zwischen dem Zell- und dem mitochondrialen Genom koordiniert. So lange der Informationsfluss zwischen den Genomen reibungslos funktioniert, bleiben die Zellen und ihre Abwehrmechanismen gesund. Mit fortschreitendem Alter des Organismus nimmt auch der NAD-Level ab, und in Folge verschlechtert sich diese Kommunikation. Wenn sie zu sehr ins Stocken gerät, nimmt die Produktion der Mitochondrien ab (die Energieerzeuger der Zellen), und die Anzeichen von Alterung mehren sich.</p>
<p>Warum der NAD-Level nach und nach schwindet, ist noch unklar. Was passiert, wenn man älteren Mäusen einen körpereigenen Stoff <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> zuführt, den ihre Zellen in NAD umwandeln, ist jetzt dagegen bekannt: nach ca. 1 Woche Behandlung, in denen 2-jährige Mäuse diesen Stoff verabreicht bekamen, war ihr Muskelgewebe wieder auf einem Stand wie bei 6 Monate alten Mäusen. <strong>Auf Menschen übertragen wären das 60-Jährige mit der Muskelkraft von 20-Jährigen.</strong> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Dr. Nigel Turner, einer der Co-Autoren der Studie, sagte dem <em>Guardian</em> in einem Interview, dass eine “magische Tablette”, die das Alter zurückdreht, noch einige Jahre auf sich warten lassen wird, schon allein wegen der Kosten—derzeit würde eine Tagesdosis des besagten Stoffes für einen Menschen um die $50.000 kosten.</p>
<p><em>“Die Leute denken, dass es bei der sog. Anti-Aging-Forschung darum geht, Menschen 200 Jahre alt werden zu lassen, aber das Ziel ist eigentlich, ihnen dabei zu helfen, bis ins hohe Alter hinein fitter und gesünder zu leben”</em>, sagte Turner. Der Fokus dieses Forschungsprojekts lag auf Muskeln, aber könnte seiner Aussage nach möglicherweise bei verschiedenen anderen Organen zur Anwendung kommen, und helfen, viele Krankheiten wie Krebs, Demenz und Typ-2-Diabetes zu verzögern oder zu verhindern.</p>
<p>Die Wissenschaftler denken, noch dieses Jahr mit klinischen Tests beginnen zu können.</p>

<h2 id="blutzuckermessung-durch-kontaktlinsen">Blutzuckermessung durch Kontaktlinsen</h2>
<p>Vor knapp zwei Wochen machte Google Furore, als sie verkündeten, an der Entwicklung einer elektronischen Kontaktlinse für Diabetiker zu arbeiten. Der Winzling ist nicht größer als eine herkömmliche Linse und besteht aus einem winzigen Chip und einem miniaturisierten Glucose-Sensor, die zwischen zwei Schichten weichem Kontaktlinsenmaterial eingebettet sind. <strong>Damit kann die Linse den Blutzuckerspiegel in der Tränenflüssigkeit ihres Trägers messen.</strong></p>
<p>Diabetes wird durch Insulin-Mangel hervorgerufen; 5% der Bevölkerung in den sog. entwickelten Staaten leidet daran. Die Krankheit kann Erblindung, Nierenversagen oder auch notwendige Amputationen nach sich ziehen, wenn sie nicht ausreichend behandelt wird.</p>
<p>Laut eigenen Angaben testet Google derzeit Prototypen der Kontaktlinsen, die einmal pro Sekunde die Glucose-Werte auslesen; eine Schnittstelle zum kabellosen Auslesen der Daten sind geplant; des Weiteren untersuchen sie, ob man nicht auch kleine LEDs einbetten könnte, die dem Träger als “Frühwarnsystem” dienen könnten, sollten bestimmte Schwellenwerte über- oder unterschritten werden.</p>
<p>Google sucht jetzt nach Partnern, um die Linsen marktreif zu machen (und um medizinische Tests und Zulassungen dafür zu bekommen).</p>
<p>Eine schöne Entwicklung, die aber nicht ohne Kritiker ist. Der Journalist Om Malik, selbst Diabetiker, warf die Frage auf, <em>wem</em> am Ende die Technologie zur Verfügung stehen würde, zumal sie nicht ganz günstig sein dürfte. Seiner Meinung nach wäre eine massentauglichere, billigere, simplere Variante—auch für den Einsatz in weniger entwickelten Orten der Erde—ein sinnvolleres Unterfangen. Und nicht zuletzt rieten ohnehin viele Ärzte Patienten mit Diabetes davon ab, Kontaktlinsen zu tragen, da die Krankheit die Empfindlichkeit der Augen erhöhen kann und Linsen zu schweren Reizungen mit Entzündungen etc. führen können.</p>
<p>Tolle Technologie, schwieriges Thema. Aber ich als Freund der sog. <em>Quantified Self</em>-Bewegung <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> sehe derartige Entwicklungen als demokratisierend an. Je mehr Daten man selbst sammeln kann, desto besser kann man Ursache/Wirkung beobachten und sich möglicherweise auch ohne Mediziner weiterhelfen. In einer Zeit, in der die meisten Blutzuckermessgerät immer noch keinen Export der gesammelten Daten durch den Patienten zulassen (!), wirkt allein schon Google’s implizierte Ankündigung einer offenen Schnittstelle revolutionär. Bin gespannt, in welche Richtung sich diese Entwicklung bewegt.</p>

<h2 id="batterien-aus-zucker">Batterien aus Zucker</h2>
<p>Forscher an der Virginia Tech Universität, USA, haben ihr Konzept für Batterien aus Zucker vorgestellt, die eine zehnmal so hohe Energiedichte wie herkömmliche Batterien haben. Kein Scherz.</p>
<p>Die <em>ganz</em> kurze Zusammenfassung: die Wissenschaftler haben eine Technik entwickelt, bei der unter Zuhilfenahme von synthetischen Enzymen den Glukose-Molekülen nach und nach die Energie entlockt wird; der Hauptabfallstoff dieses Prozesses ist Wasser. (Für eine wesentlich detailliertere Erklärung kann ich den Artikel der Kollegen bei ScienceBlogs empfehlen—Link weiter unten.)</p>
<p><em>“Zucker ist der perfekte Energiespeicher der Natur”</em>, sagt Y.H. Percival Zhang, Professor für biologische System-Konstruktion <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> am Virginia Tech. <em>“Daher ist es nur logisch zu versuchen, diese natürlichen Fähigkeiten für die umweltfreundliche Produktion von Batterien zu verwenden.”</em> Seiner Einschätzung nach könnten die neuen Speicher in weniger als drei Jahren marktreif sein, und dann in Mobiltelefonen, Schrittmachern, Laptops etc. etc. verbaut werden.</p>
<p>Zhang hatte durch seine Arbeit mit seinen künstlichen Enzymen schon öfter von sich reden gemacht; u.A. im letzten Jahr mit der Erzeugung essbarer Stärke aus Zellulose, die aus nicht-essbaren Pflanzen gewonnen wurde.</p>
<p>Weltweit werden jährlich Milliarden von giftigen Batterien und Akkus weggeworfen, was ziemlich furchtbar für die Umwelt ist. Akkus, die länger halten als existierende Modelle, und die man austrinken kann, wenn sie leer sind, oder mit handelsüblichem Zucker wieder aufladen, würden helfen. :)</p>

<h2 id="synthetisches-molekül-stoppt-hiv-1">Synthetisches Molekül stoppt HIV-1</h2>
<p>In einem Projekt in Spanien, an dem mehrere Forschungseinrichtungen und Universitäten beteiligt waren, haben kluge Menschen in Laborkitteln ein synthetisches Molekül entwickelt, welches das AIDS-Virus daran hindert, sich zu vervielfältigen. Das Molekül hält das Virus davon ab, sein genetisches Material auf die infizierten Zellen abzugeben—die Infektion weiterer Zellen wird damit verhindert, und das Virus stirbt sozusagen aus.</p>
<p>Das Molekül und seine Fähigkeiten wurden am Computer entworfen und erfolgreich simuliert, und erst später im Labor bestätigt, was bis jetzt auf diesem Feld wohl noch nie erreicht wurde.</p>
<p>Über eventuell geplante klinische Tests konnte ich noch nichts in Erfahrung bringen—also bitte immer schön weiter an Verhütung denken. ;)</p>

<h2 id="gentherapie-besiegt-leukämie">Gentherapie besiegt Leukämie</h2>
<p>Seit einigen Jahren behandeln Mediziner in den USA Leukämie-Patienten, die nicht mehr viele Optionen haben, mit einer experimentellen Gentherapie. Dazu werden dem Patienten Millionen von weißen Blutzellen entnommen (sog. T-Zellen), und im Labor genverändert, so dass sie Krebszellen angreifen. Danach werden sie dem Körper wieder zugeführt.</p>
<p>In einer der Studien wurden 27 Patienten mit akuter lymphatischer Leukämie dieser Therapie unterzogen. Bei 19 der 22 Kinder sowie allen 5 Erwachsenen konnte nach der Therapie kein Krebs mehr festgestellt werden. (Bei einigen ist er seitdem allerdings zurückgekehrt, und die Doktoren erwägen eine zweite “Runde”.)</p>
<p>Diese Patienten waren todkrank und hatten keine weiteren Möglichkeiten mehr. Einige von ihnen hatten schon mehrere Knochenmarkspenden erhalten, einige bis zu 10 verschiedene Arten von Chemotherapie. In der 8-jährigen Emily Whitehead aus Philipsburg, Pennsylvania (USA), war der Krebs so aggressiv und weit fortgeschritten, dass ihre Ärzte von Organversagen innerhalb weniger Tage ausgingen, bevor sie die experimentelle Gentherapie begann. Das war vor 2 Jahren. Emily’s genveränderte T-Zellen haben den Kampf gewonnen, die Kleine ist geheilt.</p>
<p>Bis jetzt haben sich über 120 Patienten mit unterschiedlichen Arten von Blut- und Knochenmarkkrebs dieser Art der Therapie unterzogen, mit teils atemberaubenden Ergebnissen.</p>

<h2 id="selbstheilende-batterien">Selbstheilende Batterien</h2>
<p>Wissenschaftler haben die erste Batterie-Elektrode entwickelt, die über “Selbstheilungsfähigkeiten” verfügt, und damit potentiell einen Generationswechsel auf dem Feld der Lithium-Ionen-Batterien und -Akkus eingeläutet. Das dürfte die Hersteller von elektrischen Fahrzeugen oder auch Smartphones sehr interessieren. Das “Geheimnis” der neuen Elektrode ist ein dehnbares Polymer, mit dem sie überzogen ist und das die winzigen Risse heilen kann, die üblicherweise entstehen, wenn eine Batterie benutzt wird.</p>
<p>In ihren Tests zeigten Polymer-behandelte Silikonelektroden ihr immenses Potential: ihre Lebensdauer wuchs aufs 10-fache—nach über ~100 Ladezyklen wiesen sie keinen nennenswerten Kapazitätsverlust auf. Zum Vergleich: der Akku eines neuen MacBook Air ist mit max. 1000 Zyklen angegeben, spätestens danach ist der Akku hinüber.</p>

<h2 id="a-bisserl-mehr-ist-auch-okay">A bisserl mehr ist auch okay</h2>
<p>Lebkuchen, Stollen, Dominosteine, die Gans und Klöße und die leckeren Plätzchen—so sollte Weihnachten doch sein! Aber der prüfende Zangengriff in den Bauchspeck verdirbt den Genuss. Denn natürlich wissen wir alle, das Übergewicht ungesund ist und “dick” ein Synonym ist für “faul” und “willensschwach”. Gerade um die Feiertage herum blühen in den diversen Herren- und Frauenmagazinen die Diättipps. <em>“Schlank durch die Feiertage”</em> oder <em>“Bis Weihnachten 2 kg abnehmen”</em> heisst es da diese Woche.</p>
<p>Eigentlich könnte aber seit vier Jahren bekannt sein, dass Übergewicht nicht unbedingt eine schlechte Sache ist. Da erschien im Deutschen Ärzteblatt eine Meta-Studie, die zu dem verblüffenden Ergebnis kam, dass Krankheitshäufigkeit und Sterblichkeit bis zu einem <em>Body Mass Index</em> (BMI) von 30g/kg² nicht höher sind als bei “normalgewichtigen” Menschen. Ausgewertet wurden dabei 27 Meta- und 15 Kohortenanalysen—also Studien, die Studien zusammenfassen. Der mittlerweile nicht mehr übliche BMI war lange das Mittel der Wahl, um Übergewicht und Fettleibigkeit zu definieren. Man ist z.B. mit 86 kg bei einer Körpergröße von 170 cm noch unter einem BMI von 30.</p>
<p>Vielleicht ist es also immer noch nicht das Schlaueste, sich bis Neujahr nur von Fett und Zucker zu ernähren, aber von wissenschaftlicher Seite stehen Zimtstern und Glühwein nicht <em>so viel</em> im Wege.</p>

			 <p>Donnerstagmorgen sind dafür da, um die Feuerzangenbowle beim Frühstück vor der Ehefrau mit <em>“Aber wir haben keinen Kaffee mehr im Haus”</em> zu rechtfertigen. (Und damit zu scheitern.)</p>
<p>Diese Woche gibt es Beeindruckendes aus der Hirnforschung, eine genetische Abnehmhilfe, Neues aus der Stammzellenforschung, einen Überraschungserfolg im Kampf gegen HIV, Gentherapie gegen Herzschwäche, und etwas Hochprozentiges. Eine feine Mischung! Mein Dank geht auch diese Woche wieder an Gastoptimist <a href="mailto:wunderlich@witzmacher.com">Oliver Wunderlich</a> für seine schöne Meldung zur Gesellschaft.</p>
<p>Oh, meine Bowle ist heiss! Viel Spaß mit dieser Ausgabe #11. Bei Fragen, Themenvorschlägen, Lob oder Kritik <a href="mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de">schreib mir eine Mail</a> oder <a href="https://twitter.com/municode">einen Tweet</a>! Ich mag Feedback.</p>
<p>Bis nächste Woche,</p>

<h2 id="schrittmacher-fürs-hirn">Schrittmacher fürs Hirn</h2>
<p>Die US-amerikanische <em>Food and Drug Administration</em> (FDA, die Lebensmittelüberwachungs- und Arzneimittelzulassungsbehörde) hat dem sog. “NeuroPace RNS® System” die medizinische Zulassung erteilt. Dabei handelt es sich um einen Neurostimulator für Epileptiker. Das Gerät wird unter die Schädeldecke des Patienten implantiert, und überwacht die elektrischen Aktivitäten in den Teilen des Gehirns, die für die epileptische Krampfanfälle verantwortlich sind. Wenn es dort Unregelmäßigkeiten wahrnimmt, liefert es eine nicht wahrnehmbare elektrische Stimulation, um diese Störungen zu normalisieren.</p>
<p>Die FDA stellte in ihrem 3-monatigen Tests fest, dass knapp ein Drittel der überwachten Patienten einen Rückgang ihrer Anfälle um 50% erfuhr. NeuroPace gaben in ihrer Pressemitteilung an, dass es in ihren Langzeittests nach 2 Jahren schon 55% der Patienten waren. Nicht schlecht.</p>
<p>Trotz hohem Wow-Faktor ( <em>“Medizinische Zulassung für <strong>Hirnimplantate</strong>!!1”</em>) sollte aber klar sein, dass dieser Neurostimulator nicht das eigentliche Problem behebt—er unterdrückt “nur” die Symptome. Für manch einen Betroffenen dürfte das allerdings schon eine Verbesserung der Lebensqualität darstellen.</p>
<p>Was mich daran fasziniert: dies ist schon die zweite Story über Neurostimulatoren, über die ich in den letzten 6 Monaten gestolpert bin. (Die erste war der 39-jährige Andrew Johnson in Neuseeland, der einen Stimulator implantiert bekam, um seiner Parkinson-Krankheit etwas entgegenzusetzen. Das kurze Video im Artikel (siehe Links zum Thema) ist beeindruckend und beklemmend zugleich.) Wir sind Dir auf der Schliche, Hirn! :)</p>
<p>Weltweit leiden ca. 65 mio Menschen an Epilepsie.</p>

<h2 id="implantierbare-schlankmacher">Implantierbare Schlankmacher</h2>
<p>Biotechniker der Eidgenössischen Technischen Hochschule Zürich (Schweiz) haben einen implantierbaren, genetischen Regulator entwickelt, der Blutfett-Werte in Mäusen überwacht. Wenn diese einen gesunden Schwellenwert überschreiten, sendet der Regelkreis Botenstoffe aus, die dem Körper Sättigung signalisieren. Wenn die Werte sich normalisieren, wird die Produktion der Botenstoffe wieder eingestellt.</p>
<p>Das Ergebnis im Labor: Fettleibige Mäuse mümmelten weniger vom reichlich vorhandenen Futter, und nahmen nach und nach ab. Als sie ihr “Idealgewicht” erreichten (und durchschnittliche Blutfett-Werte), aßen sie wieder normal.</p>
<p>Auch, wenn die Resultate nicht direkt auf Menschen übertragbar sind, so ist das doch ein ermutigender Schritt zum Ziel hin, das wachsende Gewichtsproblem weltweit in den Griff zu bekommen. Laut WHO sind mehr als die Hälfte der Menschen in Industrieländern übergewichtig, jeder Dritte davon stark. Je höher das Übergewicht, desto höher das Risiko auf Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen und Diabetes Typ 2, beides häufige Todesursachen in westlichen Industrienationen.</p>

<h2 id="hautzellen-in-lungenzellen-transformiert">Hautzellen in Lungenzellen transformiert</h2>
<p>US-Wissenschaftler am Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) haben es erstmals geschafft, Hautzellen in Lungenzellen umzuwandeln. Ihr neuentwickeltes Verfahren hat großes Potential: es ermöglicht die bessere Erforschung von Lungenkrankheiten, erweiterte Arzneimitteltests und (längerfristig) auch, Lungengewebe für Transplantationen züchten zu können.</p>
<p>In den letzten Jahren hat die Wissenschaft viel erreicht: aus Hautzellen gewonnene Stammzellen können u.A. in Herz-, Leber- und Nervenzellen umgewandelt werden, bis jetzt jedoch noch nicht in Lungenzellen. Zwar liegt eine klinische Anwendung dieser neuen Technik noch mehrere Jahre in der Zukunft, die Meldung stimmt mich aber doch positiv: derzeit sind Patienten, die eine Lungentransplantation erhielten, nämlich im Durchschnitt alle fünf Jahre auf einen neuen Lungenspender angewiesen. Ihnen könnte aller Voraussicht nach dauerhaft geholfen werden, könnte man neue Lungen aus ihren eigenen Zellen züchten. Bald…!</p>

<h2 id="gesellschaft-alkoholkonsum-rückläufig">Gesellschaft: Alkoholkonsum rückläufig!</h2>
<p>Nichts beweist doch eindeutiger, wie schlecht es um unsere Gesellschaft steht, als die ständige Zunahme des Alkoholkonsums, oder? Immer dieser Leistungsdruck und immer dieser Stress, das kann man ja auch nur aushalten, indem man sich ab und zu ‘mal die Kante gibt! Und dann diese Alkoholikertreffen, wie z.B. das Oktoberfest in München—peinlich, was da getrunken wird! <em>[Ey! —Anm. Carlo]</em></p>
<p>Doof an diesem Standpunkt ist nur, das er völlig falsch ist. Die World Health Organization (WHO) teilt uns dieses Jahr mit, das in Deutschland der Alkoholkonsum seit 40 Jahren ständig rückläufig ist: von 15 Litern 100%igem<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> pro Person Mitte der Siebziger—umgerechnet ca. 600 halbe Bier!–auf unter zehn Liter im letzten Jahr. Und seit vier Jahren nimmt überraschenderweise auch kontinuierlich der Alkoholkonsum bei Jugendlichen ab, bei (gefühlt) zunehmender Frequenz des Themas “Komasaufen” in Boulevard und Politik.</p>

<p><a href="http://science.orf.at/stories/1727077/"><strong>Kleinkind dauerhaft von HIV geheilt</strong></a> — Der Behandlungserfolg bei einem mit HIV zur Welt gekommenen Mädchen lässt hoffen, dass eine frühe Therapie die Vermehrung der Viren bei Neugeborenen verhindern kann. Die Kleine bekam insg. 18 Monate lang antiretrovirale Medikamente, danach traten keine Symptome der Krankheit mehr bei ihr auf. Wegen dieses Überraschungserfolgs startet 2014 in den USA eine durch Bundesmittel geförderte Studie, in deren Zentrum eine solche Therapie für Neugeborene mit HIV-Infektion steht.</p>

Über einen Katheter (minimal-invasiv!) wurde das Herz mit reiner menschlicher DNA (dem Botenstoff SDF-1) durchspült, die dem Körper signalisiert, dass das Organ repariert werden muss, was die im Körper vorhandenen Stammzellen dann auch tun. Der Mann war während der Operation bei Bewusstsein, konnte kurz danach das Krankenhaus verlassen, und fühlt sich nach eigenem Bekunden <em>“so gut wie seit Jahren nicht mehr”</em>. <strong>HOT DAMN.</strong></p>

			 <p>Donnerstagmorgen sind dafür da, um sich auf <a href="http://www.spacex.com/webcast/">den Start von SpaceX’ neuer <em>Falcon 9</em>-Rakete</a> kurz vor Mitternacht zu freuen. Der Countdown am Dienstag wurde abgebrochen, aber heute nacht um 23:38 Uhr geht bestimmt alles glatt.</p>
<p><strong>Ausgabe #10!</strong> Erinnern wir uns zurück: damals, als ich <em>Neues aus der Zukunft</em> begonnen habe, war die Welt noch eine andere. Das Leben war einfacher, die Zeiten weniger hektisch, das Wetter weniger kalt. Aber es gab weniger Glühwein damals, und weniger Bratwürste! Das allein kann man als Anhaltspunkt dafür werten, dass sich das Dasein der Deutschen verbessert hat. Und das innerhalb von nur 10 Wochen!</p>
<p>Gern geschehen.</p>
<p>Diese Woche sieht eine erfreuliche Entwicklung: ich darf unseren ersten Gastoptimisten begrüßen! Mein treuer <em>NadZ</em>-Leser <a href="mailto:wunderlich@witzmacher.com">Oliver Wunderlich</a> hat sich angeboten, mir ein wenig unter die Arme zu greifen, und wird zu den nächsten Ausgaben einige aufmunternde gesellschaftliche Meldungen beisteuern.

<h2 id="strom-aus-ungenutzter-energie">Strom aus ungenutzter Energie</h2>
<p>Studenten an der Duke University in North Carolina, USA, haben eine Technologie entwickelt, mit der Energie aus Mikrowellensignalen zurückgewonnen werden kann. Sie setzen dabei auf Metamaterialien (künstlich hergestellten Strukturen mit interessanten physikalischen Fähigkeiten, die so in der Natur nicht vorkommen). Je nachdem, wie das Gerät eingestellt ist, wandelt es z.B. WLAN- oder Satelliten-Signale, Vibrationen oder auch Schallwellen in verwertbare Energie um. Wie eine Antenne, die “aus der Luft” Strom empfängt!</p>
<p>Die Möglichkeiten, die dieses Konzept eröffnet, sind faszinierend. Die Studenten stellen sich z.B. einen Metamaterialen-Anstrich für Zimmerwände vor, der Wifi-Signale “einfängt”, die sonst ungenutzt verloren gehen würden, um sie in Strom zu verwandeln. Mit einigen Modifikationen wäre auch ein Einsatz in Mobiltelefonen denkbar, um mit Hilfe der normalen Funkmastenstrahlung den Akku zu laden. Ich persönlich denke da auch an Geräte, die die Vibration im Auto nutzen, um dann Teile der Bordelektronik zu versorgen. Oder auch an Kopfhörer mit aktiver Lärmreduzierung, die keine AAA-Batterien mehr benötigen, sondern direkt von den Umgebungsgeräuschen “angetrieben” werden.</p>
<p>Wenn man es sich genau überlegt, ist das auch eine Art von grüner Energie: es wird Abfall verwendet, also normalerweise verschwendete Energie (mechanische, akustische, elektromagnetische…), um vor Ort Strom zu erzeugen. Super!</p>
<p>Ganz ehrlich, wäre ich ein großer zentraler Energieerzeuger, ich würde langsam panisch werden. Aber das bin ich nicht, und so finde ich diese Entwicklung ganz famos. :)</p>

<h2 id="der-menschen-fortschritt-in-diagrammen">Der Menschen Fortschritt, in Diagrammen</h2>
<p><em>“Die Menschheit ist doch nicht so verloren, wie wir dachten”</em>. Das sagt das VICE Magazin, und um diese Aussage zu unterstreichen, haben sie einige Diagramme und Fakten auf der neuen HumanProgress-Website zusammengesucht. Anhand von sieben Beispielen—globale Armut, das Lohngefälle zwischen Männern und Frauen, Bildung weltweit etc.—demonstrieren sie, wie man HumanProgress’ clever aufbereitete Statistiken, Zahlen und Diagramme nutzen kann, um manch eine Biertisch-Diskussion mit ein paar positiven Fakten abzukürzen. Amerikanische Forscher haben nämlich herausgefunden, dass früher mitnichten alles besser war!</p>
<p>Auf der HP-Site kann man sich etwas verlieren (wenn man des Englischen mächtig ist). Aber das meine ich nicht negativ! Erstens, weil ich als Geek Zahlen und Fakten dem wagen Bauchgefühl vorziehe, und zweitens, weil viele der präsentierten Informationen ein mutmachendes Bild zeichnen. Die Menschheit ist nicht perfekt, und der Weg vor uns ist weiterhin holprig, aber wir sind—salopp formuliert—auch nicht komplett am Arsch. Hurra! ;)</p>

<h2 id="gesellschaft-verkehrsunfalltrends">Gesellschaft: Verkehrsunfalltrends</h2>
<p>Uns allen geht’s doch so: Autofahren macht immer weniger Spass.</p>
<p>Hauptgrund ist möglicherweise, das es jedes Jahr teurer wird, sich ein Auto zu leisten. Aber auch die Verkehrsdichte nimmt immer weiter zu, ein Abwärtstrend lässt sich nirgendwo ausmachen. So waren z.B. 1970 in der BRD laut Statistischem Bundesamt 20,8 Mio Fahrzeuge zugelassen; in der DDR waren es weniger als 6 Mio, rund die Hälfte davon waren PKW—insgesamt also ~26,5 Mio. Gut vierzig Jahre später, im Jahr 2012, waren es 60,8 Millionen Fahrzeuge… also pro Bundesbürger ca. ein Dreiviertelautomobil!</p>
<p>Erfreulich ist aber etwas ganz Anderes: bis 1970 nahm mit den Zulassungen auch die Anzahl der Verkehrstoten jährlich zu, diese traurige Statistik erreichte ihren Höhepunkt bei über 19.000 Toten in einem Jahr. 2012 aber waren es “nur” noch 3600 Opfer. <strong>Und dank moderner Fahrzeugtechnik und besserer Straßenführung ist das ist ein anhaltender Abwärtstrend!</strong> (Wobei die Technik allerdings nicht helfen kann, ist Blödheit: 2012 waren 20% der betroffenen Fahrer nicht angegurtet, 10% von ihnen standen unter Alkoholeinfluss.)</p>
<p>Wenn sich jetzt noch jemand um die dauernden Staus allüberall kümmern könnte, wäre das natürlich noch schöner. Aber andererseits brauchen wir ja bald nicht mehr selbst lenken, wir werden dann von unseren selbstfahrenden Automobilen chauffiert, während wir unsere Sammlung von Bob-Ross-GIFs vervollständigen.</p>

Vor zwei Wochen verkündete IBM, dass sie Watson für Entwickler und Firmen öffnen, damit diese Watsons virtuelle Intelligenz für ihre eigenen Projekte nutzen können. Vor zehn Jahren noch waren die Kosten für solche Systeme exorbitant, und heute kann man sie einfach bei Bedarf für wenig Geld mieten. Du brauchst kurzfristig für 1 Stunde die Rechenpower von 10.000 PC? Das geht z.B. bei Amazon ohne Voranmeldung und kostet Dich dann ~€70. Kein Witz. Es ist toll.</p>

<h2 id="cansar-vs-cancer">CanSAR vs. Cancer</h2>
<p>Krebs gehts an den Kragen, dank des großen aktuellen Projekts des <em>Institute of Cancer Research and Cancer Research UK</em>. Es heisst <strong>canSAR</strong>—was ausgesprochen so klingt wie “cancer”, dem englischen Wort für “Krebs”—und ist eine kostenlose, öffentliche, auf Krebs fokussierte Wissensdatenbank. Sie <em>“bringt biologische, chemische, pharmakologische und krankheitsbezogene Daten zusammen, verbindet sie, und macht sie Wissenschaftlern aller Disziplinen der Krebsforschung zugänglich”</em> (Zitat Website).</p>
<p>CanSAR enthält Milliarden von experimentellen Ergebnissen und Datenpunkten aus der ganzen Welt; es nutzt hochentwickeltes maschinelles Lernen und künstliche Intelligenz, um versteckte Pfade zwischen den Daten zu finden, mögliche Therapierisiken frühzeitig zu erkennen und Vorschläge zur Behandlung zu machen, die im Labor getestet werden können. <strong>Es macht aus Unmengen roher Daten hilfreiche Informationen.</strong></p>
<p>Und es gibt Wissenschaftlern die Möglichkeit, diese Informationen einfach wie nie zu durchsuchen—gewonnen aus den Daten unzähliger Patienten und vielen Labors <em>weltweit</em>. Sie haben dabei Zugriff auf mehr gut aufbereitete Informationen als jemals zuvor, sie können eventuelle Übereinstimmungen mit ihren eigenen Fällen finden, und damit von dem in CanSAR angesammelten Wissen profitieren.</p>
<p>Die CanSAR-Datenbank ist kostenlos für Forscher und Mediziner auf der ganzen Welt verfügbar. Sie mag nicht flashy sein, sie mag nicht in den Nachrichten auftauchen, aber sie wird einer Menge Menschen helfen. Stille Helden etc.—ich finds toll.</p>

<h2 id="schau-mir-in-die-kameras-kleines">Schau mir in die Kameras, Kleines</h2>
<p>Die Firma Second Sight Medical Products, Inc. hat eine Netzhautprothese entwickelt, die Menschen zugute kommt, die an der Erbkrankheit <em>Retinitis Pigmentosa</em> leiden, die in den meisten Fällen zu Blindheit führt. Das <em>Argus® II Netzhautprothesen System</em> besteht aus einer externen Kamera (ähnlich Google Glass) mit einem Bildverarbeitungsmodul, das Daten drahtlos an einen winzigen Elektrodenträger sendet, der in die Retina des Patienten implantiert wird. Der Träger stimuliert den Sehnerv, der dann eine Art Bild an das Hirn des Patienten sendet.</p>
<p>Das System ist nicht “plug and play”, es ist eine Lernphase nötig, denn die Seheindrücke, die das Argus II produziert, sind anders als die natürlichen. Und die Sicht kann (noch) nicht vollständig hergestellt werden—die “Auflösung”, die die 60 Elektroden produzieren, ist zu gering (ein Pixel pro Elektrode). Es reicht, um mit Training Gebäude oder die Umrisse von Türen, Menschen oder Tieren zu erkennen. Das Bildverarbeitungssystem wird allerdings von Second Sight ständig weiterentwickelt, d.h. die Qualität der Informationen, die an den Sehnerv übermittelt werden, kann zu einem bestimmten Grad verbessert werden. Und auch an den Implantaten selbst wird gearbeitet: während das Vorgängermodell Argus I nur 16 Pixel hatte, bringt es der Nachfolger Argus III (in Entwicklung) schon auf 240 Elektroden/Pixeln.</p>
<p>Argus II erhielt vor Kurzem die klinische Zulassung in den USA—nur 2 Jahre später als in Europa. Die ersten Patienten in Deutschland bekamen das System im letzten Jahr implantiert.</p>
<p>Die Hoffnung von Second Sight und allen anderen Spielern in diesem Feld ist es, den ca. 25 mio Menschen weltweit, die ihre Sehfähigkeiten aufgrund von Erkrankungen wie makularer Degeneration oder Retinitis Pigmentosa verloren haben, helfen zu können.</p>

			 <p>Donnerstagmorgen sind dafür da, um darüber irritiert zu sein, dass Astronomie (Wissenschaft) in Deutschland immer noch weniger Freunde hat als Astrologie (grober Unfug).</p>
<p>Ironischerweise gibts heute rein gar nix zur Astronomie/Raumfahrt; das primäre Thema diesmal ist die Gentechnik, wo gerade etwas die Post abgeht. Und dann gibts noch etwas Alltägliches, was mich trotz seiner Alltäglichkeit immer wieder ziemlich flasht. Und ausserdem habe ich diese Woche zwei inspirierende Meldungen zur elektrischen Mobilität gefunden.</p>
<p>Ich hoffe, ich kann Dich auch diese Woche etwas aufmuntern, dafür mache ich das hier ja schließlich. :) Bei (Nicht-)Gefallen <a href="mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de">schreib mir eine Mail</a>! Ich mag Feedback.</p>
<p>Bis nächste Woche,</p>
<p>—Carlo.</p>
<p>PS: Es besteht die <em>Möglichkeit</em>, dass die #9 erst Ende des Monats erscheint—u.U. habe ich nächste Woche nicht genug Zeit, um eine Ausgabe zu schreiben. Ich gebe mein Bestes, aber wundere Dich bitte nicht, sollte am nächsten Donnerstag kein NadZ in Deiner Mailbox liegen.</p>

<h2 id="durchbruch-in-der-gentechnik">Durchbruch in der Gentechnik</h2>
<p>Bei der sog. Gentherapie handelt es sich um ein Feld in der Gentechnik, bei dem in die Körperzellen eines Patienten Nukleinsäuren (DNA &amp; RNA) eingefügt werden, um Gendefekte oder Krankheiten zu behandeln. Wenn z.B. ein defektes Gen eine Störung oder Krankheit hervorruft, kann es durch eine intakte Version ersetzt werden, um damit die Ursache des Problems zu beheben.</p>
<p>Soweit zumindest die Theorie. Die gängigste Methode des Einsetzens ist es, modifizierte Viren zu benutzen, die die veränderten Gene in das Erbgut der Zellen einschleusen. Das schaffen die Viren schon—aber wie und wo genau, das entzieht sich unserer Kontrolle, können sie doch nicht 100%ig gesteuert werden. Wird aber das veränderte Gen an der falschen Stelle eingesetzt, so kann es u.U. großen Schaden anrichten. Der Prozess ist also nicht zielgerichtet genug, um ihn überwiegend als “sicher” bezeichnen zu können.</p>
<p>Auftritt CRISPR-CAS9! Was nach einer Mischung zwischen einem Kellogs-Produkt und einem Spezialkommando der Polizei klingt, ist eine Sensation. CRISPR ( <em>“clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats”</em>) sind in Bakterien vorkommende Abschnitte sich wiederholender DNA; bis vor ein paar Jahren dachte die Wissenschaft noch, dass es sich dabei um sog. “ <em>junk</em>” (engl., “Müll”), also überflüssige DNA, handelt. Im Jahr 2007 stellte man dann fest, dass diese Teile der DNA tatsächlich zu einem cleveren Abwehrmechanismus gehören, mit dem die Bakterien Viren bekämpfen und Immunitäten aufbauen. Wenn die Bakterien mit Hilfe der Information in diesen Abschnitten einen Angreifer erkennen, setzen ihn ausser Gefecht, indem sie dessen DNA-Moleküle mit Hilfe von Enzymen kleinschneiden.</p>
<p>Zwei Wissenschafterinnen, Prof. Jennifer Doudna (UC Berkeley, USA) und Prof. Emmanuelle Charpentier (Umea University, Sweden), haben darauf basierend zusammen in den letzten Jahren eine Technik entwickelt, die es erlaubt, DNA punktgenau bearbeiten zu können. Sie bedienen sich dabei eines Enzyms namens CAS9, das sie “programmiert” haben, einen DNA-Strang an exakt vorgegebenen Stellen zu zertrennen. In diese Stellen können dann neue Informationen/Gene eingesetzt werden.</p>
<p><strong>Ihre Arbeit stellt einen Durchbruch in der Gentechnik dar: sie haben eine Methode gefunden, die DNA in einem komplexen Genom akkurat zu bearbeiten.</strong></p>
<p>Ihre Technik wurde bereits von mehreren Teams weltweit erfolgreich an den unterschiedlichsten Organismen getestet, von Pflanzen über Fruchtfliegen und Fischen bis hin zu Mäusen, und das Echo war laut und positiv. Der Biochemiker Craig Mello, Nobelpreisträger für Physiologie/Medizin 2006, sagte: <em>“Als ich [die angewandte Technik] in meinem Labor sah, klappte mir die Kinnlade herunter. Ein totaler Anfänger in meinem Labor hat sie erfolgreich eingesetzt.”</em></p>
<p>Die Möglichkeiten sind in der Tat überwältigend; Prof. Doudnas Team z.B. arbeitet derzeit an möglichen Gentherapien für die Huntington-Erbkrankheiten, die tödlich und bisher nicht heilbar ist. Andere Forscher sprechen bereits über die Veränderung des Gens, das die Erkrankung des Körpers mit HIV zulässt.</p>
<p>Sicher wirft das neue ethische Fragen auf, und auch einige ältere Diskussionen werden sicher erneut aufgenommen werden. Ja, diese Diskussionen sind wichtig und müssen geführt werden, aber wie auch immer sie ausgehen mögen: der Schritt von der Kürbiskanone zum Scharfschützengewehr ist getan, die Gentechnik entwickelt sich (anders als meine Metaphern) vielversprechend weiter.</p>

<h2 id="nachbrenner-für-die-wundheilung">Nachbrenner für die Wundheilung</h2>
<p>Die Körper von jungen Tieren können beschädigtes Gewebe schneller reparieren als die von älteren—das kennt man ja zuhause, wenn der kleine Kevin sich mal wieder das Knie beim Fussballspielen aufschlägt, ist zwei Tage danach alles wieder gut, aber mit Ende 30 zehrt man von solch einer Verletzung <em>wo-chen-lang</em>. Aber warum ist das so?</p>
<p>In embryonalen Stammzellen existiert ein aktives Gen namens Lin28a, dass dafür sorgt, dass beim Kind Haare, Knochen, Knorpel, Haut und andere Weichteile (nach)wachsen. Nach der Geburt stellt es aber nach und nach seine Arbeit ein, und mit Erreichen des Erwachsenenalters ist das Gen dann deaktiviert. Der Frage, was passiert, wenn man dieses “stillgelegte” Gen in älteren Mäusen reaktiviert, sind Forscher vom Boston Children’s Hospital (USA) nachgegangen.</p>
<p>Das Gen also nahm seine Arbeit wieder auf, und die Selbstheilungskräfte der älteren Tierchen wurden wieder so stark wie bei Jungtieren. Die Mäusekörper reparierten Wunden und Verletzungen ähnlich schnell wie Mäuse im embryonalen Stadium; allerdings reguliert Lin28a nicht die Zellheilung in allen Bereichen des Körpers—während Knorpel, Haut und Haare nachwuchsen, zeigte sich z.B. bei Verletzungen am Herzen keine Besserung.</p>
<p>Die Bostoner Wissenschaftler stellten fest, dass Lin28a u.A. funktioniert, weil es ein “Tuning” des Metabolismus der Mitochondrien vornimmt (den “Energieerzeugern” der Zellen)—ein Effekt, der auch durch mit etwas pharmakologischer Hilfe von aussen angeschoben werden kann. Das weist ihrer Meinung darauf hin, dass relativ simples “Reinemachen” auf Zellebene ein neuer Ansatz der regenerativen Medizin sein könnte.</p>
<p>Lin28a existiert in allen komplexen Organismen.</p>

<h2 id="adhoc-übersetzung-per-smartphone">Adhoc-Übersetzung per Smartphone</h2>
<p>Schon etwas älter, aber immer noch relativ unbekannt: visuelle Übersetzer-Apps für iPhone &amp; Co. Stell Dir vor, Du bist im fremdsprachigen Ausland unterwegs und stolperst über Schilder, die Du nicht lesen kannst. Du könntest Dein Wörterbuch zücken und nachschlagen, oder aber die <em>Word Lens</em>-App der Firma Quest Visual auf Deinem Smartphone starten, die Kamera auf das Schild richten, und die Übersetzung im Display ablesen—der Text im echten Schild wird dabei mit die Übersetzung ersetzt. Klingt irre, ist es auch. (Schau Dir das kurze Video auf der Website von Quest Visual an!)</p>
<p>Ich mag die App, weil die Idee dahinter klasse ist: sie löst ein Problem, das jeder kennen dürfte, der hin und wieder verreist. Es nutzt die Technologie, die wir ohnehin mit uns rumtragen, um Reisenden das Leben zu vereinfachen. Sicher, die App ist nicht perfekt, und die Auswahl an Sprachen ist (für deutschsprachige Nutzer) dürftig, aber das tut der Sache keinen Abbruch. Ganz ehrlich, wir sind an dem Punkt angekommen, wo ich es fast als Downgrade empfinden würde, wenn mir jemand einen funktionieren <em>Star Trek</em>-Tricorder im Austausch mit meinem iPhone anbieten würde. ;) Dieses kleine, flache, schwarze Ding aus Glas und Metall, das ich immer in meiner Hosentasche bei mir habe, es hat sehr wahrscheinlich mehr Rechenpower als alles, was die NASA vor 30-40 Jahren aufbieten konnte.</p>
<p>Das wird mir hin und wieder klar, und dann muss ich lachen.</p>
<p>PS: Wer einfach nur ein Tool für Spracherkennung-Übersetzung-Sprachausgabe sucht, dem sei die <em>Google Translate</em>-App ans Herz gelegt. Auf deutsch reinsprechen, das Smartphone liest die Übersetzung vor.</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/CdE9o51_P_4"><strong>Tesla Motors investiert stark in Deutschland</strong></a> (Video, 10:24 min, englisch) — Tesla-Chef Elon Musk war vor drei Wochen in München, um ein Servicecenter für <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/de_DE/">Tesla’s elektrische Fahrzeuge</a> einzuweihen. Dort verriet er den Fahrplan für Deutschland: bis Ende 2014 wird jeder Deutsche (ohne umziehen zu müssen!) in Reichweite einer ihrer <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/de_DE/supercharger">Supercharger-Station</a> wohnen, die einen Tesla innerhalb von 30-40 min wieder aufladen können. Ich hatte ja gehofft, dass wir bald <strong>eine umfassende Abdeckung an elektrischen Auto-Ladestationen</strong> sehen werden—nur hätte ich nicht geglaubt, dass es eine amerikanische Firma sein würde, die dieses Projekt hier im Land des Automobilbaus angeht. LOL@you, Volkswagen, BMW &amp; Mercedes. Aber in aller Fairness muss man auch zugeben, dass nur Tesla es ernst meint mit den elektrischen Fahrzeugen.</p>
<p><a href="http://singularityhub.com/2013/11/13/fetal-dna-sequencing-experiencing-revolution-with-new-non-invasive-testing-goodbye-amnio/"><strong>Pränatale Diagnose ohne Fruchtwasseruntersuchung</strong></a> (englisch) — Das US-Unternehmen Illumina, Inc. hat <a href="http://investor.illumina.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=121127&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1871236&amp;highlight=">eine Methode zur Frühdiagnostik</a> von Ungeborenen entwickelt, mit dem genetische Defekte festgestellt werden können, ohne dass die Mütter sich einer Fruchtwasseruntersuchung unterziehen müssen. Dabei wird aus einer Blutprobe der Mutter die fötale DNA des Kindes extrahiert, die dann untersucht werden kann. Der non-invasive Test hat eine sehr hohe Genauigkeit und verringert das Risiko für Mutter und Kind gegenüber herkömmlichen Untersuchungen. Kalifornien hat der Methode schon die staatliche Zulassung erteilt.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/07/driverless-cars-coming-to-milton-keynes"><strong>Autonome Fahrzeuge im öffentlichen Nahverkehr</strong></a> (englisch) — Die britische Stadt Milton Keynes wird ab 2015 selbstfahrende elektrische Automobile im ÖPNV einsetzen.

Randnotiz: Die meisten der großen Autohersteller arbeiten mittlerweile an selbstfahrenden Autos, über das Thema werden wir in den nächsten Jahren noch mehr hören.</p>

<h2 id="herzschrittmacherminiaturisierungsfortschritte">Herzschrittmacherminiaturisierungsfortschritte</h2>
<p>(Solche Worte gibts nur in der deutschen Sprache. Hah!) Herzschrittmacher helfen Patienten, deren Herz zu langsam schlägt. Die Geräte dienen als Taktgeber, die geschundenen Pumpen einen normalen Rythmus vorgeben. Sie kommen mittlerweile seit 55 Jahren zum Einsatz, jährlich werden weltweit ca. 700.000 Menschen mit neuen Schrittmachern versorgt.</p>
<p>Der erste komplett im menschlichen Körper eingebettete Herzschrittmacher wurde 1958 in Solna, Schweden, eingepflanzt. Er war relativ klobig und schwer, aber er funktionierte… für 3 Stunden. Er wurde ausgetauscht; das neue Gerät lief 2 Tage. Der Patient, Arne Larsson, bekam insgesamt 26 verschiedene Schrittmacher vor seinem Tod. Das war 2001, er starb mit 86 Jahren.</p>
<p>Seit dieser ersten erfolgreichen Operation wurden die Lebensretter ständig verfeinert: die Akkus, die anfangs noch alle paar <em>Stunden</em> aufgeladen werden mussten, wurden sehr viel ausdauernder, die Geräte selbst wurden verkleinert, standardisiert und verbessert. Neuere Geräte sind drahtlos ausles- und steuerbar, um dem Mediziner eine bessere Kontrolle über das Gerät zu geben. In den letzten 55 Jahren ist viel passiert! (Lustige Randnotiz: Darth Cheney, ehem. US-Vizepräsident, hat diese Drahtlos-Funktionalität in seinem Herzschrittmacher deaktivieren lassen, aus Angst vor einem technischen Anschlag auf sein Leben.)</p>
<p>Hatte das Gerät von 1958 noch ein Hohlmaß von 35cm³ (also ungefähr wie ein Eishockey-Puck) und ein Gewicht von 73g, so waren 50 Jahre später die die kleinsten Geräte bei ca. 15g und 6cm³ angekommen. Und heute? Letzten Monat erhielt das sog. <em>Nanostim</em>-Gerät die medizinische Zulassung in der EU. Es wurde in Kalifornien entwickelt und ist winzig: <strong>1cm³ bei einem Gewicht von nur 2g</strong>. Und die Batterie des Winzlings (⌀6mm × 41.4mm) soll ungefähr 10 Jahre halten! Implantiert wird es über einen Katheter, der es von der Lendengegend zum Herzen transportiert, wo es dann in einer der Herzkammern “liegt”—eine größere OP wird damit unnötig und die Belastung für den Patienten stark verringert.</p>
<p>Beeindruckend.</p>

<h2 id="open-access-wird-10-jahre-alt">Open Access wird 10 Jahre alt</h2>
<p>Sagen wir mal, Du willst die Ergebnisse Deiner wissenschaftlichen Studie veröffentlichen. Diese Studie wurde aus öffentlichen Hand finanziert, also vom Steuerzahler. Meistens erfolgt diese Veröffentlichung in Fachliteratur, dafür musst Du dem Verlag die Nutzungsrechte an Deiner Studie übertragen. Der Verlag bringt Deine Studie dann als Teil seiner teuren Publikationen heraus; diese muss von Unis, Labors und Bibliotheken bei Interesse gekauft werden—aber nicht selten kommt das Geld dafür ebenso aus der öffentlichen Hand. Die Öffentlichkeit wird also zweimal zur Kasse gebeten: einmal für Forschungsgelder, einmal von Verlagen in privater Hand, die das aus den Projekten gewonnene Wissen an die Öffentlichkeit <em>verkaufen</em>.</p>
<p>Vor 10 Jahren riefen einige Wissenschaftler, denen diese Praxis bitter aufstiess, die internationale Open-Access-Bewegung ins Leben. ( <em>“Open access”</em>: freier Zugang.) Sie wollten öffentliche Forschung tatsächlich wieder öffentlich machen; <em>“wissenschaftliche Publikationen als Ergebnisse der von der Öffentlichkeit geförderten Forschung [sollen] dieser Öffentlichkeit wiederum kostenfrei zur Verfügung gestellt werden”</em>, denn die <em>“bisherigen Publikationsstrukturen stellen eine Privatisierung des von der Allgemeinheit finanzierten Wissens dar”</em> (Zitat Wikipedia). Nur Forschung, deren Ergebnisse auch verfügbar ist, hilft der Wissenschaft als Ganzes weiter. Dieser etwas in Vergessenheit geratene Grundgedanke gewinnt wieder verstärkt Freunde, und so gewinnt Open Access stetig an Boden, trotz Gegenwind der am alten System gut verdienenden Verlage.</p>
<p>Die OA-Mission, die ehrenvolle und essentielle Tradition des Peer-Review mit der globalen Transparenz des Netzes zu verbinden: sie kommt voran, aber der Weg ist nicht ohne Steine, und so ist Open Access noch lange nicht die Norm. Dank vielversprechendem Support und einer robusten internationalen Infrastruktur sind mittlerweile knapp ein Fünftel aller jährlich neu erscheinenden, wissenschaftlichen Veröffentlichungen frei zugänglich—Tendenz steigend. Dieser Erfolg der Bewegung ist beachtlich, existiert die Bewegung doch erst 10 Jahre.</p>
<p><strong>Wissenschaft behauptet sich gegen den Kommerz</strong>—das ist doch mal eine schöne Meldung. Alles Gute für die nächste Dekade, liebe Open-Access-Bewegung!</p>

<h2 id="nanosensoren">Nanosensoren</h2>
<p>Chemiker am MIT haben mit Hilfe von Kohlenstoffnanoröhren ( <em>carbon nanotubes</em>) einen subdermalen Langzeit-Nanosensor entwickelt, der die Konzentration von Stickstoffmonoxid (chem. NO) im Körper misst, einem der wichtigsten Signalmoleküle in lebenden Zellen. NO wird vom Körper u.A. bei der Koordination des Immunsystems genutzt, und produziert, wenn Entzündungen entstehen. Der Sensor registrierte diese in Tierversuchen; einmal eingesetzt funktionierte er für ca. 400 Tage.</p>
<p>Kohlenstoffnanoröhren sind in den Augen vieler Wissenschaftler von großem Interesse beim Einsatz in Sensoren. Die hohlen, nur einen Nanometer dünnen Zylinder aus reinem Kohlenstoff wurden im MIT-Labor benutzt, um durch das Vorhandensein unterschiedlicher Moleküle unterschiedliche Stoffe nachzuweisen, wie z.B. Oxidationsmittel wie Wasserstoffperoxid, toxische Substanzen wie Saringas, oder eben auch Stickstoffmonoxid. Die Röhrchen besitzen eine natürliche Fluoreszenz; wenn sie mit einem Molekül gekoppelt werden, das ein bestimmtes anderes Molekül “aufspüren” kann, verändert sich die Fluoreszenz. Wenn der unter der Haut befindliche Sensor dann mit einem Nah-Infrarot-Laser angepeilt wird, kann der Grad der Fluoreszenz ausgelesen werden—der Sensor gibt damit seine Messdaten preis.</p>
<p>Diese Meldung gefällt mir, weil sie ein gutes Bild davon zeichnet, wie die neue Generation von Sensoren aussieht bzw. aussehen wird: ohne Kabel, Batterien und Elektroden, die in den Körper gesteckt werden, dafür mit Nanotechnologie und Licht. Im Moment z.B. arbeitet das Team vom MIT daran, ihre Technologie für Glukose-Nanosensoren zu adaptieren—Diabetiker dürfen bei Gelingen auf eine Zukunft ohne Blutglukose-Messung durch Stich in die Fingerkuppe hoffen.</p>
<p>Allerdings vermute ich, dass es noch ein paar Wochen dauern wird, bis Nanosensoren bei unseren Hausärzten ankommen werden. Egal! Ich harre aus.</p>

			 <p>Donnerstagmorgen sind dafür da, um über <del>die großartigen Möglichkeiten des 21. Jahrhunderts</del> das lange Wochende nachzudenken und alle 2 min auf die Uhr zu schauen. Ist es schon Mittagszeit?</p>
<p>Erinnerst Du Dich, wie ich in der letzten Ausgabe sagte, ich müsse das Tempo etwas bremsen? Das meinte ich auch so! Und dann setzte ich mich hin und schrieb begeistert 1100+ Worte zu NewSpace.

<h2 id="was-ich-meine-wenn-ich-von-newspace-spreche">Was ich meine, wenn ich von &ldquo;NewSpace&rdquo; spreche</h2>
<p>Was ist “NewSpace”? Ich habe den Begriff schon des Öfteren an dieser Stelle verwendet, wenn ich von neuen Raumfahrt-Unternehmen spreche. Für die Erklärung muss ich aber kurz etwas ausholen.</p>
<p><strong>Der Wettlauf ins All</strong> begann, als die Sowjetunion 1957 den ersten künstlichen Satelliten— <em>Sputnik</em>—ins den Weltraum schickten; die USA hatte sich von dem Schock noch nicht komplett erholt, da legte die SU nach und sandte 1961 den Fliegeroffizier Juri Gagarin in den Erdorbit. Selbstverständlich konnten sich die Vereinigten Staaten nicht so einfach die historisch bedeutsame Butter vom Brot der Menschheitsgeschichte nehmen lassen, und so bezwangen sie heroisch das nervöse Zucken in ihren Augen und beendeten 1969 mit der <em>Apollo 11</em>-Mission das Rennen zum Mond (und damit den Wettlauf).</p>
<p>Das war vor gut vier Jahrzehnten; damals gingen viele Menschen davon aus, dass das goldene Zeitalter in der Raumfahrt eingeläutet sei—nächster Halt: Mars! Doch weit gefehlt. Zwar sahen die nächsten drei Jahrzehnte die russische Raumstation <em>Mir</em>, das amerikanische <em>Space Shuttle</em>-Programm und die ISS; aber abgesehen von einer überschaubaren Anzahl von Sonden, die in unserem Auftrag im Sonnensystem unterwegs sind, sind wir doch auf der Erde und im erdnahen Orbit geblieben. Denn die einzigen Spieler auf dem Feld der Raumfahrt, die sich derlei Projekte leisten konnten, waren Regierungen/Staaten, die aus unterschiedlichen Gründen nicht mehr bereit waren, die Summen zu investieren, die uns weiter vorangebracht hätten. Dazu kam, dass die meisten wissenschaftlichen Großprojekte länger als eine Legislaturperiode dauern, und mehr als ein Regierungswechsel beendete vielversprechende und bereits laufende Projekte vorzeitig.</p>
<p><strong>Die Jahrtausendwende sah dann eine interessante Entwicklung:</strong> die Menschheit hatte sich technologisch endlich so weit entwickelt, dass kommerzielle Raumfahrt-Ansätze in greifbare Nähe rückten. Gleichzeitig wurde klar, dass die staatlichen Agenturen (NASA, Roskosmos, ESA etc.) über die Jahre hinweg lethargisch geworden waren—genau das, was früher für Beständigkeit, Mittel und Möglichkeiten gesorgt hatte, wurde plötzlich zum Bremsklotz; ausufernde Bürokratie, interne Lagerbildung, die Bindung an ihre Staaten und deren wirtschaftliche Situation halfen nicht.</p>
<p>Der freie Markt witterte Morgenluft, und es entstanden einige Firmen, deren Ziel es war (und ist), den Weltraum zu erreichen, auch ohne die Technik der NASA &amp; Co., und das kostengünstiger, effizienter, in schnelleren Entwicklungszyklen.</p>
<p>Aber auch die nichtkommerzielle Weltraumgemeinde bekam endlich die Möglichkeit, in einem vertretbaren finanziellen Rahmen dem Ort ihres Interesses näherzukommen—in Form von selbstentwickelten Raketen, unbemannten Stratosphären-Ballons mit Kameras und Sensoren, etc.—und/oder zielgerichtete Projekte mit Rat, Tat und Crowdfunding zu unterstützen.</p>
<p>All diese Initiativen (mit all ihren unterschiedlichen Zielen) und ihre zugrundeliegende Philosophie sind das, was man in dem Begriff “NewSpace” zusammenfasst. Eine <em>kurze</em> Liste von Beispielen:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Space Exploration Technologies Corp.</strong> (SpaceX) entwickelt Launch-System und Raumfähren. SpaceX arbeitet an wiederverwendbaren Raketen (siehe NadZ #2, <em>“Wirtschaftlichkeit… IN SPACE”</em>), versorgt die ISS aktiv mit Gütern, und wird bald auch Astronauten zur ISS befördern (im Rahmen eines Vertrages mit der NASA). SpaceX’ erklärtes Ziel ist es, die Besiedlung anderer Planeten zu ermöglichen. Wie drückte es Elon Musk, NewSpace-Pionier und SpaceX-Gründer, so treffend aus? <em>“Ich würde gern auf dem Mars sterben, nur halt nicht beim Aufprall.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bigelow Aerospace</strong> baut aufblasbare Habitatmodule für den Einsatz im Weltraum. Die Module werden platzsparend transportiert, und entfalten sich an ihrem Einsatzort auf ein Vielfaches ihrer Größe. Die ersten Starts fanden 2006 und 2007 statt; Mitte 2015 wird ein solches “Bigelow Expandable Activity Module” (BEAM) an der ISS angedockt und getestet. Die Firma arbeitet an einer privaten Raumstation, deren Module 2016 fertig für ihren Einsatz im Orbit sein soll, und die Bigelow an Firmen, Länder und Privatpersonen vermieten will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Final Frontier Designs</strong> hat sich auf die Entwicklung von neuen Raumanzügen spezialisiert, die Astronauten im Schiff bzw. in der Station tragen. FFD hatte 2012 ein erfolgreiches Kickstarter-Projekt am Start, um einen Prototypen fertigstellen zu können. Die Firma ist ein gutes Beispiel für die aufblühende NewSpace-Zulieferindustrie: sie wollen ihre Anzüge für $50.000/Stück verkaufen—die derzeit von der NASA entwickelten und eingesetzten Modelle kosten das Fünffache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copenhagen Suborbitals</strong> erwähnte ich in NadZ #3 schon einmal (“Zu guter Letzt… → Dänemark hat ein Raumfahrtprogramm!”). Die Dänen benutzen handelsübliche Materialien für ihre Raketen und Geräte, und starten von einem schwimmenden Ponton in internationalen Gewässern aus. Sie zeigen gut, wie sehr Technologie zur Demokratisierung der Raumfahrt beiträgt—sie ist nicht mehr zwangsläufig nur das Metier von Staaten und Großkonzernen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cubesats</strong> sind keine Firma, sondern miniaturisierte Satelliten, deren standardisierte Größe zwischen 10×10×10cm und 30×10×10cm liegt. Aufgrund ihrer Größe sind die Geräte nicht so wahnsinnig leistungsfähig, allerdings war die ursprüngliche Grundidee auch, Studenten halbwegs kostengünstig die Möglichkeit zu geben, ihre Experimente ins All zu bringen—Mission erfolgreich erfüllt! Die meisten Cubesats beschränken sich daher auf wissenschaftliche Aufgaben, jedoch gibt es auch kommerzielle Versionen. Sie werden gruppenweise ins All befördert, in den letzten 10 Jahren ist die Zahl der Würfel im aktiven Einsatz auf ca. 80 gewachsen. Die Firma <strong>Interorbital Systems</strong> hat gerade stolz zwei ausgebuchte Missionen für das Jahr 2014 verkündet: sie werden allein im nächsten Jahr über 60 neue Cubesats ins All transportieren.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Planetary Resources</strong>’ langfristiges Ziel ist der Erz- und Eisabbau auf/an/in Asteroiden. Derzeit arbeiten die Firma an ihrem ersten ARKYD-Satelliten—einem (auch) durch Crowdfunding finanzierten Weltraumteleskop, das nach dem Launch auch Bildungseinrichtungen zur Verfügung gestellt werden soll. Unter den Beratern und Investoren finden sich bekannte Gesichter wie Larry Page &amp; Eric Schmidt (Google), Sir Richard Branson (Virgin) und James Cameron (Filmemacher).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Nach Jahrzehnten der Stagnation und des Dahinsiechens ist endlich, endlich wieder Bewegung in die Raumfahrt gekommen; meine Liste ist keineswegs umfassend! Es gibt Firmen, die an der Technologie für Weltraumlifte arbeiten (z.B. LiftPort), Firmen, die suborbitalen Tourismus betreiben wollen/werden (z.B. Virgin Galactic) und Firmen, die den Mond als Basis oder Rohstofflieferanten im Visier haben (z.B. Golden Spike Company oder Shackleton Energy Company), und noch einige mehr. Und ja, das Meiste klingt noch nach SciFi, aber viele dieser Projekte sind schon aus der Planungsphase heraus—an ihnen wird aktiv gearbeitet. Werden sie von Erfolg gekrönt sein? Keine Ahnung. :)</p>
<p><strong>Mich stimmt das alles sehr fröhlich.</strong> Mal vom Zugang zum All und meiner Begeisterung für Raumfahrt an sich abgesehen: viele große Erfindungen der Neuzeit sind “Abfallprodukte” der Weltraumforschung, darunter kratzfeste Brillengläser, moderne Herzschrittmacher, Satelliten-gestützte Kommunikation und Insulinpumpen. All dieses Zeug kam zu einer Zeit aus den NASA-Laboren, als die meisten Menschen noch in Höhlen wohnten und mit Kohle Bilder an die Decke kratzten (ca. 1965-1985)—dementsprechend freue ich mich auf den heissen Scheiss<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, der jetzt gerade in der NewSpace-Bewegung entsteht und noch entstehen wird, und unsere Welt(en) und unseren Alltag verändern werden.</p>

<h2 id="häuser-aus-dem-drucker">Häuser aus dem Drucker</h2>
<p>Prof. Behrokh Khoshnevis von der University of Southern California entwickelt hausgroße Roboter-Drucker, die nicht Kunststoffe, sondern Beton-Faser-Gemische verwenden, und Schicht für Schicht stabile Wände hochziehen. Sein Team präsentierte schon im letzten Jahr Prototypen, die 2m hohe Wände druckten—gerade und geschwungene.</p>
<p>Laut Khoshnevis könnte mit dieser Technik ein Haus mit einer Grundfläche von ~230m2 in weniger als 24 Stunden fertiggestellt werden. (Sie ist aber noch nicht 100%ig serienreif.) Er gibt als Einsatzgebiete u.A. den sozialen Hausbau an sowie die automatisierte Errichtung von Habitaten auf anderen Planeten. In seiner Präsentation zeigte er Slums und katastrophale Behelfsunterkünfte und wies darauf hin, dass derzeit immer noch über 1 Milliarde Menschen in solch unwürdigen Zuständen leben muss. Mit Hilfe des <em>Contour Crafting</em>, wie er seine Technologie nennt, könnten ausreichend kostengünstige Häuser errichtet werden, und das weitaus schneller und Rohstoff-sparender, als es bisher möglich ist.</p>

<h2 id="photonische-prozessoren">Photonische Prozessoren</h2>
<p>Wissenschaftler an der Universität von Colorado, dem MIT und Technology Inc. haben zusammen Chips entwickelt, die auf Silizium basieren, aber photonisch arbeiten, also mit Licht. Ihre Mikroprozessoren nutzen Licht statt elektrischer Ströme, um intern zu kommunizieren, und schliessen dadurch viele Probleme aus, die bei der weiteren Miniaturisierung von Schaltkreisen auftreten. Die elektrischen Leiter fangen irgendwann an, sich gegenseitig negativ zu beeinflussen, wenn sie zu fein werden und zu nah beieinander liegen.</p>
<p>Eine der Besonderheiten der neuentwickelten Technik ist, dass diese Chips mit bereits existierenden Fertigungssystemen hergestellt werden können; eine andere, dass sie energiesparender arbeiten als ihre rein elektronischen Vorgänger. Die Forscher hoffen, dass ihre neue Technik innerhalb von 5 Jahren marktreif ist.</p>

			 <p>Donnerstagmorgen sind dafür da, um sich zu wundern, warum dieser komische Newsletter heute schon kommt, und nicht erst am Freitag, wie die letzten paar Wochen. Mysteriös!</p>
<p>Gestern durfte ich im <a href="http://www.fritz.de/neues_wort/behind_the_screens/">Interview auf Radio Fritz</a> von meinem kleinen Projekt hier erzählen. Das hat mir gefallen. Die Audio-Qualität des <a href="https://soundcloud.com/czottmann/neues-aus-der-zukunft-bei-radio-fritz">Mitschnitts</a> (4:50 min) ist teilweise etwas räudig (vielen Dank, Festnetztelefonie!), aber ich glaube, ich hab mich trotzdem ganz gut geschlagen. In dem Sinne: Hallo, liebe Fritz-Hörer! Willkommen an Bord, ich hoffe, Euch gefällts.</p>
<p>Diese Woche gehts um IBM’s virtuelle Intelligenz in der Medizin, Kakerlaken mit Rucksäcken, Zellverwandlungen und synthetisch hergestellt DNA.</p>
<p>Ich denke, in der nächsten Ausgabe muss ich mich etwas bremsen—das Tempo, das ich bis jetzt vorgelegt habe, macht mir langsam etwas zu schaffen… :) Hast Du eine Meinung dazu? Wenn ja, dann <a href="mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de">schreib mir eine Mail</a>! Ich mag Feedback.</p>
<p>Bis nächste Woche,</p>

<h2 id="dr-watson">Dr. Watson</h2>
<p>IBMs Supercomputer <strong>Watson</strong> sorgte vor ca. 2 Jahren für Aufsehen, als er in drei Spezial-Folgen von <em>Jeopardy!</em> im US-Fernsehen mit seinen beiden hochkarätigen menschlichen Gegenspielern regelrecht den Boden aufwischte. Das Ergebnis war mehr als beeindruckend, da die Kandidaten in der Sendung Begriffe erraten müssen, die oft bewußt obskur umschrieben sind—Wortspiele, (Pop-)Kultur-Referenzen und Mehrdeutigkeiten inklusive. Watson analysierte die natürlichsprachigen Hinweise, verstand ihre Feinheiten, und fand die korrekten Antworten in seiner gigantischen Datenbank.</p>
<p>Das war 2011. Watson wurde weiterentwickelt, und eines “seiner” neue Projekte ist die Onkologie. Die Ingenieure bei IBM haben Watson mit medizinischen Informationen, Texten und ca. 25.000 konkreten Fällen gefüttert, um ihm beizubringen, Diagnosepfade und Behandlungsmöglichkeiten zu verstehen. Mit seinen neugewonnenen Fähigkeiten unterstützt die Maschine in einem Pilotprojekt Ärzte in einem Krebszentrum an der Universität von Texas; sie wertet die aktuellen Behandlungsdaten von teilnehmenden Patienten aus, korreliert sie mit anderen und vergangenen Fällen, und entwickelt selbständig Rückschlüsse oder Vermutungen, die den Ärzten in ihrer Arbeit helfen. Laut Dr. Courtney DiNardo, einer Ärztin des Institutes, wurden dadurch schon lebensbedrohliche Komplikationen bei Patienten verhindert.</p>
<p>Aber das wird nicht Watsons letztes Projekt sein. Systeme, die natürliche Sprache und ihre Nuancen verstehen, und uns dabei helfen, sinnvolle Informationen aus gigantischen Datenmengen zu extrahieren: es ist sowohl ein wiederkehrendes Thema in der Science Fiction als auch ein reeller und riesiger (Zukunfts-)Markt. Die Liste an möglichen Anwendungen ist lang und wächst mit jedem Jahr, in dem die Technik schrumpft: 2011 nahm Watson noch ca. 9m³ in Anspruch, heute hat er die Größe einer Pizzaschachtel und ist 2,5× so schnell.</p>
<p>2015 passt die Technik dann vermutlich in eine Deerstalker-Mütze und hilft Detektiven, Verbrechen aufgrund von verwirrenden Hinweisen aufzuklären. Cool.</p>

<h2 id="cyborg-insekten">Cyborg-Insekten</h2>
<p>Vor einem Jahr machte ein Team um Dr. Alper Bozkurt von der North Carolina State University Furore, als sie drahtlos kontrollierbare Kakerlaken vorstellten. Die Schaben wurden mit einem “biologischen Interface” versehen und konnten fortan fremdgesteuert werden. (Die Meldung schwankte auf meiner persönlichen Skala irgendwo zwischen “freaky” und “crazy-knorke”.)</p>
<p>Letzte Woche dann stellte das Team sozusagen Stufe 2 des Projekts vor: eine Software, die die Steuerung eines Kakerlaken-Schwarms koordiniert. Die Idee dabei ist, dass man den kleinen Rackern Sensoren auf den Panzer klebt und sie dort als Scouts einsetzt, wo Menschen nicht so einfach hinkommen. (Zum Beispiel in Katastrophengebieten oder eingestürzten Häusern.) Die Biobots krabbeln durch das Zielgebiet, und ihre Elektronik funkt die eigene Position in Relation zu den Kollegen an den steuernden Computer, der aus diesen Informationen dann ein dreidimensionales Modell des auszukundschaftenden Ortes erstellt. Weitere Einsatzgebiete ergeben sich durch den Austausch der Sensoren im Rucksack der Insekten (radioaktive, chemische, Kameras etc.).</p>
<p>Übrigens, einen solchen “Kakerlaken-Cyborg-Bausatz” kann man ab November im freien (US-)Handel erwerben. Es heisst “RoboRoach” und kostet $99. Heh.</p>

<h2 id="neue-leber-aus-fettzellen">Neue Leber aus Fettzellen</h2>
<p>An der Uni Stanford wurde ein Verfahren entwickelt, mit dem in weniger als 9 Tagen körpereigene Fettzellen in Leberzellen umgewandelt werden können, um mit diesen eine kranke Leber wieder aufzubauen. (Eine gesunde Leber kann sich normalerweise selbst regenerieren, aber bei Lebervergiftungen oder Beeinträchtigungen z.B. durch Alkoholismus kann diese Fähigkeit unter Umständen nicht mehr ausreichen—die Leber stirbt, und mit ihr der Mensch.) Die Umwandlung geht dabei nicht über das Stammzellenstadium, sie erfolgt direkt; die Ausgangszellen können z.B. durch eine Fettabsaugung gewonnen werden. Im Rahmen der Studie wurden die neugewonnenen menschlichen Leberzellen an kompatiblen Mäusen getestet, und funktionierten prächtig.</p>
<p>Die Wissenschaftler hoffen auf klinische Tests in 2-3 Jahren. Sie sehen die Methode als gute Alternative zur Lebertransplantation, u.A. auch, weil die gewonnenen Leberzellen des Patienten körpereigene Zellen sind (also keine Immunsuppression nötig wäre) und bei Bedarf ohne längere Wartezeit relativ schnell hergestellt werden können.</p>

<h2 id="craig-venters-bio-drucker">Craig Venter&rsquo;s Bio-Drucker</h2>
<p>Einer der Väter der synthetischen Biologie, der Genetiker Dr. J. Craig Venter, hat den Prototypen seines sog. “Digital Biological Converter” (DBC) vorgestellt—ein Gerät, das übers Netz DNA-Sequenzen empfangen und diese synthetisch herstellen kann. Der Teil mit dem Internet ist wichtig, weil Venter das, was die Maschine macht, als “biologische Teleportation” bezeichnet. Er stellt sich eine Zukunft vor, wo z.B. Medikamente nicht mehr per Kurier versandt, sondern nur noch als “Blaupausen” an die Geräte geschickt werden, wo sie dann synthetisch hergestellt werden.</p>
<p>Im Augenblick kann der DBC nur DNA produzieren, aber Venter und sein Team arbeiten daran, ihn auch Proteine, Viren und lebende Zellen herstellen zu lassen. Dr. Venter wies darauf hin, dass manche existierenden Impfstoffe ohnehin nur aus DNA-Molekülen bestehen, und das Gerät somit jetzt schon einen praktischen Anwendungszweck bietet. Ein weiteres (noch theoretisches) Einsatzgebiet sieht er z.B. in zukünftigen Mars-Kolonien oder auch der Raumfahrt, wo benötigte Medikamente digital zusammengestellt, als Datenpaket übermittelt und vor Ort hergestellt werden könnten.</p>
<p>Das Projekt wird von DARPA unterstützt; Venters Firma <em>Synthetic Genomics</em> arbeitet an Weiterentwicklungen und der Serienreife des Geräts, so dass es irgendwann beispielsweise in Krankenhäusern eingesetzt werden kann.</p>

			 <p>Freitagmorgen sind dafür da, um im Büro zu sitzen, so zu tun als würde man arbeiten, und sich insgeheim auf die Zukunft und ihre tollen Newsletter zu freuen. (Und das Wochenende.) FAKT!</p>

<h2 id="fortschritt-auf-dem-feld-der-kernfusion">Fortschritt auf dem Feld der Kernfusion</h2>
<p>In der National Ignition Facility in Livermore, Kalifornien, wurde ein großer Schritt auf dem Weg zur stabilen Kernfusion getan. Erstmals in der Geschichte dieser (noch nicht praxisreifen) Art der Energieerzeugung ist es gelungen, mehr Energie zu erzeugen, als der Prozess verbrauchte. Das ist durchaus bedeutsam, obschon noch keine Zündung erreicht wurde. (Die Zündung ist der Punkt, an dem die Reaktion so stabil ist, dass keine weitere Energie von aussen mehr notwendig ist, um den Prozess am Laufen zu halten.)</p>
<p>Ich finde diese Nachricht insofern sehr cool, da sie sich mit einem meiner Lieblingsthemen überschneidet, der Raumfahrt: es gibt weltweit einige Forschungsprojekte, deren Ziel es ist, Fusionstriebwerke für Raumschiffe zu entwickeln. Auf zum Mars, Freunde!</p>

<h2 id="innovation-in-bürgerhand">Innovation in Bürgerhand</h2>
<p>Früher war “Forschung” für mich immer etwas, das irgendwie sehr weit weg war. <em>“Amerikanische Wissenschaftler haben herausgefunden, dass…”</em>—die Älteren erinnern sich sicher noch an “Abenteuer Forschung” im ZDF. (An dieser Stelle mal ein großes Dankeschön an Dr. Joachim Bublath für all die Inspiration über die Jahre hinweg.) Die Gelder für wissenschaftliche Projekte wurden meistens von staatlichen Stellen zur Verfügung gestellt, manchmal von privaten Stiftungen, oft von der Industrie.</p>
<p>Heute geschieht die meiste Forschung zwar immer noch nicht in meiner direkten Nähe, aber immer öfter gehen Wissenschaftler neue Wege in der Finanzierung, und versuchen dabei, mich als Normalbürger an Bord zu holen. Es findet eine Demokratisierung statt: über Plattformen wie indiegogo, Sciencestarter, Kickstarter oder microryza wenden sich die Verantwortlichen direkt an interessierte Bürger auf der ganzen Welt. Sie präsentieren ihre Projekte und bitten die Welt um mehr oder weniger kleine Beträge; das Funding-Ziel ist klar definiert, und nur wenn sie in der Vorstellungsphase genug Menschen/Geldgeber für ihr Ding begeistern konnten, wird das Projekt finanziert—es gilt das Alles-oder-Nichts-Prinzip.</p>
<p>Ich finde es super, denn ich kann endlich die Projekte fördern, die mir am Herzen liegen, wie z.B. diese:</p>
<ul>
<li>einen Prototypen für einen <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2027072188/plasma-jet-electric-thrusters-for-spacecraft">neuartigen Antrieb für Raumfahrzeuge</a> (Funding erfolgreich)</li>
<li>einen <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/i-am-a-little-mouse-and-i-want-to-live-longer?locale=de">Langzeitversuch zur Steigerung der Lebenserwartungen von Mäusen</a> (Fundingsziel erreicht, aber die Funding-Phase läuft noch!)</li>
<li>ein <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/391496725/the-slingatron-building-a-railroad-to-space">mechanisches Hochgeschwindigkeits-Launcher-System</a> für die Beförderung von Frachten in den Erdorbit (Funding nicht erfolgreich)</li>
<li>ein <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1038658656/rdtnorg-radiation-detection-hardware-network-in-ja">Netzwerk in Japan zur Erfassung von Strahlung</a> (Funding erfolgreich)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/872281861/final-frontier-designs-3g-space-suit">einen Raumanzug</a> für die kommerzielle Raumfahrtindustrie (Funding erfolgreich)</li>
<li>Experimente zur <a href="https://www.microryza.com/projects/can-we-biologically-extend-the-range-of-human-vision-into-the-near-infrared">Erweiterung der menschlichen Sehfähigkeit im infraroten Spektrum</a> (Funding erfolgreich)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ich</strong> kann Wissenschaft unterstützen, die in meinem Sinne ist, und muss nicht zwangsläufig darauf hoffen, dass Regierungen oder die Industrie ein Feld als vielversprechend genug betrachten, um Forschung darin zu fördern—großartig. Mitmachen! Interessante und lohnende Projekte gibt es genug.</p>

<h2 id="metalle-im-3d-druck">Metalle im 3D-Druck</h2>
<p>Die europäische Weltraumagentur ESA und die EU entwickeln zusammen mit Partner in Industrie und Hochschulen die ersten 3D-Drucker, die im industriellen Maßstab komplexe metallische Strukturen herstellen können. Bisher wurden im 3D-Druck primär Objekte aus Kunststoffen gefertigt, die ESA präsentierte jetzt in London Druckverfahren für metallische Strukturen, die Temperaturen bis 1000°C widerstehen können. Die Pressemitteilung erklärt die Bedeutsamkeit ganz gut:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Durch drei dimensionales Drucken, bisher auch unter dem Begriff
“additive Fertigung” bekannt, können komplexe Strukturen entworfen
werden, die nicht mit herkömmlichen Gieß- und Bearbeitungsmethoden
zu bewerkstelligen sind. Es entstehen kaum oder gar keine
Abfälle, und durch die Reduzierung der einzelnen Arbeitsschritte
der Fertigungs kette bieten sich ganz erhebliche
Einsparmöglichkeiten.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Die Technologie “3D-Druck” wird Industrie und Alltag in den nächsten Jahren noch gewaltig beeinflussen, und das Drucken von Metall ist ohne Frage ein Meilenstein auf diesem Weg. Das sieht auch die US-IT-Forschungsfirma Gartner so: in ihren Vorhersagen für die nächsten 7 Jahre taucht 3D-Druck mehrfach als eine der disruptivsten Technologien auf. (Fremdwort!)</p>
<p>Siehe dazu auch <em>“Ich druck’ mir eine Raumstation”</em> in NadZ #1—die ESA hat auch den Einsatz von Druckern im Weltraum fest im Blick.</p>

<h2 id="mit-nanopartikeln-gegen-den-darmkrebs">Mit Nanopartikeln gegen den Darmkrebs</h2>
<p>An der Cornell University in New York wurde ein minimalinvasives Verfahren gegen Darmkrebs entwickelt, bei dem Gold- und Eisenoxid-Nanopartikel miteinander verbunden und an Antikörper angedockt wurden. Im Körper angelangt gehen die Antikörper auf die Krebszellen los; an der richtigen Position angelangt werden die Nanopartikel mit infrarotem Licht beschossen und dadurch auf ca. 50°C erwärmt, was die Krebszellen abtötet. Die Goldpartikel arbeiten als Hitzeleiter und ihre Eisenoxid-Kollegen erlauben es, mittels MRT und CT die Position der Antikörper bestimmen zu können. Tumore werden damit zwar nicht komplett abgetötet, aber zumindest substantiell eingedämmt.</p>
<p>Die Wissenschaftler weisen explizit darauf hin, dass diese Methode keine Science Fiction, sondern <em>“medizinische Realität”</em> ist. Mir war nicht klar, dass “Nanopartikel an Antikörper anhängen” schon ein Ding ist, das existiert. Verdammt cool!</p>

<h2 id="dynamisches-aus-boston">Dynamisches aus Boston</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.bostondynamics.com/">Boston Dynamics</a> ist eine Firma in den USA, die sich mit Robotik beschäftigt, speziell damit, Robotern das Laufen beizubringen und sie mobiler zu machen. BD ging 1992 aus dem Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) hervor. Sie ist <a href="http://zukun.tf/16r6VH5">DARPA</a>-finanziert und hat mehrere unglaublich coole Projekte am Start.</p>
<p>Ich wurde vor ein paar Jahren auf Boston Dynamics aufmerksam, als Videos ihres vierbeinigen BigDog-Roboters die Runde machten, die seine Reflexe zeigten ( <a href="http://youtu.be/3gi6Ohnp9x8">beeindruckendes/heiteres Video</a>, 2:12 min). BigDog wird primär fürs Militär entwickelt; sein aktueller Nachfolger LS3 ( <em>“Legged Squad Support System”</em>) ist ein Lastenträger für unwegsames Gelände, der überall dort hingehen kann, wo auch Marines und Soldaten zu Fuß hinkommen—Steigungen, Geröll, matschige Wege, Schnee und Wasser inklusive. ( <a href="http://youtu.be/R7ezXBEBE6U">Tolles Video aus dem Gelände</a>, 1:30 min.) LS3 wertet das vor ihm liegende Terrain aus, um seinem Führer automatisch zu folgen, und kann bei Bedarf auch selbständig GPS-Koordinaten ansteuern. Er schleppt bis zu 180 kg, der eingebaute Verbrennungsmotor hat genug Treibstoff für 24h bzw. 32 km.</p>
<p>Neben BigDog arbeitet die Firma noch an anderen interessanten Projekten, u.A. an…</p>
<ul>
<li>dem humanoiden <a href="http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_Atlas.html">Atlas</a> (irres <a href="http://youtu.be/SD6Okylclb8">Video von Atlas auf Geröll</a>, 1:04 min)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_rhex.html">RHex</a>, einem sechsbeinigen Aufklärer ( <a href="http://youtu.be/ISznqY3kESI">Video</a>, 1:53 min)</li>
<li>dem Kletterer <a href="http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_rise.html">Rise</a>, der Wände und Bäume bezwingt ( <a href="http://youtu.be/MZGGL20g99A">Video</a>, 1:28 min)</li>
</ul>
<p>Boston Dynamics’ neueste Kreation ist der Vierbeiner WildCat, der diverse Untergründe schnell bezwingen kann. Seine momentane Höchstgeschwindigkeit ist 25 km/h—das <a href="http://youtu.be/wE3fmFTtP9g">sehr coole Vorstellungsvideo</a> (2:09 min) sagt mir, dass mein Kindheitstraum nicht so abwegig war: WildCat + Sattel = Roboterpony! Und auch, dass wir in ein paar Jahren wahrscheinlich hochmobile robotische Helfer im Katastrophenschutz sehen werden, und der Industrie, und und und…</p>
<p>Ich gebe zu, die “freilaufenden” Maschinen klingen derzeit noch wie <a href="http://derstandard.at/2131890/Fichtenmoped">Fichtenmopeds</a> und sind wenig elegant. Aber das wird nicht so bleiben, und neue Antriebs- und Batterietechniken werden früher oder später auch Anwendung in diesem Feld finden.</p>

<h2 id="startschuss-fürs-human-brain-project">Startschuss fürs Human Brain Project!</h2>
<p>Diese Woche sah den offiziellen Beginn eines der für mich vielversprechendsten Projekte in der Menschheitsgeschichte: das <a href="https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/"><em>Human Brain Project</em></a> (kurz HBP). <a href="http://zukun.tf/19atpfS">Wikipedia beschreibt es</a> kurz und bündig so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Das Human Brain Project ist ein Großprojekt der Europäischen Kommission, welches das gesamte Wissen über <strong>das menschliche Hirn</strong> zusammenfassen und <strong>mittels computerbasierten Modellen und Simulationen nachbilden</strong> soll. Als Ergebnis werden neue Erkenntnisse über das menschliche Hirn und seine Erkrankungen sowie neue Computer- und Robotertechnologien erwartet. […] Am Projekt sind über 80 europäische und internationale Forschungseinrichtungen beteiligt. Es ist auf zehn Jahre ausgelegt und soll 1,19 Milliarden Euro kosten.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Das HBP wird seit ca. 1 Jahr vorbereitet, und konzentriert sich auf drei Forschungsfelder: <em>Future Neuroscience</em> (Neurowissenschaften der Zukunft), <em>Future Medicine</em> (Heilkunde der Zukunft) und <em>Future Computing</em> (neues, äh, Komputering?). Es wird in den nächsten 2,5 Jahren sechs Forschungsplattformen entwickeln, die in die Bereiche der Neuroinformatik, Neurorobotik, Hirnsimulation, Supercomputer, medizinische Informatik und <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorph">neuromorphe Computer</a> fallen. Diese Plattformen stehen dann ab 2016 den beteiligten Forschungseinrichtungen zur Verfügung; die Forschungergebnisse werden explizit und aktiv interdisziplinär ausgetauscht.</p>
<p><strong>Ich glaube, nie zuvor gab es eine derartige koordinierte Initiative zur Erforschung des Hirns.</strong> Wir—als Spezies—wollen endlich detailliert wissen, wie und warum es so gut funktioniert! Und auch wenn noch nicht wirklich absehbar ist, was 2023 unterm Strich herauskommen wird, so kann man doch davon ausgehen, dass das im HBP neu erlangte Wissen viele Felder beflügeln wird. Wir werden Krankheiten besser verstehen und bekämpfen können, denn die medizinische Diagnostik und Hirnforschung kann beim HBP nur gewinnen. Und dank des besseren Verständnisses der Arbeitsweise des Hirns werden sich Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien rasant weiterentwickeln—sehr wahrscheinlich sehen wir in ein paar Jahren neuronale Chips, eventuell bessere Hirn/Computer-Schnittstellen, möglicherweise smartere Roboter usw.</p>
<p>The mind boggles.</p>

<h2 id="bakterien-minizoo">Bakterien-Minizoo</h2>
<p>Forschern aus Austin, Texas, ist es gelungen, <a href="http://zukun.tf/1b8nwPA">mikroskopisch kleine Minikäfige für Bakterien herzustellen</a>. Dazu werden mit einem Laser in einer Art von 3D-Druck Protein-Strukturen um die Bakterien herum in Gelatin erzeugt. Diese Strukturen können dann frei bewegt werden, um gezielter und schneller das Verhalten zwischen verschiedenen Bakterienkulturen testen zu können.</p>
<p>Den Wissenschaftlern zufolge erlaubt das völlig neue Arten von Experimenten, in denen die Gegebenheiten in den verschiedensten biologischen Umgebungen nachgestellt werden können, z.B. die im menschlichen Körper. Eines der Langzeitziele der Gruppe ist es, besser Infektionen bekämpfen zu können.</p>
<p>Käfige für Bakterien aus Proteinen… Käfige für <em>Bakterien</em> aus <em>Proteinen</em>. Und ich hatte als Kind schon Probleme, meine Schildkröte so einzusperren, dass sie mir nicht dauernd davonrannte.</p>

<h2 id="ultrahaptics-taktiles-feedback-in-der-luft">UltraHaptics: taktiles Feedback in der Luft</h2>
<p>Touchscreen, Maus, Keyboard, Trackpad, Joystick: das sind Eingabegeräte, die jeder kennt. Sie bieten direktes taktiles Feedback—ich merke, dass ich das Gerät berühre, und bei einigen Geräten bekomme ich auch Rückmeldung, dass etwas passiert, z.B. bei einem Joystick mit Force-Feedback, oder einem Smartphone, das meine Eingabe mit einer Vibration quittiert.</p>
<p>Bei berührungslosen Eingabegeräten wird es schwieriger; sei es vor einer <a href="http://www.xbox.com/de-DE/KINECT">Xbox mit Kinect</a> oder mit einem <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com">Leap Motion</a>—die Information, dass meine Bewegungen erkannt wurden, bekomme ich lediglich auf dem Bildschirm, die Bewegung an sich erfolgt ohne spürbares Feedback.</p>
<p>Dieses Problem hat jetzt (nach eigenen Angaben) ein Team der <a href="http://big.cs.bris.ac.uk/">University of Bristol’s Interaction and Graphics (BIG)</a>-Gruppe gelöst. Ihr neues System namens <a href="http://zukun.tf/19kORi9">UltraHaptics</a> gibt dem Nutzer taktiles Feedback <em>in der Luft</em>, d.h. der Nutzer spürt, dass er etwas berührt, ohne tatsächlich etwas zu berühren. Dazu gibt ihr Gerät mehrere Ultraschallwellen in verschiedenen Frequenzen an, die sich in der Luft treffen bzw. überlagern, und dadurch spürbar werden.</p>
<p>(Nach §4 des DNLGB (Deutsches NewsLetter-Gesetzbuch) bin ich verpflichtet, an dieser Stelle den Film <a href="http://zukun.tf/19kTzMW"><em>Minority Report</em></a> zu erwähnen, auch wenn ich kein Fan von Tiny Tom bin. Hnnnngh.)</p>
<p>UltraHaptics wird heute auf dem <a href="http://oldwww.acm.org/uist/uist2013/">UIST-Symposium 2013</a> in St. Andrews, UK, vorgestellt. Noch weiss man nichts über die mögliche Verknüpfung mit den o.g. Eingabesystemen (Kinect etc.), aber man kann davon ausgehen, dass da recht schnell etwas passieren wird.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus-Video:</strong> Wer sehen möchte, wie Profis mit einem berührungslosen System wie dem Leap Motion arbeiten, schaue sich <a href="http://youtu.be/xNqs_S-zEBY">dieses feine Video von SpaceX</a> (3:49 min) an, in dem die Firma ihre LM-gestützten Designprozesse erklärt. Heiss!</p>

<p>Mein persönliches Highlight in dieser Ausgabe ist das kurze Profil zu SpaceX’ <em>Grasshopper</em>-Projekt. Bei SpaceX muss ich immer aufpassen, dass ich mich vor Begeisterung nicht überschlage—diese Firma setzt bei mir alle Häkchen in den richtigen Checkboxen. :)</p>
<p>Hinter den Kulissen experimentiere ich mit dem Newsletter-Format noch etwas herum. Da nicht jede Woche mit unglaublich großartigen Meldungen gespickt ist, wie mir in der letzten Tagen klar wurde, werde ich hin und wieder auch mal Meldungen vergangener Monate aufgreifen und/oder ein Thema etwas umfassender behandeln. Eventuell gibts in der nächsten Woche auch eine Handvoll Kurzmeldungen (ein Link + ein Satz) zusätzlich; wir werden sehen.</p>

<h2 id="anti-pilz-medikament-tötet-hiv-zellen-in-zellkulturen">Anti-Pilz-Medikament tötet HIV-Zellen (in Zellkulturen)</h2>
<p>Ein weitverbreitetes Antimykotikum (Arzneimittel zur Behandlung von Pilzinfektionen) namens <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclopirox">Ciclopirox</a> tötet effektiv HIV-infizierte Zellen ab, wie <a href="http://news.rutgers.edu/news-release/drug-found-eradicate-hiv-permanently-infected-cells/20130924#.UkG3R7z8WMI">eine neue Studie der Rutgers New Jersey Medical School</a> belegt. Anders als bei herkömmlichen Anti-HIV-Blockern wäre ein Patient nicht ein Leben lang auf ein entsprechendes Medikament angewiesen, sondern könnte es nach der Behandlung absetzen, da es die Infektion nicht nur eingedämmt und unterdrückt, sondern umfassend ausgemerzt wird. Ciclopirox geht den virulenteren, ansteckenderen Haupterreger von AIDS an, HIV-1.</p>
<p>Die Studie bezieht sich auf Experimente an Zellkulturen, Tests mit menschlichen Patienten stehen noch aus. Da der Arzneistoff jedoch schon seit Jahrzehnten in einer Vielzahl von Medikamenten eingesetzt wird, sind die Forscher zuversichtlich, dass derlei Tests schnell von den Behörden zugelassen werden.</p>

<p>Die Forscher vom <a href="http://www.ric.org/research/centers/bionic-medicine/">Center for Bionic Medicine in Chicago, USA,</a> konzentrierten sich in der Entwicklung auf die Nervenbahnen, über die der Körper Steuersignale zum Knie und zum Knöchel des Patienten schickt—die “Empfänger” mögen zwar nicht mehr vorhanden sein, das Hirn sendet die Signale aber weiterhin aus. Das künstliche Bein registriert diese Nervenimpulse über Sensoren am Beinstumpf, wertet sie aus, und setzt die Informationen in aktive Bewegungen im neuen Knie und Knöchel um.</p>
<p>Der Prototyp erlaubt es seinem Träger, Steigungen und Stufen zu nehmen, sowie sich zu setzen und aufzustehen, ohne irgendwelche Schalter oder Knöpfe bedienen zu müssen. Das ist ziemlich weit weg ist von üblichen, einfachen Prothesen. Dem Träger wird damit sehr viel Freiheit und Lebensqualität zurückgegeben. ( <a href="http://youtu.be/b3YgoYNgiMQ">Das kurze Video zum Projekt</a> (0:49 min) ist sehr beeindruckend.)</p>
<p><strong>Bonus-Links:</strong> Der Markt für “intelligente” Prothesen ist (leider) größer als man denkt. Objektiv betrachtet gibt es in diesem Feld in den letzten Jahren aber wirklich tolle Entwicklungen. Für mehr “Whoa!”-Momente empfehle ich, <a href="http://www.ossur.com/?PageID=15767">Össur’s POWER KNEE</a> anzuschauen (“User Stories”!) oder auch <a href="http://youtu.be/it1A4qT1cHs">MIT’s Hugh Herr’s <em>Google Zeitgeist</em>-Präsentation</a> (Video, 13:39 min).</p>

<h2 id="energie-aus-abwasser">Energie aus Abwasser</h2>
<p>Ein interdisziplinäres Team von Technikern an der Stanford University <a href="http://zukun.tf/17oD2Hg">hat einen “mikrobischen Akku” entwickelt</a>, der auf natürlich vorkommenden Bakterien basiert, die organische Abfälle in Biotreibstoff und Elektrizität umwandeln.</p>
<p>Der Prototyp der Forscher besteht aus einem Glas mit Abwasser, in dem zwei Elektroden stecken, eine negativ und eine positiv geladene. Die sog. exoelektrogenischen Bakterien kletten sich an die negativ geladene Anode, und geben während des Mümmelns Elektrizität ab, die von der positiv geladenen Kathode eingefangen wird.</p>
<p>Wenn wir Menschen eine Sache extrem gut beherrschen, dann ist es die Produktion von organischem Müll in allen Formen und Farben. (Menschen sind toll.) Dem Stanford-Team schwebt dementsprechend auch ein möglicher Einsatz in Klärwerken vor—ihr Prototyp erlaubt die Rückgewinnung von ca. 30% der im Abwasser gespeicherten Energie, und sie denken, dass bei einem industriellen Einsatz ihrer Idee diese Energie z.B. auch von den Klärwerken selbst genutzt werden könnte.</p>
<p>Bis dahin stehen aber noch einige weiterführende Experimente und Verfeinerungen an. So besteht derzeit u.A. des Prototyp’s Kathode aus Silveroxid, die Verwendung von Silber im großen Stil aber wäre wenig wirtschaftlich.</p>

<h2 id="transparente-photovoltaik">Transparente Photovoltaik</h2>
<p>Das französische Unternehmen <a href="http://sunpartnergroup.com/">SunPartner Technologies</a> hat ein durchsichtiges Material namens <a href="http://zukun.tf/GBwJqh"><em>Wysips Crystal</em></a> vorgestellt, das natürliches und künstliches Licht in photovoltaischen Strom erzeugt und vom Hersteller für den Einsatz z.B. in Smartphones und Tablets vorgesehen ist. Das Material wäre Teil des Displays; SunPartner gibt an, dass eine solche Schicht bei 90% Transparenz ca. 2,5 Milliwatt/cm² erzeugen würde, was ~3 min zusätzlicher Akkuleistung bei 10 min Lichteinstrahlung bedeuten würde.</p>
<p>SunPartner hat im Juli die <a href="http://zukun.tf/GBx24w">Zusammenarbeit mit dem chinesischen Elektronikhersteller TCL Communication bekanntgegeben</a>, der die Wysips-Technologie in seinen Smartphones einsetzen will. Und im Aerospace-Sektor kommt das verwandte <a href="http://zukun.tf/GBwTOt"><em>Wysips Glass</em></a> der Firma in <a href="http://zukun.tf/GBwWdh">stromerzeugenden Flugzeugfenstern von Vision Systems</a> (PDF) zum Einsatz (die sog. <em>Energia</em>-Fenster werden auf der Flugzeugmesse NBAA 2013 Ende Oktober vorgestellt).</p>
<p>Je mehr ich über diese Technologie nachdenke, desto cooler finde ich sie. Fenster und Glasflächen sind überall, ich sehe da so viele Möglichkeiten…</p>

<h2 id="wirtschaftlichkeit-in-space">Wirtschaftlichkeit… IN SPACE</h2>
<p>Was sieht aus wie eine 32 m hohe, schlanke Tonne, und hat vier Beine plus Raketenantrieb? Ein Grashüpfer! (Tusch.) Das <em>Grasshopper</em>-Projekt von <a href="http://www.spacex.com/">Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX)</a> ist der experimentelle Prototyp eines wiederverwendbaren suborbitalen Transportfahrzeugs, sozusagen einer “Mehrfach-Rakete”. Seit 2011 wird daran gearbeitet, und seit dem ersten Take-Off im letzten Jahr hat <em>Grasshopper</em> insgesamt schon 7 Testflüge hinter sich gebracht. Die Flüge bestehen im Moment noch aus mehr oder weniger kurzen “Hüpfern”: <em>Grasshopper</em> zündet, steigt ein paar Meter in die Luft und <strong>landet selbständig und aufrecht stehend</strong>. Die Flugzeit betrug bisher je nach Test zwischen 3 und 68 sek bei einer max. Flughöhe von 325 m. <a href="http://youtu.be/eGimzB5QM1M">Hier ist ein sehenswertes Video des Testflugs im Juni</a> (1:26 min).</p>
<p>Wozu der Aufwand? Weil es absolut unwirtschaftlich ist, “Wegwerf-Raketen” zu bauen. Laut dem Gründer von SpaceX, Elon Musk, machen Treibstoff und Sauerstoff nur ca. 0.35% der Kosten eines Raketenstarts aus ( <a href="http://youtu.be/3B5av0BOajU">Video</a>, 1:36 min). Die restlichen $56,3 mio für den Start einer <a href="http://www.spacex.com/falcon9">SpaceX- <em>Falcon 9</em>-Rakete</a> gehen für das eigentliche Gefährt drauf. (Musk vergleicht traditionelle Startmethoden auch mit dem Verschrotten einer 747 nach ihrem ersten Flug.) Das erklärte Ziel von SpaceX ist deshalb auch die Wiederverwendbarkeit der Raketen—die einzelnen Stufen würden nach dem Abliefern ihrer Ladung nicht in der Atmosphäre verglühen oder ins Meer stürzen, sondern eigenständig für den nächsten Einsatz zur Basis zurückkehren. Je öfter sie benutzt werden können, desto niedriger werden dementsprechend auch die Kosten pro Start. Elon Musk ist fest davon überzeugt, <a href="http://zukun.tf/GBxiR3">dass die Menschheit eine multiplanetare Spezies werden muss</a>, um auf lange Sicht zu überleben, und komplett wiederverwendbare Raumfahrzeuge sind dafür unerlässlich.</p>
<p>(Ich stimme ihm in diesem Punkt übrigens 100%ig zu! Allerdings hat er <em>etwas</em> mehr Geld, Talent und Visionen als ich, und arbeitet darum aktiv an diesem weltbewegenenden Projekt, während ich einen Newsletter herausbringe. Hmm. Äpfel und Birnen… Äpfel und Birnen!)</p>
<p>SpaceX entwickelt derzeit die nächste Version des <em>Grasshopper</em> (“1.1”), die neun statt einem Raketenmotor besitzt, sowie größer und komplexer als ihr Vorgänger ist. (Das Design der Prototypen wird damit der <em>Falcon 9</em>-Rakete angepasst, die schon mit Wiederverwendbarkeit im Hinterkopf entwickelt wurde und <a href="http://zukun.tf/1holDzR">derzeit u.A. die internationale Raumstation <em>ISS</em> beliefert</a>.) Für diesen erweiterten Prototypen sind die ersten Testflüge für Anfang 2014 geplant, er soll Flughöhen bis zu 91 km erreichen. Ich bin sehr gespannt!</p>
<p><strong>Bonus-Link:</strong> <a href="http://youtu.be/HXdjxPY2j_0">ein Video vom <em>Grasshopper</em>-Test im August</a> (1:10 min), bei dem laterale Manövrierfähigkeit sowie Panikmache unter Kühen getestet wurden. Fachwelt und Internet waren gleichermaßen entzückt.</p>

			 <p>Hi, ich bin Carlo Zottmann, und ich werde 140 Jahre alt, mindestens. Das heisst, ich habe noch 100 Jahre vor mir, hoffentlich mehr.</p>
<p>Wenn ich diese Vermutung und Hoffnung äussere, schlagen mir meistens Heiterkeit und Unverständnis entgegen. <em>“Opa Erwin ist 72 Jahre alt und kann kaum noch kriechen, und Tante Emmi ist 81 und seit 5 Jahren dement, und wovon soll ich leben, wenn ich ab Mitte 60 keine Arbeit mehr habe, etc. Warum würdest Du das wollen? Du bist ja verrückt, Carlo.”</em></p>
<p>Bin ich das? Ich sage ja nicht, dass ich ab dem 70. Lebensjahr pflegebedürftig sein möchte. Ich gehe davon aus, dass wir fitter und gesünder altern werde als vorherige Generationen. Die Chancen dafür stehen ausgezeichnet, wenn man sich die Entwicklungen in der Biotechnologie, in Genetik und Langlebigkeitsforschung anschaut.</p>
<p><em>“Ja, aber die Menschheit kämpft jetzt schon ums Überleben, in 50-100 Jahren wird das alles noch viel furchtbarer sein, warum willst Du Dir das antun?”</em> Weil ich die Forschung und Erfolge in grüner Energietechnik, in Robotik, in künstlicher Intelligenz, in kommerzieller Raumfahrt usw. beobachte, und mich das alles sehr, sehr hoffnungsvoll stimmt. Die Erde wird überleben, wir werden nicht ewig <em>nur</em> hier leben, und das würde ich gern noch miterleben. Du nicht?</p>
<p>Vor ein paar Monaten dämmerte es mir dann: es gibt unglaublich viele gute Nachrichten, von denen allerdings kaum jemand etwas erfährt. Unsere Nachrichten berichten nur von Problemen, Katastrophen, Mord, Krieg und der Bundestagswahl, und wenn das alles ist, das man aufnimmt, wird das eigene Weltbild u.U. negativ verzerrt. Aber die (für mich) wichtigeren, interessanteren, zukunftsbejahenderen Themen, die optimistisch stimmen, die muss man mit der Lupe suchen, und das ist tragisch.</p>
<p>Ich denke, ich freue mich mehr als viele Andere auf die Zukunft, weil ich mehrere Forschungsrichtungen im Auge behalte, und deren Erfolge nicht separat, sondern als Gesamtbild betrachte. Wir leben in einer Zeit, in der wir funktionierende Mäuseherzen im Labor züchten; in der <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/auto/selbstfahrende-autos-rollende-rechenzentren-1.1755403">selbstfahrende Automobile</a> keine SciFi mehr sind; in der eine die größten Techfirmen der Welt <a href="http://business.time.com/2013/09/18/google-extend-human-life/">den Kampf gegen das Altern aufnimmt</a>; in der hochentwickelte <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/prosthetics/darpa-pushes-bionic-arm-boundaries-15686071">Arm-Prothesen für verwundete Veteranen</a> mit nahezu voller Beweglichkeit existieren; in der <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/17/elon-musk-mission-mars-spacex">einer der größten lebenden Erfinder/Macher den Mars als Lebensraum anvisiert</a>, ohne dafür von aller Welt ausgelacht zu werden. Vor 20 Jahren war das alles noch undenkbar, vor 10 Jahren war lag es noch “in weiter Ferne”, und heute? Heute frage ich mich, wie die Welt 2023 oder 2033 aussehen wird.</p>
<p>Die These des <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change"><em>Accelerating Change</em>, des sich beschleunigenden Wandels</a>: in meinen Augen ist sie korrekt. Das Tempo der technischen Entwicklung ist keine gerade Linie, es ist eine steiler werdende Kurve. Die berühmte Katze ist nicht nur aus dem Sack, nein, sie hat mittlerweile auch mehrere extrem süße Babies bekommen.</p>
<p><strong>Ich will meinen Optimismus teilen, und werde in <em>Neues aus der Zukunft</em> jede Woche 4-5 Projekte vorstellen, die in den letzten Tagen meine Aufmerksamkeit erregt und mich aufgebaut haben.</strong> Ich will verständlich schreiben, und nicht <em>zu</em> technisch werden. Und ich hoffe, ich kann damit Deine Neugier wecken und auch Deine Laune verbessern.</p>
<p>Bleib optimistisch—es gibt gute Gründe dafür. Und wenn Dir diese Ausgabe gefällt, empfiehl sie bitte weiter!</p>
<p>—Carlo.</p>

<h2 id="da-ist-musike-drin">Da ist Musike drin</h2>
<p>Ein Forscherteam der <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/">Harvard University in Cambridge</a> (Mass., USA) hat ein biokompatibles, leitfähiges Material entwickelt, das ionische Ladungen transportiert. Die angelegten Spannungen werden also nicht von Elektronen übertragen, wie man es z.B. von Küchenmixern, iPads und Flugzeugträgern kennt, sondern von Ionen, wie es im menschlichen Körper geschieht. Das Material ist darüber hinaus auch noch weit dehnbar, ohne seinen Widerstand zu vergrößern, was beim möglichen Einsatz in Form von künstlichen Muskeln oder Haut sehr praktisch ist. Die Wissenschaftler haben hier klar sog. <em>“soft machines”</em> im Auge: biologische Systeme, wie sie in der Natur vorkommen.</p>
<p>Um die Eigenschaften ihres neuen Materials zu demonstrieren, hat das Team als Konzeptstudie einen ionischen, transparenten Stretch-Lautsprecher entwickelt. Mit seinem interessanten Sandwichaufbau (eine Schicht Salzwassergel, eine Schicht Gummi, eine Schicht Salzwassergel) kann er Sounds im Frequenzbereich zwischen 20Hz und 20kHz wiedergeben. Dieser Lautsprecher ist aber tatsächlich nur ein Vorführprodukt, das dazu dient, den entwickelten ionischen Leiter mit seinen herausragenden Fähigkeiten zu demonstrieren. Weitere Einsatzfelder sehen die Forscher u.A. in adaptiven optischen Systeme oder auch der Robotik.</p>
<p>Ich persönlich freue mich auf künstliche Muskelstränge, mit denen ich subdermal meine Umwelt mit Dubstep erfreuen kann.</p>

<h2 id="stammzellen-forschung-jetzt-mit-weniger-petrischalen">Stammzellen-Forschung: Jetzt mit weniger Petrischalen</h2>
<p>Amerikanische Wissenschaftler haben… halt, nein, diesmal nicht. Ein Team vom Nationalen Krebsforschungszentrum (CNIO) in Madrid, Spanien, hat embryonale Stammzellen erzeugt—aus normalen Zellen eines erwachsenen Organismus (Maus), direkt im Körper, ohne Umwege über Petrischalen.</p>
<p><a href="http://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Stammzellen#Embryonale_Stammzellen_.28ES-Zellen.29">Embryonale Stammzellen</a> sind einer der Hauptpfeiler der regenerativen Medizin, da sie “Urzellen” darstellen, die vom Körper noch nicht spezialisiert worden sind. Aus ihnen können jedwede Zelltypen eines erwachsenen Organismus entstehen, um dann z.B. Autoimmunkrankheiten zu bekämpfen, beschädigte Zellen zu zu reparieren, oder neue Organe zu bilden. Allerdings ist die Gewinnung dieser Stammzellen <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stammzellen#Ethische_Kontroverse">ethisch nicht unproblematisch</a>. Seit 1981 kam hier die sog. “destruktive Embryonenforschung” zum Einsatz (ist genau das, wonach es klingt, oiy). Im Jahr 2006 entwickelten japanische Forscher dann die <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stammzellen#K.C3.BCnstlich_reprogrammierte_Stammzellen">künstliche Reprogrammierung</a> von Körperzellen erwachsener Menschen ausserhalb des Körpers, wofür sie 2012 auch den Nobelpreis für Medizin bekamen. Der Prozess ist allerdings langwierig (erwachsene Zellen werden entnommen und im Labor bearbeitet, was ca. einen Monat in Anspruch nimmt) und nur ca. 1% der behandelten Zellen werden dabei erfolgreich in Stammzellen umgewandelt.</p>
<p>Die CNIO-Studie setzt auf dieser künstlichen Reprogrammierung auf, geht aber noch einen großen Schritt weiter, da die Gewinnung/Umwandlung der Originalzellen <strong>komplett</strong> im Körper durchgeführt wird, und die gewonnenen Stammzellen vielfältiger einsetzbar sind.</p>
<p>Die spanischen Forscher denken als Ziel u.A. an lokale regenerative Behandlungen, bei denen die Zell-Regeneration direkt an den verletzten Stellen veranlasst wird. <em>“Im nächsten Schritt untersuchen wir, ob diese neuen Stammzellen imstande sind, effizient unterschiedlichen Gewebetypen zu generieren, wie z.B. Bauchspeicheldrüse, Leber oder Niere.”</em>, sagte María Abad, eine der an der Studie beteiligten Wissenschaftler.</p>
<p>Bei aller wissenschaftlichen Euphorie gibt das Team aber zu bedenken, dass praktische Anwendungen an menschlichen Patienten noch in weiter Ferne liegen. Allerdings habe ich persönlich das Gefühl, dass der Begriff <em>“in weiter Ferne</em> von Jahr zu Jahr einen kürzeren Zeitabstand umfasst. (Ich heisse das gut.)</p>
<p>Oh, und während ich mich noch über den CNIO-Durchbruch freute, kam aus Israel die Nachricht, dass <a href="http://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/stem-cell-reprogramming-made-easier">ein Forscherteam vom Weizmann Institute of Science die ursprüngliche Reprogrammierung verbessert</a> hat: durch die Entfernung eines Proteins konnten sie den Prozess von 4 Wochen auf 8 Tage beschleunigen, und die Erfolgsrate von 1% auf ca. 100% erhöhen.</p>

<h2 id="eine-gute-zeit-für-mäuseherzen">Eine gute Zeit für Mäuseherzen</h2>
<p>Aus der Rubrik <em>“Wir werden alle mindestens 200 Jahre alt”</em>:</p>
<p>Mitte August diesen Jahres haben Wissenschaftler der <a href="http://www.medschool.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine</a> ein funktionierendes Mäuseherz aus menschlichen <a href="http://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Precursorzelle">Precursor-Zellen</a> gezüchtet. Das Experiment ist ein erster Schritt dahin, funktionierende Herzen aus <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induzierte_pluripotente_Stammzelle">induzierten pluripotenten Stammzellen</a> herzustellen—für Transplationen, als Testobjekt für Medikamente und für die Herzforschung.</p>
<p>Als Ausgangspunkt für ihr Projekt diente dem Team ein Mäuseherz, dem alle Zellen entfernt wurden. Zurück blieb ein “Gerüst”, also die leere Grundstruktur des Herzens. Dieses Gerüst wurde mit sog. <em>multipotent cardiovascular progenitor (MCP)</em>-Zellen bevölkert, die zuvor aus menschlichen Hautzellen gewonnen wurden.</p>
<p>Nach einigen Wochen hatte sich das kleine Herz nicht nur aus diesen Zellen regeneriert, es begann auch mit 40-50 Schlägen pro Minute selbständig zu pumpen.</p>
<p>Bevor jetzt die Korken knallen, weil wir nun neue Herzen bei Bedarf im Labor züchten können: Die Wissenschaftler weisen darauf hin, dass mehr Arbeit und Forschung nötig ist, um das Herz komplett nachzubilden—um es stark genug zu machen, um zuverlässig Blut pumpen zu können, und um sicherzustellen, dass es korrekt auf die elektrischen Signale des Körpers reagiert.</p>
<p>Eins der nächsten Forschungsziele des Teams ist, eventuell auf einem ähnlichen Wege menschliche Herzmuskel herzustellen, um beschädigte Organe reparieren zu können.</p>

<h2 id="ich-druck-mir-eine-raumstation">Ich druck' mir eine Raumstation</h2>
<p>NASA’s <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Institute_for_Advanced_Concepts">Institute for Advanced Concepts</a> hat einen mit 500.000 USD dotierten sog. <em>Phase II</em>-Vertrag an die Firma <a href="http://www.tethers.com/">Tethers Unlimited</a> für ihr <a href="http://www.tethers.com/SpiderFab.html">Spiderfab</a>-System vergeben— <strong>einen 3D-Drucker für orbitale Konstruktionen</strong>.</p>
<p>Spiderfab ist eine Mischung aus herkömmlichem 3D-Drucker und Roboter-gestützter Montage. Der Gedanke dahinter: Rohmaterialien in Block- oder Rollenform ins All zu befördern, wo sie dann automatisiert in größere und kleinere Strukturen “gedruckt” werden. Dies wäre logistisch einfacher, als diese Konstrukte auf der Erde zu bauen, zu zerlegen, transportsicher zu verpacken und ins All zu schicken, nur um sie dort wieder zusammenzusetzen. Schliesslich macht es Sinn, Komponenten für den Einsatz in der Schwerelosigkeit—wie Antennen, Träger, Solarpanelstrukturen, etc.—direkt im Orbit herzustellen, anstatt sie wie bisher für Montage, Lagerung, Demontage und Transport für mindestens 1G auslegen zu müssen. Die Spiderfab-Technologie könnte dementsprechend vor Ort auch Konstruktionen wie z.B. Antennenreflektoren oder Solarpanele ermöglichen, die 10- bis 100-mal so groß sind wie die bisherigen Versionen.</p>
<p>Parallel zum NIAC-Vertrag entwickelt Tethers Unlimited ebenfalls für die NASA ein Gerät namens “Trusselator”, das Trägerstrukturen fabrizieren soll, die im Orbit zu großen Solar-Arrays zusammengesetzt werden. Dies soll als Ausgangspunkt für weitere Entwicklungen dienen.</p>
<p>Ich finde es toll, wenn Meldungen wie diese zwar noch nach Science Fiction klingen, es aber nicht mehr sind. Vor 10 Jahren war der Zugang zum Weltraum noch Staaten vorenthalten, nicht kommerziell arbeitenden Firmen. Ich bin gespannt, wie weit wir dann 2023 dank <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewSpace">NewSpace</a>-Pionieren wie Tethers Unlimited, SpaceX oder Bigelow Aerospace sind… \o/</p>

<h2 id="der-krieg-gegen-das-altern-hat-wahrhaftig-begonnen">Der Krieg gegen das Altern hat wahrhaftig begonnen</h2>
<p>Google-Vater <a href="https://plus.google.com/+LarryPage/posts/Lh8SKC6sED1">Larry Page hat vor wenigen Tagen die Gründung einer neue Firma namens “Calico” angekündigt</a>, deren erklärtes Ziel es ist, das menschliche Leben zu verlängern, zu verbessern und die Geheimnisse des Alterns zu entschlüsseln (und ihnen effektiv zu begegnen). Ich will nicht lügen: die Nachricht hat mir Gänsehaut gemacht—aber die gute Art.</p>
<p>Man mag von Google halten, was man will; ich weiss, wie viele meiner Mitbürger reagieren, wenn der Name “Google” fällt. ;) Aber ignorieren wir für einen Moment mal die endlosen Diskussionen um Cookies, Gmail, NSA und Streetview—ich denke, jeder wird zugeben, dass die Firma ungeschlagen darin ist, unfassbar große Datenmengen umfassend, clever und oft in überraschender Weise auszuwerten. Einige der klügsten Köpfe unserer Generationen sind dort beschäftigt; ich sage: lasst sie forschen, auswerten und an den Geheimnissen des menschlichen Körpers arbeiten! Wir können dabei nur gewinnen.</p>
<p><em>“Aber warum Google, machen die nicht nur Werbeanzeigen und Email und so?”</em> Der Konzern macht damit das Gros seiner Einnahmen, ja, aber seit ein paar Jahren stürzt er sich auch mit großer Energie und oft ebensogroßen Erfolgen auf Bereiche, die nicht soviel mit Ads und Websuche zu tun haben: er entwickelt <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_driverless_car">selbstfahrende Automobile</a> oder auch <a href="http://www.google.com/loon/">Ballon-basierte Internetknoten</a> für abgelegene Orte auf der Welt. Und ja: sicher wird Google damit auch irgendwann Geld verdienen wollen, aber damit kann ich sehr leben. Sie sind auf ein langes Spiel eingestellt, und akzeptieren, dass die ersten paar Jahre ein Verlustgeschäft sein werden; der Rest von uns bekommt neue Technologien, die großes Potential zur Disruption haben.</p>
<p>Zurück zu Calico. Der Traum, älter zu werden als frühere Generationen, er ist so alt wie die Menschheit selbst. Es gibt viele Firmen und Stiftungen, die sich seit Jahrzehnten mit dem Thema beschäftigen, aktiv Forschung betreiben und auch finanzieren. Calico ist also nicht der erste Player in diesem Bereich, wohl aber die erste mit einem derartig starken finanziellen Hintergrund—Google hat mehr Geld als Gott.</p>
<p>Dementsprechend groß war die Freude nicht nur bei mir, sondern auch bei bekannten Vertretern der Alterungsforschung: Dr. Aubrey de Grey, biomedizinischer Gerontologe und Chief Science Officer der SENS Foundation, <a href="http://ideas.time.com/2013/09/18/finally-the-war-on-aging-has-truly-begun-2/">stellte umgehend fest</a> <em>“Der Krieg gegen das Altern hat wahrhaftig begonnen”</em>.</p>

			 <p><strong>Did you know Google runs a free and open image resizing service? I certainly didn&rsquo;t.</strong></p>
<p>While lazily poking around the Google+ HTML I found an interesting thing: for resizing post images on the fly, G+ uses an open API endpoint.  That might come in handy at some point in the future when prototyping this or that, so jotting down some notes felt like a good idea.</p>
<p>If you know more about this API, let me know, please!  (See the sidebar for options.)</p>
<p>A word of warning before I progress: I&rsquo;ve spent ~45 minutes on both my experimentation and this here write-up, maybe an hour.  You&rsquo;ve been warned.</p>

It may be tempting to just ignore stupidity and ignorance coming my way, but ultimately <em>someone</em> has to pay a price, either me (by dying a little bit inside) or someone else (think customer care people having to deal with bugs/oversights in software or some such).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If gaming’s detractors say one thing, we say the opposite. Gaming causes violence? No. There is absolutely no problem with the fact that most big-budget games spill enough blood to make the Red Sea’s name literal. None whatsoever.</p>

			 <p><strong>Building a fire-and-forget ad blocker using OpenDNS.</strong></p>
<p>I am an avid Xbox Live user.  More to the point, I&rsquo;m an avid Xbox Live Gold account owner for a number of years by now.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ve paid for the console, I&rsquo;m paying for all my games, and I pay an ongoing monthly fee for the connectivity, experience, whatever you want to call it.  Still, Microsoft —proprietor of this fine service— thinks it&rsquo;s entirely sensible to put ads in the frontend, or show Kinect ads before videos.</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2020/319de036cc.jpg" alt="Screenshot dashboard ads"></p>
<p>I disagree.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://opendns.com">OpenDNS</a> to block their ad servers on my Xbox for good.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Here&rsquo;s how.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>First up: I&rsquo;m using a router, and both my Xbox and my main computer are getting their internets from it.  Since both of them go through the same router, they share the same external IP address.  If your setup is the same, this is what to do.</p>
<h3 id="what-youll-do">What you&rsquo;ll do</h3>
<p>First, you&rsquo;ll install the tiny OpenDNS client tool on your main machine so your OpenDNS account always knows about your current external IP.</p>
<p>Then, you&rsquo;ll configure your 360 to use OpenDNS' DNS server, so it&rsquo;ll adhere to your OpenDNS settings (blocked domains etc.).</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-your-mac-or-pc">Setting up your Mac or PC</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a free OpenDNS account.</li>
<li><a href="https://dashboard.opendns.com/support/">Download the OpenDNS Updater</a> for your main machine.  (There are official clients for both Windows or OS X.)</li>
<li>Go to OpenDNS&rsquo;s <a href="https://dashboard.opendns.com/settings/">settings page</a> and create and/or select your home network.</li>
<li>Install the Updater and connect it to your OpenDNS account.  Make it auto-run on startup.</li>
<li>On the settings page for that network, set your &ldquo;Web Content Filtering&rdquo; level to whatever (mine is at &ldquo;None&rdquo;), but add the following individual domains to the &ldquo;Always block&rdquo; list:<br>
· <code>g.msn.com</code><br>
· <code>rad.msn.com</code><br>
· <code>rpt.rad.msn.com</code><br>
· <code>global.msads.net</code><br>
· <code>msnvidweb.vo.msecnd.net</code></li>
</ol>
<p>At this point your OpenDNS account will a) always know your home network&rsquo;s current IP address and b) block MS' ad servers.  Your network won&rsquo;t be affected by this, tho, as it doesn&rsquo;t actively use OpenDNS.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-your-xbox-360">Setting up your Xbox 360</h3>
<ol>
<li>On your Xbox, go to the Settings page/panel → System → Configure Network.</li>
<li>Select your active network connection and go to the DNS settings.<br>
<img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2020/950befc6b5.jpg" alt="Screenshot Network Configuration"></li>
<li>Set the DNS setting to &ldquo;manual&rdquo;, then the primary DNS server to <code>208.67.222.222</code> and the secondary DNS server to <code>208.67.220.220</code>.</li>
<li>On saving these settings, your Live account will be logged out.  Just log in again.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.  Your Xbox is now using OpenDNS' DNS servers — and its blocking capabilities configured by your account; your desktop machine will auto-update your OpenDNS account with your IP address.  A perfect match.</p>
<p>If the dashboard is still showing ads, clear the 360&rsquo;s cache or wait a day or two for the ads to expire.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: works for me, YMMV, I take no responsibility.  Moo.</p>

			 <p><strong>It&rsquo;s the godsdamn console wars all over again, I swear.</strong></p>
<p>So today Apple might/will/should announce the iPhone 5.  Which, of course, means there&rsquo;ll be a <em>hilarious avalanche</em> of delightful &ldquo;art&rdquo; by curiously insecure<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Android users, just like <a href="https://plus.google.com/110255737428907780217/posts">this one</a>:</p>

<p>Haha, it&rsquo;s funny because it&rsquo;s <em>utter bullshit</em>.</p>
<p>I guess Apple users are from Mars, Android users are from Venus!!!1  Or something.  Bloody hell, I&rsquo;m already sick and tired of the predictable Apple user bashing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that many conscious Android users I&rsquo;ve met don&rsquo;t understand what I like about iOS, it&rsquo;s that they <em>don&rsquo;t want</em> to hear why.  Not all of them, mind.  Just …many.  You prefer Android?  Great, your choice, have fun.  Me, I like iOS better.  That doesn&rsquo;t make me retarded or a sheep or a mindless drone.</p>
<p>But your willful ignoring <em>my</em> reasons, preferences and ability to decide make <em>you</em> look like a proper fuckstick.  The door swings both ways, of course: rabid iOS fans are no better.</p>
<p>And when I talk with those people, it becomes clear that their minds are so set on &ldquo;the one true OS/device/whatever&rdquo; that they&rsquo;re convinced the other side has nothing new or better to offer.  Also, that the other side is nothing but braindead drones following a cult.  But that is a ridiculous notion, especially when talking about iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Different people look for different things: favourite screen sizes, how multitasking is handled, whether or not there should be hardware buttons, how configurable everything is etc.  And that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s supposed to be.  Just remember that maxing out, rooting or skinning your Android handset won&rsquo;t make you Neo; much like how meticulously re-ordering the icons on your iPhone doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the goddamn Batman<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Jony Ive.</p>
<p><em>You&rsquo;ve made a hardware/software choice.</em>  Congratulations.  My guess is it was the right one for you.  Now live with it, own it.  And please understand that your choice won&rsquo;t improve retroactively by belittling others.  The other party is not at fault, so suck it up, you pussies.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t grok that: Go die in a fire, you righteous cunts.</p>

			 <p><strong>The Saga continues, or: Goodbye Calepin, hello Jekyll.</strong></p>
<p>A few weeks ago <a href="/2012/04/21/post-it-29/" title="Post-It #29">word got around</a> that Calepin, the Dropbox-based blog service I used, was going to close soon.</p>
<p>Luckily, all my posts were plain text files on my Mac already (well, Markdown files), so I was much calmer this time around as I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t mean as <a href="/2012/01/20/the-big-blog-move-of-2012/" title="The big blog move of 2012 (part 1)">much work as last time</a>.</p>
<p>Still, it meant I&rsquo;d have to move yet <em>again</em>, and after looking around without finding anything that suited me<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I hunkered down and tried to come up with a setup that wouldn&rsquo;t annoy me (much).  After a few minutes I decided to go with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a>, <em>&ldquo;a simple, blog aware, static site generator&rdquo;</em>, as the site says.  Eats Markdown files, poops out static HTML pages, works for me.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Of course, moving from a site like Calepin means having to start over with the entire design; back when I moved to Calepin I had felt happy about not having to make any design choices, and I was fond of its minimalist approach &ndash; no fluff, just text, I liked that.  I would stick with that idea.</p>
<p>As I am lacking any skill when it comes to original design I tried to find out what I liked about the look of some other blogs I read.  <strong>So I drew a good amount of inspiration from these sites and apps</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dcurt.is">Dustin Curtis</a>: I really liked the rather minimalist, fixed left column.</li>
<li>Both <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/iphone">Instapaper&rsquo;s iOS app</a> &amp; <a href="http://dcurt.is">Dustin Curtis</a> (again) made me realize I love <a href="http://fontdeck.com/font/proximanova/regular">Proxima Nova</a> &ndash; what a beautiful font.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.robinsloan.com/about/">Robin Sloan</a>: It was his site where I found my headline font, <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/le-monde-courrier-std">Le Monde Courrier STD</a>.  Also, I like the highlighting he is using in some of his posts, as well as the formatting of the post dates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, guys!  :)</p>
<p>Then I came across <a href="http://informationarchitects.net/blog/sweep-the-sleaze/">Oliver Reichenstein&rsquo;s rather good iA post, &ldquo;Sweep the Sleaze&rdquo;</a>, which made me think about all those damn social buttons.  Initially I had considered adding some bare-bones sharing mechanisms to the site, but that article gave me pause.  Those things are everywhere, but how often had I actually used them?  Not very often &ndash; my Twitter client is open anyways, and I guess yours is, too.  So <em>if</em> you want to share something you read here<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, you&rsquo;d probably know how to do it anyways, and very likely have your favourite tools at hand, to boot.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rule of thumb: If you can&rsquo;t be bothered to copy and paste a link, chances are high it&rsquo;s not that important/hilarious/awe-inspiring anyways.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  And frankly, not <em>everything</em> I say or write will make you want to wring your hat in your hands, gasping with amazement.  Yes, yes, no, don&rsquo;t say it &ndash; I know it&rsquo;s true.  So there.</p>
<p>Also, after taking a peek at my logs I noticed almost no visitor cared about my tag pages or categories, so I did away with those as well.  Thus, there&rsquo;s only post pages like this one and <a href="/">overview pages</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of CSS</strong>, I&rsquo;ve decided to use <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> as the foundation, which is a minimal set of CSS rules for <strong>responsive design</strong> &ndash; meaning the site will look good on a big desktop monitor as well as on an iPhone screen.</p>
<p>HTML-wise, I looted some ideas from my friend Mike&rsquo;s site, among them his rather clever use of microformats &ndash; the <code>address</code> tag implementation on <a href="http://mikewest.org">mikewest.org</a> made me nod very, very approvingly.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  Thanks, Mike!</p>
<p><strong>The fonts are served by Typekit and Fontdeck.</strong>  Why not just one of them?  Well, funny story.  I signed up for Typekit&rsquo;s $25/yr <a href="https://typekit.com/plans">&ldquo;Personal Plan&rdquo;</a> &ndash; and only then I realized my beloved Proxima Nova wasn&rsquo;t available in that plan.  Of course, upgrading to the $50/yr &ldquo;Portfolio Plan&rdquo; would give me access, but well, fuck that.  <a href="http://fontdeck.com/">Fontdeck</a>&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo;</em> idea made more sense in that situation, as I could purchase/rent Proxima Nova for a mere $10/yr.  So that&rsquo;s what I did.  Of course Fontdeck doesn&rsquo;t offer the Le Monde fonts, so that&rsquo;s where Typekit comes in.  It&rsquo;s all a bit weird, really.</p>
<p><strong>To the server, then!</strong>  Ah yes, but a few weeks ago I had cancelled pretty much all my old personal server hosting, and hadn&rsquo;t gotten around to look for a new one.  But you know who&rsquo;s good at hosting?  <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>!  <a href="http://www.heroku.com/pricing">Their pricing</a> starts at &ldquo;free&rdquo;, and I figured said free level would have plenty juice to serve a static site.  <a href="https://gist.github.com/15666dac3cf4b5b2f8c4">16 lines of code later</a> I knew I was right.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s working, and I&rsquo;m reasonably proud of my wee blog.  I still want something Dropbox-based, and in a way, I already have parts of it.  My &ldquo;raw&rdquo; post files reside in a Dropbox folder, but to publish them I have to hit the terminal, which is a bit of a downer.  There&rsquo;s a high chance I might end up doing something about this at some point in the future.  We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>But maybe I&rsquo;ll write some blog posts first.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://zottmann.org/2012/05/21/020000.html">Hazel Quick Tip: Automatically extract the actual installer from Adobe&#39;s Flash Player installer</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><strong>Yo dawg I herd you like installers so we put an installer inside your installer so you can install while you install.</strong></p>
<p>Oh hey, there&rsquo;s <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">a new Adobe Flash Player release</a> for Mac.  Wonderful.  Naturally, the download package is a DMG file (a disk image); you double-click it after downloading, that&rsquo;ll mount a new &ldquo;drive&rdquo;, and there&rsquo;s the installer app.  Unfortunately, the suave bastards at Adobe&rsquo;s Mac division are too cool for school, so the installer app is not just a plain old Mac installer app, no siree.  They wrote their own fat installer, which during the install process <em>insists</em> on you closing all your browsers <em>OR ELSE</em>.</p>
<p>A bit annoying, that.</p>
<p>But luckily, their own fat installer is basically just a bunch of fluff/clutter/bullshit around the <em>actual</em> 0ld sk00l installer.  So, one could theoretically right-click the <code>Install Adobe Flash Player.app</code> after mounting the DMG, pick &ldquo;Show Package Contents&rdquo;, and poke around to find the real installer, the one that doesn&rsquo;t annoy as much by not forcing you to close your browsers right away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this twice in the past, manually.  Well, a new Flash Player release is out, so let&rsquo;s automate this once and for all.</p>
<p>My weapon of choice in this case is the <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel">highly useful Hazel</a>.  It&rsquo;s great for folder-based automation — it slices, it dices (…and I don&rsquo;t get a kickback).</p>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s what this new Hazel rule should do when I mount the download package <code>install_flash_player_osx.dmg</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the actual installer (<code>Adobe Flash Player.pkg</code>) from inside the <code>Install Adobe Flash Player.app</code> to my <code>~/Downloads</code> folder.</li>
<li>Unmount the disk image.</li>
</ol>
<p>Easy!</p>
<p>Step 1: in Hazel&rsquo;s preference pane, link a new folder — &ldquo;Volumes&rdquo;:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the &ldquo;+&rdquo; icon in the lower left corner.</li>
<li>In the Finder selection window navigate to your &ldquo;Macintosh HD&rdquo; root (in the sidebar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Devices&rdquo; section); it should contain a few folders, among them &ldquo;Applications&rdquo;, &ldquo;System&rdquo;, &ldquo;Users&rdquo;.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s likely you won&rsquo;t see &ldquo;Volumes&rdquo; because that folder is usually hidden.  We need to make it temporarily visible now.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re moving dangerously close to <em>Matrix</em> territory here, but stay calm, you&rsquo;ve trained for this!  Press <code>Shift+Cmd+.</code> (period).  That&rsquo;ll make all the folder contents visible.</li>
<li>Find &ldquo;Volumes&rdquo;, click it, then hit the &ldquo;Open&rdquo; button in the lower right corner.</li>
</ol>
<p>That was the first step: Hazel should now show &ldquo;Volumes&rdquo; in the left-hand side &ldquo;Folders&rdquo; list, which means she&rsquo;s ready for you to add rules for that folder.  Fortunately, we only need one rule here.</p>
<p>Step 2: Add that one rule.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the &ldquo;+&rdquo; button in Hazel&rsquo;s right-hand side &ldquo;Rules&rdquo; section.</li>
<li>A new rules panel will appear.</li>
<li>Enter something meaningful in the &ldquo;Name&rdquo; field, ex. <em>&ldquo;Flash Player: Copy actual installer to ~/Downloads and unmount&rdquo;</em>.</li>
<li>In the second section, add a new condition for the file or folder being matched: (Name) (Is) (Flash Player).</li>
<li>In the third section, add the action: (Run shell script) (embedded script).  Click &ldquo;Edit script&rdquo; and paste the following code:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>cp -r /Volumes/Flash\ Player/Install\ Adobe\ Flash\ Player.app/Contents/Resources/Adobe\ Flash\ Player.pkg ~/Downloads/ &amp;&amp; osascript -e &quot;tell application \&quot;Finder\&quot; to eject \&quot;Flash Player\&quot;&quot;</code></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what it should look like:</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2012-05-21-hazel-quick-tip-extract-flash-player-installer.png" alt="Screenshot"></p>
<p>If it does, click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;.  You&rsquo;re done!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.  Try it out, go download <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">Flash Player for Mac</a> and double-click it (<code>install_flash_player_osx.dmg</code>).  Hazel should do her fine work, and a few seconds later you should find the real installer —<code>Adobe Flash Player.pkg</code>— in your <code>Downloads</code> folder.  And she&rsquo;ll do that for every new release you download.  Just double-click it and sit tight.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel">Hazel</a>.  Helluva girl…  helluva girl.</p>

			 <p><strong>Dev HTTP Client, Calepin closing, Facebook dick move #2754, shoelace knots, dubstep agriculture.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bloody useful.</strong>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aejoelaoggembcahagimdiliamlcdmfm">Dev HTTP Client</a> is a Google Chrome extension to <em>&quot;[e]asily construct custom HTTP requests, save them permanently, take advantage of variables and contexts.&quot;</em>  Comes with lots of neat features such as response syntax highlighting (HTML/XML/JSON) and image previews.</p>
<p><strong>Calepin is closing shop.</strong>  The blogging service I use for this here blog is called <a href="http://calepin.co/">Calepin</a>, and I like it a lot (as <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/2012/01/20/the-big-blog-move-of-2012/">mentioned before</a>).  Unfortunately, Jökull can no longer maintain it and so decided <a href="http://twitter.com/calepinapp/status/192335906479415296">to close shop in June</a>.  He <a href="http://github.com/jokull/calepin">open-sourced the project</a>, tho.  If anyone wants to pick it up…</p>
<p>Being no stranger to the blogging game, I know all of my options, but I gotta say, Calepin&rsquo;s concept (single files in Dropbox + push-button publishing via the website) really appealed to me more than the everything-in-Github-and-publish-via-Terminal way.  I&rsquo;d switch to Calepin-contender <a href="http://scriptogr.am/">Scriptogram</a> in an instant if they would allow for more flexibility in their blogs' URL paths.</p>
<p><strong>Better not use the word &ldquo;book&rdquo; there, pal.</strong>  In the name of your new project, and if you&rsquo;re a Facebook user, that is.  As <a href="http://j.mp/I0Skpr">Ars reported a month ago</a>, if you&rsquo;re a FB user, you&rsquo;ve agreed on a legally binding contract that prevents you from using several words in your own, non-FB projects.  Nice to see they&rsquo;re staying in character.</p>
<p><strong>Fukken shoelaces, how do they work?</strong>  There&rsquo;s more than one way to tie a knot.  I own some shoelaces that come undone rather easily (due to their teflon-like surface material), but tying them using the <a href="http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknot.htm">Ian Knot</a> helps.</p>
<p><strong>Hardcore l33t farming.</strong>  Today&rsquo;s extreme e-sports video (spoof) is delightful.</p>

			 <p><strong>How to get super-ripped without leaving your chair.</strong></p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I&rsquo;m doing table push-ups in my coffee breaks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned <a href="http://twitter.com/municode">on Twitter</a> the other day that a few weeks ago I&rsquo;ve started a rather casual office fitness routine.  Some people were actually asking about it, so I think a quick blog post is in order.</p>
<p>First up: what I describe here <em>works for me</em>.  YMMV.  Okay?  Cool.</p>
<p>Basically, my day job is to sit on my ass all day long, hunched over a laptop, typing like a rabid monkey.  Occasionally I will lean back in my chair, stroking my chin approvingly/disdainfully while nodding either smugly/Blofeld&rsquo;ish.  Sounds familiar?</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s usually good work, it&rsquo;s bad for my posture.  My neck and shoulders were cramping up every now and then, and my manly torso muscles started camouflaging themselves with flabber.</p>
<p>So I started taking short 2-minute breaks every 30-45 minutes.  I just get up from my desk and walk around.  (There are apps that will remind you to do that; I went with <a href="http://breaktimeapp.com/">Breaktime</a>.)  Standing up and getting my blood circulation going again is good, and it helps me thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Now for the good part.</strong>  To soften up my shoulders and neck again, <strong>I started doing table push-ups</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.  At first I was doing 10 per break, which was easy.  A few days later, it felt silly, and I doubled that.  Still easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been almost 2 months since I started.  By now <strong>I&rsquo;m doing 250-300 push-ups every other day</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.  And yes, I&rsquo;m doing it in the office.  Since I&rsquo;m neither huffing nor puffing nor breaking a sweat, I guess it&rsquo;s cool for everyone involved and/or around me.  No complaints so far.  ;)</p>
<p>Those numbers might not sound much (or way too much, depending on where you&rsquo;re coming from), but hey.  Slow and steady wins the race, and I&rsquo;m really not in a hurry.  It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m trying to do them all at once.  (I couldn&rsquo;t.)</p>
<p>And so, 8 weeks in, my shoulders and neck are much, much better than before.  Also, I&rsquo;ve lost some body fat and gained some muscle tissue.  Again, no complains; my wife seems to approve, that counts for something.  Sure, I could visit a gym and see a better outcome, but gyms are not for me, really.  I&rsquo;m a very important biznis person, I have no time for this shit.</p>
<p>So, yeah, good old-fashioned table push-ups.  It&rsquo;s a casual yet pragmatic approach to getting back into shape, and it actually does make me feel better.  I won&rsquo;t claim I invented it, but it works for me.</p>

			 <p><strong>Great game, great series, no happy endings, many people outraged.</strong></p>
<p><strong>MASS EFFECT SPOILERS AHEAD, YOU&rsquo;VE BEEN WARNED.</strong></p>
<p>Last night I finished the Mass Effect 3, the last part of an exceptional scifi trilogy.  Up until this point I&rsquo;ve consciously evaded all ME3 news, posts, reviews, articles, videos etc. that were floating around.  I knew there was some sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_3#Controversy">controversy regarding the game&rsquo;s ending</a>, but I had successfully tuned out all that hubbub whenever it came up.</p>
<p>But now that I&rsquo;m done fighting the good fight, I took a look — and boy, the outrage!  So many angry people shaking their fists at Bioware HQ, it&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2012-04-me3.jpeg" alt="Shepard standing in front of Earth"></p>
<p>Problem is: I&rsquo;ve no idea what those people are complaining about, and when skimming the forums the overall mood seems to be that if you like that ending, you might be on weed.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s why I loved the game, and yes, its ending, too.  Especially the ending, actually.</p>
<p>The emotional punches the game threw really struck me; it&rsquo;s probably due to me being so heavily invested in the first two games as well.  The underlying pressure it dishes out in every briefing, the omnipresent feeling of a galaxy at war, of everything being at stake, the loss of Mordin and Legion, the reminiscing with Garrus, later on saying my good-byes to everyone, Liara&rsquo;s gift, Anderson…  all of that hit home, brutally so, again and again.  And the ending (I went with the 3rd option) just fit the overall narrative arc and personality of my Shepard.</p>
<p>I seldom come across works of art that make me feel that heavy, that weary, that elated, and that misty-eyed, but when I do, I tend revel in those moments.  Beauty doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean constant happiness.</p>
<p>Thus, I really wonder what people were expecting… a movie blockbuster finish á la ID4, maybe.  I don&rsquo;t know.  Many people didn&rsquo;t like it, then.  I can respect that, as it&rsquo;s definitely not a happy ending.  But <em>people are seriously demanding</em> Bioware has to change the artistic vision of their work?  Give me a fucking break.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>So, why didn&rsquo;t I complain?  Why wasn&rsquo;t I bothered by the supposedly botched finish?</p>
<p>For starters, I was aware that I was working and acting within the confines of a big, pre-written narrative arc, and so the choices offered were not that …offensive.  I was given the choice between pest, cholera and a (to me) rather acceptable compromise.</p>
<p>Just like &ldquo;my&rdquo; Shepard I, too, was kind of surprised we got that far, and so I took what I could get.  I mean, Shepard wasn&rsquo;t able to simply will the Reapers away, so he/I was accepting the cards given and going with what he/I had.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t understand the outrage.  See, at the end of ME1, Sovereign was beaten, yet still most people (in ME&rsquo;s universe) were trying very hard to believe that one single Reaper was just a fluke.  And I, the player, had no choice about making them <em>really</em> believe.  Still, it was very clear Sovereign was just a hint of things to come.  Among the players, noone was angry about that fact, because it was a major point in the story we were participating in.</p>
<p>Then, at the end of ME2, you could either keep the collector base or blow it up; but to get there, your ship had to be configured just right, there was no player decision involved.  To effectively start the suicide mission, the Normandy <em>had</em> to be ready.  Didn&rsquo;t install that Thanix cannon?  Your assault would fail before reaching that base.  Outside the game, noone was outraged about that.  And whether the base remained or not, it was still clear the Reapers would show up in force, and soon.  Stopping the Collectors didn&rsquo;t change that, and noone was outraged, because it was another major story point.</p>
<p>At the beginning of ME3, Earth got hit.  You were tasked with assembling the biggest strike force possible to hit back, knowing the resulting mother of all battles would conclude the story.  Near the end, when the battle was in full swing, Shepard went into the lion&rsquo;s den, and it was clear for a long time coming s/he wouldn&rsquo;t come out again.  And again, in said den, you&rsquo;d only have so many options; your cards would be dealed, and you had to decide what to do with your understandably bad deck.</p>
<p>Cue the outrage.</p>
<p>I think my point is this: I was part of an epic story, and was allowed to work within its framework, and I am happy I did.  But just like life, in the Mass Effect universe there are so many things that I <em>can&rsquo;t</em> change, things happening by chance and outside influences, and I like it for that, as it was playing make-believe, but in a rather, well, <em>realistic</em> way.</p>
<p>People around me were dying over the course of the entire game, hard choices had to be made, this oppressive feeling of doom was <em>really</em> affecting my mood, and for that wide range of emotions evoked over the course of those 40 hours I am actually thankful.  (Not because my life is dull and I need the change, but because I like my scifi stories un-bland and gripping, mind.)</p>
<p>So I wasn&rsquo;t surprised to see its bleak endings; maybe their visual representation could&rsquo;ve shown a bit more variety than different color palettes, yes.  Regardless, to me the marks they would make on that universe, their outcomes, were perfectly aligned with the rest of the storytelling, its tone, its philosophical questions.  What is life?  What does it mean to be alive?  What would you sacrifice, how far would you go to achieve your goals?  Is it all worth it?</p>
<p>I stood there for a minute, considering my choices.  I looked up, seeing the silent explosions around Earth, and I felt a slight terror inside, because I considered all those thousands of (make-believe) people dying in those (make-believe) explosions while I was thinking furiously, trying to make the best of an impossible situation.</p>
<p>What could I do, then?  Destroy all synthetics?  But I had just helped the Geth going their next step as a species, and what about EDI?!  I couldn&rsquo;t possibly erase an entire people!  But taking control of the old machines felt very wrong, too.  So…  Synthesis, then?  Considering that all the races had just come together to fight an overwhelming threat side by side, putting aside their differences, organics and synthetics alike, it struck me that we were already on the right track as species, and that this was just another compromise, a rather small step, if it meant saving all those people.  So that&rsquo;s what I did, making Shepard run towards the beam, throwing away his gun and taking a leap of faith.</p>
<p>Sometimes bad shit happens to good people.  And frankly, to Shepard and his crew(s), <em>a lot</em> of bad shit had already happened, and not all of them did walk away from it.  (Here&rsquo;s to our fallen.)  From that first recon drop on Eden Prime, all those twisted paths we took to get to the top of that Crucible went downhill.</p>
<p>The overall picture painted in the Mass Effect games was a rather bleak one, right from the beginning — and in that context, the endings fit right in.</p>
<p>And honestly, I&rsquo;m rather thankful for that.  It was an amazing <em>tour de force</em>, and I don&rsquo;t want to miss an hour of it.  In my opinion, it was a good, sad, bold and worthy ending to a excitingly good scifi series, and I&rsquo;d rather have that than an <a href="http://chainsawsuit.com/tag/action-champ-walkaway/">action champ walkaway</a> one.</p>
<p>Thanks, Bioware.</p>

<p><strong>Get it out there.</strong>  I fell in love with <a href="http://progrium.com/localtunnel/">localtunnel</a> this week: <em>&ldquo;The easiest way to share localhost web servers to the rest of the world&rdquo;</em>.  Let&rsquo;s say you want to temporarily share your local dev server (running on port 3000) with the outside world, i.e. a client or a colleague.  Run the server as usual, then do a <code>gem install localtunnel &amp;&amp; localtunnel 3000</code>.  Boom, done.  Your local server will be available on the URL the gem will output (<code>http://xyz.localtunnel.com</code>).  It&rsquo;s similar to <a href="http://showoff.io">showoff.io</a> but it&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p><strong>Blast from the past.</strong>  <a href="http://www.baldursgate.com/news/2012/03/21/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition-for-ipad-3/">Baldur&rsquo;s Gate for iPad was announced.</a>  Yes!</p>
<p><strong>Mail on iPhone.</strong>  <a href="http://sparrowapp.com/iphone.php">Sparrow for iPhone</a> is a thing of beauty.  The current v1.0 doesn&rsquo;t have push, but I can very well live with that.  Now if there only was a way to make Sparrow the default mail client…</p>
<p>On a related note, I&rsquo;m not a big mail-on-handheld nut, i.e. I actively try to avoid doing mail on my phone as much as possible, for the same reason I try to avoid playing games on it — my brain needs some downtime every now and then, and generating input everytime I wait in line for a minute is preventing it from generating any output.  It&rsquo;s unable to create while consuming.</p>
<p><strong>Lost in Space</strong>.  Fascinating stories from the early Russian space program, uncovered by <a href="http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/1302/lost_in_space.html">two Italian youngsters in the mid 1950-1960s using their self-made radio equipment</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Dow Jones is fukken broken.</strong>  The New York Times asks, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/magazine/dow-jones-problems.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=all">&ldquo;Why Do We Still Care About the Dow?&quot;</a>  As someone who isn&rsquo;t a finance worker person, I have to say the article makes a compelling case against keeping the Dow Jones around.</p>
<p><strong>RUIN.</strong>  Last but not least: a 8-min CGI short movie for your enjoyment.</p>

			 <p><strong>I&rsquo;m not strong enough to stomach this.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workout-hero-wod-fitness-log/id447619364?mt=8">Workout Hero for iPhone</a> ($1.99 at the time of writing) is a CrossFit app which <em>&ldquo;provides you with all the tools to become a Workout Hero&rdquo;</em>.  I bought it because I was under the impression I could use it to keep track of my casual push-up regimen, and other types of workout I might eventually decide <!-- raw HTML omitted -->against<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on doing.  Turns out I can do that, I just don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>It is a a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossfit">crossfit</a> app, meaning it&rsquo;s targetted not at counting single push-ups but crossfit workouts.  Since push-ups can be part of those, I figured I&rsquo;ll give it a spin.  It has an average of 4.5 stars in the App Store (over 400 ratings at the time of this writing), so it clearly has found its fan base.  Its feature list is longer than my leg; the app has a lot of features and workout suggestions and whatnot.  Its store description clearly doesn&rsquo;t lie about that.</p>
<p>What it fails to mention is the utterly horrible user interface.   It&rsquo;s like staring into an abyss, and the abyss saying <em>&ldquo;LOL bro&rdquo;</em>.  Entering workouts is a pain, I can&rsquo;t put it any other way.  There&rsquo;s a dedicated settings page in the iOS settings app that doesn&rsquo;t do anything but show text saying <em>&ldquo;Cool things might go here one day ;)&quot;</em>.  I mean, seriously. The black intro screen is used as background almost everywhere, and while I could tolerate that even though it&rsquo;s not my fancy, the forms are just plain broken in the way they work — with sometimes missing cursor indicators, and prefilled &ldquo;placeholder&rdquo; text you actually have to <em>delete every single time</em> you want to enter a new workout title.  Good stuff.</p>
<p>While $1.99/€1.59 is an acceptable price for an app, I was hoping for something that didn&rsquo;t feel as cobbled together as Workout Hero.  Buying that app was a bad decision.</p>
<p>So, my search continues.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE, June 8th 2012:</strong>  Added clarification regarding the app&rsquo;s target demographic after an email exchange with its author.</p>

			 <p><strong>If you think sexual harassment is acceptable, you&rsquo;re a goddamn idiot.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-03-03-its-time-to-kick-back-against-gaming-bigots">What the fuck is wrong with that guy?</a></p>
<p>Quick recap: a few days ago, Capcom held a Street Fighter X Tekken tournament.  It was televised, and showed some of the seedy underbelly of the videogaming community.  There was misogyny, talk of rape, and the declaration that this was entirely acceptable as Street Fighter and sexual harassment are one and the same thing.  Mindblowing.</p>
<p>But, well, it might be a good thing that Capcom thing exploded like it did.  This filth needs to be dragged into the light.  I have no issues with friendly smack talk between contenders — as long as it&rsquo;s funny to everyone involved.  But that requires some empathy and a feel for the room, so to speak; two traits that  Aris guy seem to lack.  Telling a female player, nay, anyone, <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna rape you, bitch&rdquo;</em> is unacceptable in any given case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that if you <em>really</em> want to have your heritage, sexuality and race questioned, the fastest way to do that is to just jump into any competitive public online game on Xbox Live.  That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I seldom play online with strangers, and when I do, why I have the voices muted when playing.  But yes, that&rsquo;s akin to looking the other way.  But I&rsquo;ve used both the XBL report and rate features a few times to complain about some fucknuggets hurtling <em>vile</em> insults in my direction just because I managed to hit them in a Halo match.  It&rsquo;s not much, and I really don&rsquo;t know whether anything of that made a difference, but not doing anything would&rsquo;ve been even less of an act.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I&rsquo;ve lost all interest in just checking out public/open games on XBL because of that.  And I am a male, white, heterosexual, mid-30s guy who&rsquo;s so far been treated well by the universe.  I&rsquo;m a large, semi-muscular man, I can take it — but as it turns out, I really don&rsquo;t want to anymore.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to read more about these utterly sorry events, <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/news/when-passions-flare-lines-are-crossed-updated/4006/">GiantBomb&rsquo;s coverage is good</a>.  Still: what a depressing topic.</p>

<p><strong>Sublime Text 2 has quickly become my default text editor</strong>, and it&rsquo;s great that you can enhance it with some select packages.  My favourites so far are <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control">Sublime Package Control</a> (great starting point!), <a href="https://github.com/uipoet/sublime-jshint">sublime-jshint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/condemil/Gist">Gist</a> and <a href="https://github.com/titoBouzout/SideBarEnhancements">SideBarEnhancements</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Allrounder devices FTW!</strong>  TechBlock&rsquo;s editorial <a href="http://www.thetechblock.com/articles/2012/samsungs-super-sized-galaxy-note-changed-my-life/">&ldquo;Samsung’s super-sized Galaxy Note changed my life&rdquo;</a> is rather in-depth.  Beautiful photography, too.</p>
<p><strong>Gumroad is really, really, really simple way to sell links.</strong>  As in: you have something you want to sell (link/picture/file), you want to accept credit cards, and you want to get it done in under 10 minutes.  (Like, oh I don&rsquo;t know, <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/DBDe">a picture of me saluting you.</a>)  Its simplicity is great but due to the absence of an API there&rsquo;s no way to create links programmatically.  Still: selling something won&rsquo;t get much simpler than this.</p>
<p><strong>Coffee is helping.</strong>  Mackenzie Sheppard&rsquo;s short documentary <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/video/print/2012/02/one-mans-quest-to-bring-good-coffee-and-hope-to-japans-tsunami-zone/252592/">Yoshi&rsquo;s Blend</a> is really touching.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the earthquake and tsunami, Yoshi Masuda set out to share his love of coffee and vintage gramophone tunes with survivors, driving across Japan in a VW bus and setting up outposts of the HOPE Cafe. His humble goal is to create a scene of normalcy and warmth in a devastated area.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just over 8 minutes long, so take a quick break and go for it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><strong>Goodbye, Tumblr!  Hello, Calepin!</strong></p>
<p>So, once again I was fed up with my choice of blogging platform.   Tumblr, <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/2009/10/14/the-big-blog-move-of-2009">which I had turned to</a> after ditching Wordpress, is just not what I am looking for anymore.  It&rsquo;s not a bad platform in itself, but I noticed more and more that…</p>
<ol>
<li>I really don&rsquo;t care about &ldquo;liking&rdquo; a post (I am talking about Tumblr&rsquo;s own feature, not Facebook&rsquo;s.)</li>
<li>I really don&rsquo;t like reblogging all that much.  It&rsquo;s great for quickfire, semi-mindless sharing of other people&rsquo;s content, but I try to get away from that myself, so there.</li>
<li>The lack of a meaningful export is annoying.  To be honest, it vexes me that several years after its launch, Tumblr still has no real, official, <em>right</em> way of exporting my posts.  Yes, I know the <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/goodies">semi-official Mac app</a> written by an (ex?) employee a few years ago, but here&rsquo;s the thing: I wrote all my posts in Markdown, yet the only format the export yields is rendered HTML pages.  (Find the error.)  Yes, I could&rsquo;ve/should&rsquo;ve made copies of the Markdown posts in the first place, before submitting them to Tumblr.  But that only brings me to my next point:</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t really feel like composing blog posts in a browser window anymore, so for the last few posts I ended up writing them in a desktop editor, then copying them over to Tumblr&rsquo;s web interface.  Now when you want to make a change, what is the source of truth?  Why not just skip a step?</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result, I wrote less and less.</p>
<p>The older I get the more I realize I really want to own my (relevant) content.  As an example, should Tumblr go belly-up tomorrow, all my precious blog posts would be gone, and I won&rsquo;t have that.  While I could make regular backups, it&rsquo;s impractical and prone to negligence; due to the way things are, &ldquo;make a Tumblr backup&rdquo; is equivalent to <em>&ldquo;set a recurring reminder, then open the app, click a number of buttons, and hope the API isn&rsquo;t overwhelmed right now&rdquo;</em>.  This doesn&rsquo;t fly.</p>
<p>Thus, I ended up doing a final export, then writing a custom script utilizing <a href="https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text">html2text</a> which converted the HTML output back to Markdown (while mangling all footnotes — that was fun).  Once I was done with this I knew I can never go back to Tumblr.</p>
<p>In any case, I believe by now it&rsquo;s clear where I am going with this.</p>
<h3 id="tally">Tally</h3>
<p>So where does that leave me?  What do I want from a blogging service/engine?</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to own my content, meaning I want to have the original files around even when the service/engine doesn&rsquo;t work.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t want to have to copy and paste posts into a form in a browser window.  The files on my machine(s) should be the source of truth.</li>
<li>I want native Markdown support.  &lsquo;nuff said.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking all these things into account, it didn&rsquo;t take me long to realize a solution based around (git-)based static file generators might be what I was looking for.  So I started testing out <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> and several other tools alike.  Good stuff — I like the idea, yet I noticed I really don&rsquo;t want to be bothered with git or other command-line tools when I feel like writing.  (It&rsquo;s a matter of taste, I guess.)</p>
<h3 id="the-new-kid">The new kid</h3>
<p>Then a few weeks ago I came across <a href="http://calepin.co/">Calepin</a>.  It&rsquo;s a rather opinionated Dropbox-based service.  It&rsquo;ll pick up <code>.md</code>/<code>.rst</code> files in your <code>~/Dropbox/Apps/Calepin/</code> folder, generate a static site and serve that for you from its server (<strong>not</strong> from your Dropbox).</p>
<p>It is opinionated insofar that it assumes you want to use Markdown, might want to point your readers to your Twitter account, might want to use <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> for comments, and might want to use a custom domain name, while being somewhat desinterested in customizing your blog any further.  Which is okay for me, but I&rsquo;m sure it isn&rsquo;t for everyone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some bare-bones site configuration available in the form of a <code>settings.json</code> file in the same folder — this is how you tell Calepin which Google Analytics ID or Disqus profile to use, for example.</p>
<p>When registering and setting up your blog on the site, you can also specify a custom domain to be used (CNAME).</p>
<p>Pictures and other assets can/should be served from your <code>~/Dropbox/Public/</code> folder.  Clever idea.</p>
<p>The per-post metadata is something very much like <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/yaml-front-matter">YAML front matter</a> and can be used to set title, abstract, status, date, slug, category and/or tags.  If you set the <code>Status: draft</code> directive in a post file, the post isn&rsquo;t published.  The slug may contain folder names — for example, <code>Slug: 2012/01/20/zomg</code> will result in the URL <code>[username].calepin.co/2012/01/20/zomg/</code>.  I like that.</p>
<p>The publish process is triggered by clicking the aptly named &ldquo;Publish&rdquo; button on calepin.co.</p>
<h3 id="but">But…</h3>
<p>Calepin is not themeable.  It also lacks support for extra header/footer links, &ldquo;special&rdquo; pages, widgets or doodads (yet?).  For me, that&rsquo;s not a problem (yet?), tho, since I noticed I can get clever using a page&rsquo;s <code>Slug</code> directive.</p>
<p>(For example, I wanted a &ldquo;Me&rdquo; page: I created a file <code>me.md</code>, then set its slug to &ldquo;me&rdquo; and its post date in the future (so the page will stay at the top of the front page).  For the time being, this works well enough for me.  YMMV.)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no timezone support yet, at this point all timestamps are UTC.</p>
<h3 id="the-future">The future</h3>
<p>Calepin&rsquo;s creator, <a href="http://jokull.calepin.co/">Jökull Sólberg Auðunsson</a>, made some statements regarding future features etc. in the comments to the <a href="http://jokull.calepin.co/calepin-guide.html">Calepin Guide</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>There might be additional customization options like footer sections or subpages.</li>
<li>A command-line tool is &ldquo;coming soon&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Calepin might transform into a freemium/premium service at some point.  It&rsquo;ll be interesting to follow that development.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="and-finally">And finally…</h3>
<p>My new/old/moved blog is back at <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/">carlo.zottmann.org</a>.  This is where it resided back in its Wordpress days (self-hosted), its Tumblr incarnation was located at <a href="http://blog.zottmann.org/">blog.zottmann.org</a>.</p>
<p>On a related note, I think <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">iA Writer</a>&rsquo;s lack of full Markdown syntax highlighting (for example, for links and italic text) might turn out to annoy me more than I had anticipated.</p>

<p><img src="https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6224/6308780220_564bcba7ac_m.jpg" alt="Ich, glattrasiert"></p>
<p>Über die letzten vier Wochen hinweg habe ich insgesamt
<strong>€301 für den <a href="http://be.movember.com/en/campaign/nesp/mens-health/">Movember Global Action Plan</a></strong> eingenommen, der die Spenden an die Prostata-Krebs-Forschung und -Vorsorge weltweit verteilt. <strong>Vielen Dank an Susi, Mike, Marcus, Brad, Christian, Hendrik, Alexander, Mario, Dawn und meine Eltern!</strong> Ihr rockt!</p>
<p>Ausserdem habe ich mich tatsächlich mit mehreren Leuten über Prostata-Krebs unterhalten, was zwar nicht unbedingt das lustigste aller Themen ist, aber wichtig. Dafür machen wir den Unfug hier ja schließlich, gell.</p>
<p>Und dann die Updates und Bilder. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/czottmann/sets/72157628027245330/">Oh Gott, die Bilder.</a> Mir wurde recht schnell klar, warum ich normalerweise immer einen Bart trage — ohne sehe ich furchtbar albern aus. Aber glücklicherweise ist mein Haarwuchs verlässlich,
und so wucherte mein Gesicht akzeptabel schnell wieder zu.</p>
<p>Das Endergebnis kann sich sehen lassen, finde ich.</p>

			 <p>Well, <a href="http://blog.zottmann.org/post/12193484608/movember-2011-deutsch">Movember 2011</a> came and went, it&rsquo;s time for one final update.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6224/6308780220_564bcba7ac_m.jpg" alt="Me, beardless"></p>
<p>Over the course of the last four weeks I was able to rake in <strong>a total of €301<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> going to the <a href="http://be.movember.com/en/campaign/nesp/mens-health/">Movember Global Action Plan</a></strong> benefitting prostate cancer research and prevention world-wide. <strong>Many thanks to Susi, Mike,
Marcus, Brad, Christian, Hendrik, Alexander, Mario, Dawn and my parents!</strong> You guys rock.</p>
<p>Also I&rsquo;ve actually talked about prostate cancer with a number of people — it&rsquo;s not necessarily the most awesome topic at a party but it&rsquo;s important nonetheless. And in the end it&rsquo;s what this drive is all about, innit.</p>
<p>And then there were the updates and the pictures. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/czottmann/sets/72157628027245330/">Gods, the pictures.</a> I realized rather quickly why I had decided years ago on going bearded all the time — I look terribly silly without. Thankfully, my hair knows how to grow,
and my face got some of its manly fur back rather quickly.</p>
<p>The results speak for themselves, I think.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7150/6442021525_5ef1914d9a_z.jpg" alt="Quigley, original and fak…hommage"></p>
<p>(By the way, did you realize how crazy expensive it is to get Alan Rickman to

(like pitching in to help me cover my runaway expenses, be my guest.</a>)</p>
<p>In any case, I had fun! The Movember donation box will remain open until Dec 9th, 2011. A big &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to all who participated and chipped in! :D</p>

			 <p>Nachdem <a href="http://hmans.net">Hendrik</a> mir eröffnete, dass Cocktober (fragt ihn…) schon vorbei wäre, war ich sehr traurig. Aber dann fiel mir ein, dass auch dieses Jahr wieder ein <a href="http://movember.com">Movember</a> ansteht, und dann war ich nicht mehr traurig.</p>
<p>Also habe ich mich dort flugs registriert und verpflichtet, mich einen Monat lang zur Wurst zu machen. Und wofür? Für einen guten Zweck:</p>
<p><strong>Es geht darum, Geld für die Prostata-Krebs-Forschung zu sammeln.</strong> Viele Kerle halten diese Untersuchungen ja immer noch für unmännlich, und diesem idiotischen Vorurteil halten aufgeklärte Gentlemen wie ich mit der männlichsten aller fellbasierten Erfindungen dagegen: dem Schnauzbart.
(Englisch: <em>&ldquo;Moustache&rdquo;</em>, daher das Wortspiel &ldquo;Movember&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>Am ersten November rasieren wir uns glatt, und über den gesamten Monat hinweg züchten wir uns dann stylische Rotzbremsen und Suppensiebe, um Aufmerksamkeit für die Krebs-Forschung zu erzeugen und Spenden dafür einzusammeln. Das Geld geht an den <a href="http://be.movember.com/en/campaign/nesp/mens-health/">Movember Global Action Plan</a>, der es koordiniert an die Forschung weltweit verteilt. Ist eine gute Sache.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/12196067293_1.png" alt="Mein 3-Stufen-Plan"></p>
<p>Dummerweise gibt es für Deutschland keine eigene Movember-Site, also musste ich kreativ werden. <a href="http://mobro.co/czottmann">Ich habe mir also ein Profil auf der belgischen Site angelegt</a>, da es die einzige europäische Site ist, auf der man a) in Euro spenden kann und die b) englischsprachig ist.</p>
<p>So, und jetzt kommt Ihr ins Spiel. <strong>Ich würde mich freuen, wenn Ihr für diesen wichtigen, guten Zweck ein paar Euro lockermachen könntet.</strong> Wenn Euch meine enthaarte Gesichtshälfte ebenso schockiert wie meine Frau oder aber genauso erheitert wie mich, <strong>gebt bitte etwas Geld für die Prostata-Krebs-
Forschung. Geht dazu auf <a href="http://mobro.co/czottmann">meine Movember-MoBro-Seite</a> und klickt auf den großen &ldquo;Donate to me&rdquo;-Button</strong> unter meinem noch bärtigen Gesicht. Jeder Euro zählt! Gracias!!!</p>
<p>Zum Dank werde ich Euch auch weiterhin mit meinem Würdeverlust unterhalten —
ich werde jeden Tag ein Foto von meiner langsam zurückkehrenden Männlichkeit machen, und diese Fotos alle ein bis zwei Tage veröffentlichen. Falls Euch der Gedanke abschreckt: niemand <em>muss</em> sich diese Bilder anschauen.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/12196067293_2.jpg" alt="Mir ist kalt."></p>
<p>(Mein Gesicht ist so kalt… Ist das normal?!)</p>
<p>Zum Abschluss möchte ich meiner lieben Frau Dana danken, die ihre Unterstützungsbekundung mit den Worten <em>&ldquo;Du weisst schon, dass Du ohne Bart total bescheuert aussiehst, oder?&quot;</em> eingeleitet hat. ;) (Ja, weiss ich. Das ist Teil der Aktion.)</p>
<p>Ausserdem gilt mein großer Dank den ersten zwei Spendern, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=678035046">Susi Löffler</a>
und <a href="https://mkw.st/">Mike West</a> — Rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll, Kinder!</p>
<p><strong>Also, Ihr alle — auf gehts zum Spenden:</strong></p>

			 <p>When <a href="http://hmans.net">Hendrik</a> told me I&rsquo;m missed Cocktober (ask him…), I was very sad. But then I realized this year&rsquo;s <a href="http://movember.com">Movember</a> is upon us, and I wasn&rsquo;t sad anymore. True story!</p>
<p>So I scrambled to register myself there, pledging to make more of a fool out of myself than usual over the course of the coming month. What for, you ask?
For a good cause:</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m trying to raise money for prostate cancer research.</strong> Many men still shy away from the related cancer exams, considering them decidedly un-manly. Reacting to this silly notion a lot of educated gentlemen like yours truly try to counter it with the most manly fur-based inventions of them all: the moustache. (Hence, &ldquo;Mo-vember&rdquo; — it&rsquo;s quite clever, you see.)</p>
<p>On November 1st, we shave. Oh, how we shave. I, for one, let go of my luscious beard. During the rest of the month we&rsquo;ll grow mighty &lsquo;staches to both direct attention to prostate cancer research and raise money for it. These donations go to the <a href="http://be.movember.com/en/campaign/nesp/mens-health/">Movember Global Action Plan</a> where it is passed on to researchers around the world. It&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/12196067293_1.png" alt="3 stages"></p>
<p>Funny thing: there&rsquo;s no dedicated Movember site for Germany (yet?) so I had to improvise. Thus, <a href="http://mobro.co/czottmann">I&rsquo;ve created a profile on Movember Belgium site</a> which happened to be the only European community site that a) shows donations in Euro and b) is available in English.</p>
<p>Well, and here&rsquo;s where you come in now. <strong>I&rsquo;d like you to support this important, good cause and fork over a few bucks.</strong> Whether my hairless mug is as shocking to you as it is to my wife or as funny to you you as it looks to me, <strong>please donate a few monies to prostate cancer research worldwide. To do that, visit <a href="http://mobro.co/czottmann">my Movember MoBro page</a> and click the big &ldquo;Donate to me&rdquo;
button</strong> below my still hairy mugshot. Every dime counts! Gracias!!!</p>
<p>As a Thank You I&rsquo;ll keep on entertaining you with my loss of dignity — each morning I&rsquo;ll snap a picture of my mug and my slowly returning manliness,
posting them online every other day. Should you find that thought scary: you don&rsquo;t <strong>have</strong> to watch that.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/12196067293_2.jpg" alt="I&rsquo;m freezing."></p>
<p>(My face is freezing… Is that normal?!)</p>
<p>In closing I&rsquo;d like to thank my lovely wife Dana who started her show of support with a hearty <em>&ldquo;You do know you look stupid without your beard,
right?&quot;</em>. Yes, dear, I know. That&rsquo;s part of the concept!</p>
<p>Also a <em>&ldquo;Big ups, playa&rdquo;</em> to my first sponsors, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=678035046">Susi Löffler</a> and <a href="https://mkw.st/">Mike West</a> — rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll!</p>
<p><strong>Well then, people — please donate:</strong></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><strong>TL;DR: ditch RVM on production systems unless you like pain.</strong></p>
<p>A few notes on getting <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">chef-client</a> to install a Ruby 1.9.2 Rails stack on a production box. I&rsquo;ve been spending a good number of hours on this, and I&rsquo;ve learned a couple of things I need to jot down real quick lest I forget.</p>
<p>Preface: as you&rsquo;ll see, I&rsquo;m not a devops guy. I don&rsquo;t have to maintain a lot of servers, so I tend to forget after setting one up that once per year. Eh.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s no current Ruby 1.9.2 package for Ubuntu 10.04. This made me think I would be best off using RVM as it&rsquo;s quite enjoyable and useful in a local development enviroment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">RVM</a> is ace for development work but as it turns out it&rsquo;s kinda shit in a production environment. Up until a few versions ago the system-wide install of RVM was rather solid (for me) as RVM made sure gems for one particular Ruby went into the same folder no matter whether they were installed as root or regular user (let&rsquo;s ignore permissions for a moment here). That meant that even when a gem had been installed by a user the root user would see it &ndash; if he was using the same RVM Ruby.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These days, you have to use <code>rvmsudo</code> to have your root shell use RVM. As provisioning systems like Chef don&rsquo;t know and/or care about <code>rvmsudo</code>, you&rsquo;re bound to run into issues as <code>chef-client</code> will happily keep installing his gems under Ruby 1.8 &ndash; ignoring the 1.9.2 gems. Brilliant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played around with various ways to cram RVM into my root shells, but it&rsquo;s been a wonky affair. It felt rather hacky and wobbly, i.e. not like something I want on my production machines.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Ditching RVM and spending an hour looking for a 10.04-compatible Ruby 1.9.2 package is less fun than it sounds. Hint: there are no current packages. My Linux-fu being what it is I&rsquo;ve decided to not get sidetracked trying to hack together a package myself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally I came to the conclusion that my own <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Knife+Bootstrap">knife bootstrap file</a> would be the way to go. (<a href="https://gist.github.com/993853">Here&rsquo;s the file.</a>) The general idea being that installing/compiling 1.9.2 from source <em>before</em> anything else would make my life easier. Both root and standard user would use the same Ruby install, no need for hacks and detours.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I put it in the right place (<code>chef-repo/.chef/bootstrap/</code>) and then just call it like this: <code>knife bootstrap mynode.example.com -r 'recipe[chef-client]' -x chef --sudo --distro ubuntu10.04-ruby192</code></p>
<p>I was right. Works like a charm.</p>
<p>The rest was a walk in the cake, mostly. Not having RVM as middleman makes installations considerably more stable.</p>
<p>So, in retrospect I wonder why noone has bothered with a Ruby 1.9.2 package for Ubuntu 10.04 &ndash; given it&rsquo;s used on so many servers? It&rsquo;s curious, really.
Also I now know why RVM is absent from so many cookbooks.</p>

			 <p><strong>In which I describe some of the silly fun I had in Volition&rsquo;s 2008 absurdist gang warfare sandbox murder simulator comedy, and why I like it after all.</strong></p>
<p>A few months ago I picked up Volition&rsquo;s 2008 game <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/saints-row-2/61-20679/">Saints Row 2</a> for €12 on a whim. I&rsquo;d bought the German version at first &ndash;which makes sense what with me being in Germany and all&ndash; but shortly afterwards decided to start over playing the uncensored UK version instead as the DE edition is basically a different/crippled game. (The game was really butchered in order to sell it here, to the extent that XBL actually treats both editions as two entirely different games. It&rsquo;s a huge letdown.)</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/5762453072_1.jpg" alt="Saints Row 2 box art, ca. 1978"></p>
<p>Well. Not expecting much but maybe a few hours of slightly awkward silliness and probably nothing else, I was in for a surprise.</p>
<p>You play an unforgiving (and hilariously snarky) gang leader who awakes from a coma which he entered at the end of <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/saints-row/61-5618/">Saints Row 1</a>. Fleeing the surprisingly open high-security prison complex without much trouble, he sets out to revive his old gang, the 3rd Street Saints, with some help from old and new friends.</p>
<p>The story missions are mostly fun and engaging, but not without flaws. Some of the checkpoints had me pull my hair out because they were obviously placed by mad men who hated me personally. Also, there were (very few) occasional glitches, but nothing to lose sleep about. All in all your tasks are fun. So far, so unremarkable on paper.</p>
<p>Yet I came to really like Saints Row 2 because it&rsquo;s not ashamed of what it is,
because it&rsquo;s not afraid to proudly fly its colors: a game for adults who understand that this &ndash;at its heart&ndash; is pure and unadulterated satire.
Volition took the basic setting (gang wars in an urban setting) and made it willfully surreal. It&rsquo;s to real, dramatic gang-related stories what <em>Naked Gun</em> was to gritty, hard-hitting detective movies.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I mean, name another game where you can dress in a pink Borat-style swim suit,
wearing a traffic cone as hat and space-age biker boots &ndash; and then fly an attack helicopter or conduct &ldquo;business&rdquo; meetings. That alone is an indicator of the level of grit, reality and seriousness Volition had in mind when it made Saints Row. They left the grit and deep story telling to the excellent GTA IV that came after it.</p>
<p>Take its mini games for example. Like the one involving insurance fraud. And the one about pleasing ladies in seedy locations<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. And the one about stealing cars. And the one about &ldquo;rescueing&rdquo; other hard-working ladies from their dubious employers. And the one about poopifying<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> parts of the city for money. And the one about ATV-based arson. And the one about running around town butt-nekkid, flashing your pixelated man parts and raking up cash doing so. And many, many more. Most of them are worthwhile, many are so-so, none of them are about making a point in any way &ndash; they&rsquo;re about having fun and making some quick money for your ongoing quest to style your growing number of increasingly elusive cribs in the process, and nothing else.</p>
<p>So yes, gang warfare. You fight three enemy gangs, the police and a big-ass corporation which owns most of the city. And 99% of the time SR2 successfully manages not to question its playful background. Stilwater is a clear-cut caricature of a sprawling US city. It&rsquo;s incredibly easy to get lost there in the gang-related shenanigans of the main characters there, their almost comical lack of regard for other people&rsquo;s lives and property and the often hilarious mission pieces. It is a game that full-well knows it is a game, that its city is a ludicrous sandbox, and that&rsquo;s not shy to brazenly cater to its select audience, both in and outside of missions.</p>
<p>Case in point: there is a particular outlandish cutscene after the, let&rsquo;s say,
&ldquo;forceful eviction&rdquo; of a good number of drifters from the new designated Saints gang hideout. Johnny Gat and the player character sit on a couch,
bodies strewn all around them &ndash; then they banter and fist-bump, and you were forgiven for thinking they were just like two regular dudes after another day of hard labour if it wasn&rsquo;t for the dead guy in front of the couch they were using to prop up their feet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m man enough to tell you: yes, I laughed, exactly <em>because</em> it was crazy.
Volition knew it when they wrote it, I knew it when I saw it, we were sharing a joke there. Was it deep, meaningful high-brow humor? Hell, no. Funny it was nonetheless.</p>
<p>And while the question of morale is avoided for most of the game, it isn&rsquo;t entirely absent. In one of the final missions there is a dialog between the protagonist and his former leader and mentor, where &ndash;in the last minute of said mentor&rsquo;s life&ndash; they discuss their respective motivations. And while the mentor is trying to talk sense into him, telling him all the violence and death can&rsquo;t go on, the Boss (the player character) all of a sudden spouts: <em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a shit… <strong>I own</strong> this city!&quot;</em>. I applaud <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0789478/">Charles Shaughnessy</a>
for his crackerjack voice work as the Boss<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> &ndash; in this very moment I came to realize that this character does have his own agenda after all, apart from allowing me to wield him as my chosen tool in the joyful redecoration of entire Stilwater city blocks. He <em>is</em> a ruthless asshole, even if I came to forget that over all the lol&rsquo;ing and giggling in the hours prior. In that dialog his true colors shone through, and though the entire game is basically a huge hedonistic exercise in violent and juvenile humor, the Boss' short monologue gave him quite a bit of added depth &ndash; it hit home for me.</p>
<p>It was a good, maybe even great moment in an outstandingly insane game. How good? I still remember and think about it, even two months after finishing the game. It managed to give SR2 a slightly different tone that reverberated back from the <em>end</em> of the game through my memories of the whole experience. It wasn&rsquo;t a heavy-handed <em>&ldquo;Gangs are bad, mmkay, kids?&quot;</em>, far from it; again,
Volition acknowledged its audience, recognized it for what it is &ndash;adults&ndash;
and gave a little bit of reinforced context to make a subtle point: they know full well <em>what</em> they&rsquo;re making fun of.</p>
<p>Chapeau.</p>
<p>So my overall verdict of SR2 is <em>&ldquo;absolutely worth my time&rdquo;</em>. I refuse to hand out arbitrary points or scores for games as that system is bollocks anyways.
Instead, I&rsquo;ll opt for <a href="http://monoxyd.de">Marcus'</a> scoring scheme which basically asks you what you would be willing to pay for the game once you&rsquo;ve actually played it.
How much money do you feel is justified for a copy of this game? For me, the answer is:</p>
<p><strong>Saints Row 2: €40.</strong></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few months ago I switched to <a href="http://google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>. It&rsquo;s a solid browser; it does what I want and expect (mostly), it&rsquo;s stable, it comes with a &ldquo;boxed&rdquo; Flash plugin so I don&rsquo;t have to taint my entire system with that POS install that wonderful piece of software system-wide.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come across a number of handy <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">extensions</a> for it. A few of them I&rsquo;m still using them after a couple of months; since I try to avoid cruft creep
(virtual and otherwise) they obviously have some value to me. Thus, I feel some shout-outs are in order.</p>
<h3 id="my-essentials">My essentials</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">1Password</a>: one of the first tools I install on every new machine, and of course it comes with a Chrome extension (as well as others for different browsers).</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alelhddbbhepgpmgidjdcjakblofbmce">Awesome Screenshot: Capture &amp; Annotate</a>: capture an entire web page, a selected area or just the visible part, then make annotations using the built-in tools and either save the resulting file locally or upload it anonymously to their site. <a href="http://awesomescreenshot.com/07aa6wd44">Here&rsquo;s an example</a> of an uploaded screenshot. I like it because it offers a rather streamlined process; I&rsquo;ve played around with equally nice <a href="http://skitch.com/">Skitch</a> but as most screenshots I take are of pages confined in a browser window, as opposed to desktop application windows, the &ldquo;Capture &amp; Annotate&rdquo; addon won. They have a Safari extension available at <a href="http://awesomescreenshot.com/">their site</a>, too.</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nnbmlagghjjcbdhgmkedmbmedengocbn">Docs PDF/PowerPoint Viewer (by Google)</a>: opens/previews PDFs and several MS Office document types in Google Docs instead of downloading them. Given that I don&rsquo;t own MS Office, this is obviously very handy.</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mfidmkgnfgnkihnjeklbekckimkipmoe">FlashControl</a>: the nicest and most configurable Flash blocker I&rsquo;ve found so far. Allows for whitelisting and blacklisting both pages and Flash files, which is rather neat – for example, I can block all Flash content (ads etc.) on a site but have their Flash videos work normally.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rixth/jsbeautify-for-chrome">JSBeautify for Chrome</a>: When looking at a JavaScript file, this extension will offer to beautify it for you. It&rsquo;s full of love.</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hhnjdplhmcnkiecampfdgfjilccfpfoe">Keep My Opt-Outs</a>: made by my man <a href="http://mikewest.org/">Mike</a>, this addon permanently opts your Chrome out of cookie-based ad personalization. It only helps with companies adhering to the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">industry privacy standards</a>, but it&rsquo;s a good start.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.readability.com/account/tools">Readability</a>: I &lt;3 Readability. On a button click the extension removes all the non-content from a given page, presenting me with a distraction-free version while at the same time attempting to pay the site. It&rsquo;s a novel concept which I support wholeheartedly, so I urge you to <a href="http://www.readability.com/">take a look</a> if you have not done so yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha">Stylebot</a>: apply custom CSS rules to any website. Do I need to say more?</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh">Window Resizer</a>: pick a window size from a menu, and have your browser window shrink or grow automagically! Forget flying cars and jetpacks, this is way cooler. Comes with a number of presets and allows for custom sizes.</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ninejjcohidippngpapiilnmkgllmakh">YSlow</a>: Yahoo!&rsquo;s handy page performance tool. Read more about it <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">on its homepage</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nice-to-have">Nice to have</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kaielpkecabnggniojjhghggjedkecfj">Auto HD for YouTube</a>: allows for setting a default/preferred video quality on YT. Also widens the embedded video right away if you want it to.</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oilipfekkmncanaajkapbpancpelijih">Auto Refresh Plus</a>: reloads the selected tab every <em>n</em> seconds/minutes. I use it mostly on the print pages of the <a href="http://guardian.co.uk/">Guardian</a>&rsquo;s live blogs.</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oookoagggbojjfppmpolekejedpkjkmi">iTunes Preview: don&rsquo;t launch iTunes</a>: prevents the iTunes Store preview web pages from launching the desktop app.</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd">RSS Subscription Extension (by Google)</a>: irritatingly enough, Chrome comes without built-in feed auto-discovery. Instead, Google opted for a separate extension. As you would expect, it displays a RSS button in the location bar of a site when it found a feed. On a related note: is it just me, or are RSS feeds losing importance?</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lgdfnbpkmkkdhgidgcpdkgpdlfjcgnnh">Stop Autoplay for YouTube</a>: prevents YT&rsquo;s auto-play but at the same time allows pre-buffering.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="not-sure-yet">Not sure yet</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/glmjakogmemenallddiiajdgjfoogegl">Snipe</a>: a keyboard-based browser tab finder. Think Alfred/Quicksilver/Launchbar for browser tabs. I like the idea but as I&rsquo;ve installed it just today I&rsquo;m not sure yet about its value for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that&rsquo;s that. If you feel like sharing your list of must-have extensions,
let me know in the comments or <a href="http://twitter.com/municode">via Twitter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update #1, 10 minutes later:</strong> Noticed I forgot <a href="https://github.com/rixth/jsbeautify-for-chrome">JSBeautify for Chrome</a>. Added it to the list of essentials.</p>

			 <p>Really nice article in the Guardian&rsquo;s Environment section today: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/mar/18/recycling-waste">A small town in Germany where recycling pays</a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the second Guardian article I&rsquo;ve read in the last few weeks that deals with the German recycling system/culture.  I find them interesting not because they&rsquo;re news to me but because they pose an outsider&rsquo;s view, written to explain the benefits to an interested (?) outside audience.  The system works, it&rsquo;s nothing we think about anymore.</p>
<p>On a related note: here in Munich, bringing waste to the recycling depot is actually <em>free</em> to Munich residents.</p>

			 <p><a href="http://www.mensjournal.com/the-blind-man-who-taught-himself-to-see/print/">&ldquo;Men’s Journal » The Blind Man Who Taught Himself To See&rdquo;</a>:
A terrific, stunning article about Daniel Kish, a blind man who has mastered echolocation to live his life autonomously.</p>
<p>Like most people, I don&rsquo;t know many blind people.  There were none in my neighborhood, there still aren&rsquo;t even though my neighborhood has changed a few times in the last two decades.  Here in Munich you see a good number of white canes (as in any other bigger city), but I do my best to not treat blind or handicapped people any differently.  Why would I?  They are just other people,
living their own lives, they&rsquo;re not helpless victims.  If they need help with anything, they&rsquo;ll probably ask.</p>
<p>Actually, up until a few years ago, I merely tried to ignore them, tried not to stare, out of fear to misstep — the usual behavior, I&rsquo;d say.  That changed for the better when I was working at Yahoo!.  There was a London-based engineer, <a href="http://twitter.com/DesignedByBlind">Artur Ortega</a> (really nice guy,
BTW), who one day came to our office to tell us a bit about the way blind users navigate the net.  He showed us his setup (laptop, screenreader etc.),
and those few hours <em>really</em> were a eye-opening experience for me.  (Pun not intended.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about accessibility that day, but also about seeing with your ears.  His screenreader was yelling at us while he hopped around websites and his machine, and holy shit, that thing talks fast.  And I mean short-
incomprehensible-burst-of-vaguely-speech-like-static fast.  And Artur stood there, in the middle of it all, grinning and working and explaining.  Combine that with the fact that he is constantly traveling around different Y! offices all over the World for talks and work, and all of a sudden it finally hit me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just another guy doing his job.  Yeah, so blind people can&rsquo;t see with their eyes.  Big deal.  If it&rsquo;s awkward, then it&rsquo;s mostly awkward for us, the sighted people.  Because frankly, most of us have no fucking clue how to approach a person who&rsquo;s blind or deaf or different in the first place, because we were never trained for that.  Political correctness isn&rsquo;t always helpful either.  (<em>&ldquo;Is it &lsquo;blind&rsquo;?  Can I say that?  Or is it &lsquo;visually impaired&rsquo;?
Damn, I don&rsquo;t want to say anything wrong!  Forget it, I just walk away, maybe he didn&rsquo;t see me…  OMG, what, no!  I&rsquo;m a bad person, what is wrong with me?&quot;</em> etc.  It may sound funny if I say it like that, but really, it isn&rsquo;t.)</p>
<p>Anyhow.  Great article, go read.  It just reminded me again of Artur and that one afternoon, even though we didn&rsquo;t speak much a since then, and I felt like scribbling it down real quick.</p>
<p>Being blind means just another way of living your daily life, I guess.
Nothing else.  I briefly met other blind people since then, and they all appeared to be rather confident, which makes sense.  Absolutely no need to feel pity.  Different people, different stories.</p>

<p>Funny story from the Yahoo! trenches: a few years after Y! had acquired del.icio.us there still was no internal bookmarking service. There were a lot of pleas from the tech-minded folks to set up an internal del.icio.us instance, which fell on deaf ears. I believe it was <a href="http://randomfoo.net">Leonard Lin</a> of the Upcoming team who then installed a copy of Scuttle, an open-source del.icio.us clone, more or less in his spare time, so we had at least some degree of social bookmarking. (It’s rather handy in team environments in case you’re wondering.)</p>

			 <p><a href="http://tumblr.zottmann.org/post/3162722123/removed-the-auto-posting-of-articles-ive-starred">A few days ago</a> I&rsquo;ve disabled the auto-posting of my <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/starred">starred Instapaper articles</a>, thus forcing myself to ponder about <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> to share and describe a piece before hitting Instapaper&rsquo;s &ldquo;Share&rdquo; button.</p>
<p>I think this worked out well in several regards:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I do less &ldquo;mindless sharing&rdquo;. My old setup meant that I only had to click the little star icon in Instapaper, and the link would be posted on <a href="http://tumblr.zottmann.org">my Tumblr</a>, which resulted in a barrage of articles which I merely liked. Problem is, I am rather easy to please and always willing to share stuff I like with everyone who would lend me an eye or ear – and so I starred a lot of posts. But if I share basically almost everything I read, I&rsquo;m nothing but a goddamn one-man link farm, and that&rsquo;s not a label to aspire to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less fast-food-minded reading. … Well, no, that&rsquo;s not quite correct. Now when I like an article and have a feeling it might be worth spreading, I try to quantify why I like it. So I ended up thinking more about what I&rsquo;ve just read. I don&rsquo;t just munch through my reading list anymore – I chew more slowly. So to speak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As an added bonus, my Instapaper&rsquo;s &ldquo;Starred&rdquo; folder has become more than just a link dump.</p>
</li>

<p>All in all, after a week of testing, I&rsquo;d like to declare this experiment a success. As a result I&rsquo;ll do my article sharing here on my blog – the <a href="http://tumblr.zottmann.org/post/205794372/saturday-morning-breakfast-cereal">funny clown pictures</a> and <a href="http://tumblr.zottmann.org/post/3123228619/regular-ordinary-swedish-meal-time-chop-chop">awesome cooking videos</a> will go to my tumblelog as usual.</p>

			 <p>I like <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuidoc/">YUIDoc</a>. I don&rsquo;t like its default theme. Since I couldn&rsquo;t find any other themes on them internets, I wrote <a href="http://github.com/carlo/yuidoc-theme-dana">my own, named &ldquo;Dana&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Since I normally use YUIDoc to document either pure Javascript or jQuery code<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I didn&rsquo;t keep any of the old YUI code; I&rsquo;ve ditched pretty much everything and started from scratch. And this is what I&rsquo;ve come up with:</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/1042948392_1.png" alt="Screenshot of one of YUI&rsquo;s many many classes"></p>
<p>As you can see in the screenshot, as an example I&rsquo;ve generated the well-known YUI API docs. So here&rsquo;s the original YUI documentation in its <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/docs/index.html">original look</a> — and here is the very same documentation sporting the new <a href="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/stuff/2010-08-31/yuidoc-theme-dana-example/index.html">Dana theme</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you find the latter more pleasing just as I do. :) Click around a bit;
check some of the class documentations for a more in-depth comparison; play with the filters; feel the luxurious yet cheap plastic underneath.</p>
<p>This is a work in progress. It&rsquo;s reasonably stable and working for me so far.
YMMV. If you encounter errors, please <a href="http://github.com/carlo/yuidoc-theme-dana/issues">create a ticket</a>.</p>
<p><strong>You&rsquo;ll find &ldquo;Dana&rdquo; on <a href="http://github.com/carlo/yuidoc-theme-dana">GitHub</a>. If you&rsquo;re so inclined, you can dowload the <a href="http://github.com/carlo/yuidoc-theme-dana/downloads">latest stable release as zip/tgz file</a>, too.</strong></p>

			<h1><a href="https://zottmann.org/2010/08/08/020000.html">Still running: Minimalist, Week 15</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over the last few months I&rsquo;ve been clocking in ~180km in <a href="http://blog.zottmann.org/post/548758650/still-running-going-minimalist">my Vibram FiveFingers</a>. For the most part I take it slow; I run when I feel like it (which is rather often), and I check out routes I&rsquo;ve not ran before. Sometimes these are long, sometimes not so much.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to say that apart from a one-time, mild case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_splints">shin splints</a> caused by running <em>too slowly</em> (I&rsquo;m not kidding) a few weeks back which &ldquo;grounded&rdquo; me for a few days, I am without injury and pain. I run a lot on paved roads these days, due to the currently bad weather and my unwillingness to wrestle muddy tracks. Back in my Nike days, this usually gave me bad <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacroiliac_joint">sacroiliac joint</a> pain. These days, I&rsquo;m fine. No complaints,
really.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve bought a second pair of <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.it/eng/kso.aspx">FiveFingers KSO</a>s a while back, and since my current client is a KSO fan and owner as well I was able to wear them in the office. It&rsquo;s good, really.</p>
<p>So yes, I&rsquo;ve embraced minimalist running. Not just in the shoes department, but also in my mind. My stance towards me running has changed over the last few months; I&rsquo;ve become more relaxed and calm about it. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like a drag anymore, like something you just have to suffer through; I run because I like it and because I want to.</p>
<p>Most days I don&rsquo;t even take a watch with me; I glance at the wall clock when I head out the door and check it again when I come back. That&rsquo;s accurate enough. And in order to find out the distance I&rsquo;ve traversed I turn to Google Earth or <a href="http://www.dailymile.com/people/carlo">DailyMile</a>&rsquo;s handy &ldquo;pedometer&rdquo; map feature.</p>
<p>My feet have become stronger, I think my feets' arches are not as flat anymore, and my toes have straighten out a wee bit. The money I&rsquo;ve spent on my FiveFingers was a good investment in my health, methinks. The downside is that I don&rsquo;t like my &ldquo;real&rdquo; shoes anymore. ;)</p>
<p>A sweet side story: when my parents visited us a few weeks back, they saw the FFs and tried them on, deciding they like them. So they&rsquo;ve both bought a pair, and to my big surprise picked up light trekking as a hobby! Even my mom is having fun. So much, in fact, that they both bought a second pair &ldquo;for colder days&rdquo; — <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.it/eng/ksoTrek.aspx">KSO Trek</a>. Clearly, I&rsquo;m an influencer…</p>
<p>So, minimalist running still works for me; it works very well, in fact. And I still enjoy my Vibrams. And yes, I would and do recommend both to everyone interested in running.</p>

			 <p>Interesting article in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/24/technology/24social.html">NYTimes: Rivals Seize on Troubles of Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I doubt there&rsquo;ll be enough momentum for any of these sites to <em>really</em> take off. And yes, I say that despite me backing Diaspora*. But I believe they will fail to attract a serious following because in the end, you go where your people are, and they&rsquo;re not <em>there</em> yet. Herd mentality meets chicken &amp; egg.</p>
<p>I—as an end user—would need to decide whether my jumping ship @ FB is more important than loosing the &ldquo;posse&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve built there during the time I&rsquo;ve used the site. And I think for most people the answer would be &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That being said, I approve of all of these efforts to build some much needed competition for the four thousand million pound gorilla that is Facebook. The prospect of having a portable profile (see <a href="http://joindiaspora.com">Diaspora*</a> for more info) is exciting, but while I hope that their plans come to fruition (especially their hosted service) I remain skeptical.</p>

			 <h3 id="tuesday-april-27-2010">Tuesday, April 27, 2010</h3>
<p>Wore my Nike Free yesterday, as they&rsquo;re the most flexible (actual) shoes I own. No time for running, tho, also still some residue muscle pain.</p>
<p>Today: Beautiful morning, decided to ignore the bus and walk to the subway.
3.5 km in my Nikes, and while they&rsquo;re pretty good, I miss the ability to wiggle my toes.</p>
<p>Came home, went for a 3.5 km VFF walk with Dana. My calves seem to man up,
finally. With a bit of luck I might be able to go for a run on Thursday again!</p>
<h3 id="wednesday">Wednesday</h3>
<p>Came home, my legs still aching a bit, but I thought <em>&ldquo;eh, what the eff&rdquo;</em> and went for a 5 km run. Didn&rsquo;t even take a watch or anything; I just felt like running. The last time this happened to me was never. And I had fun.</p>
<p>To be honest, the combination of THE BOOK and MY NEW SHOES caused this almost eerie, constant desire to get out and run. I&rsquo;m not making this up; it&rsquo;s uncanny. I&rsquo;ve never had this urge to just crunch some miles. And it&rsquo;s not because of stress at work or anything. I&rsquo;m calm, I&rsquo;m my usual sunny self, not stressed out… It&rsquo;s just a deep-seated feeling that running would be the right thing to do <em>right fucking now</em>. For no apparent reason. (Perhaps they&rsquo;ve put brain-altering chemicals into the book; I don&rsquo;t know… I don&rsquo;t know.)</p>
<p>And I won&rsquo;t lie, I&rsquo;ll enjoy it for as long as it lasts. It might go away tomorrow or next week or in five years time, I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m cool with it. There are worse urges, really.</p>
<p>Also: I can predict the future! Tomorrow, walking will hurt. (I wish my calves would man up quicker.)</p>
<h3 id="thursday">Thursday</h3>
<p>Turns out I can&rsquo;t predict the future after all — I <em>can</em> walk rather painlessly today. Apparently all the extra post-run stretching and muscle rubbing<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> was a good idea.</p>
<p>Had a discussion with another (ex) Y! about running barefoot&rsquo;ish. It&rsquo;s not just about not running on your heels, but about foot strength/health in general. In running shoes, the foot&rsquo;s arch is bolstered and propped up to various degrees. And your toes are pretty much suspended. When running without shoes, the arch acts like a spring, and the toes react to the underground, but they can&rsquo;t do that when shod.</p>
<p>The difference is not just that you&rsquo;re running on your forefeet, it&rsquo;s about giving the foot (and therefore the leg) a chance to work as intended.</p>
<h3 id="friday">Friday</h3>
<p>5 km, &lsquo;twas okay — not more, not less. The humidity took me a bit by surprise,
and my big lunch wasn&rsquo;t helping the cause either. So: eh.</p>
<p>My lower legs are slowly adjusting to the change. Atta boys!</p>
<p>One of the Vibrams is slowly coming apart a bit at the heel (where the mesh is glued to the rubber &ldquo;skin&rdquo;), which is a bit strange after only one week of moderate use. They&rsquo;re not falling apart or anything, their function isn&rsquo;t impaired, it&rsquo;s just a visible &ldquo;glitch&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not too happy with. They&rsquo;re one week old after all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hit the sports store on Monday and ask for either a replacement or (some)
money back.</p>
<h3 id="saturday-sunday">Saturday, Sunday</h3>
<p>Rest of the week were wasted on shitty weather and/or me freezing, so no running.</p>

			 <p>Reading <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6289283-born-to-run">Christopher McDougall&rsquo;s highly interesting and inspirational &ldquo;Born to Run&rdquo;</a>, I came back to my idea of running (semi-)barefoot. Turns out there are a lot of people with the same idea, and companies catering to this idea.
So last Thursday I treated myself to a new pair of <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.it/eng/kso.aspx">Vibram FiveFingers KSO</a>.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/548758650_1.jpg" alt="Vibram FiveFingers KSO"> (My new Vibram FiveFingers KSO)</p>
<p>VFF are basically what you would get if you dipped your feet into molten rubber, minus, you know, the excrutiating pain, blistering skin and earache caused by your own frantic screaming. They&rsquo;re a thin, highly elastic second skin for your feet, and not much else, really. Needless to say, I love them.</p>
<p>Being the serial enthusiast I am, I&rsquo;ll try to keep a short-form diary of my semi-barefoot running progress and findings for my own sake.</p>
<h3 id="thursday-april-22-2010">Thursday, April 22, 2010</h3>
<p>Was paid by a client today, there&rsquo;s money to be spent! Went to the sports store to see whether they have Vibrams in stock; the answer was a resounding yes. Tried them on and was sold. 10 minutes and €105 later I was the proud owner of a brown pair of <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.it/eng/kso.aspx">Vibram FiveFingers KSO</a>.</p>
<p>Wore them on my way home; not bad. A bit strange at first, but I quickly forgot about them. Went home, the weather&rsquo;s nice, decided to go for a quick and easy run. Didn&rsquo;t expect much, but was surprised.</p>
<p><em>Without trying to</em>, I ran the first 5km straight, without much effort or being winded. Had to take a quick breather (while walking) because I was starting to feel light side stitches. Walked for ~250m, then took off again.
When I got home and checked my time, I noticed I had beaten my usual time by roughly 5 minutes. And I was barely exhausted after those 7.4km.</p>
<p>The fun thing about barefoot running (or running with nothing but a <em>thin</em> layer of protection wrapped around your feet) is that your body <em>instinctively</em> knows what to do. You straighten up involuntarily, you
(normally) don&rsquo;t land on your heel but on your fore- or middlefoot, and you keep your feet right below your frame while running.</p>
<p>All you have to do is forgetting your old shod running style, really, and listen to your instincts.</p>
<p>Now, when your feet are cushioned (i.e., stuck in your average shock-absorbing running shoe), you tend to land heel-first while going for long strides. A long stride means more distance covered per step, right? True, but it&rsquo;s rather unnatural, because if you&rsquo;d do it without shoes, you&rsquo;d end up in a world of pain as the body isn&rsquo;t made for this kind of self-beating.</p>
<p>So, after the first few steps in my new VFF my body adjusted. I was going rather slow, well within my comfort zone, my back was straight as a candle,
yet I didn&rsquo;t fall into my usual <em>thump-thump-thump</em> rythm.</p>
<p>Awesome shoes! To be fair, when I got home I definitely felt my calves… they were more sore than usual. No, wrong… They were sore, and they usually aren&rsquo;t.
Then again, usually I am sweat-drenched and exhausted by the time I am back on my own doorstep — not this time, so I consider it a good deal. :)</p>
<p>When Dana came home, she wouldn&rsquo;t stop laughing at them.</p>
<h3 id="friday-april-23-2010">Friday, April 23, 2010</h3>
<p>Holy shit, my calves. They feel like I&rsquo;ve actually used them for the first time in my life.</p>
<p>Still, have a good feeling about the Vibrams; even about my calves. I was expecting sore muscles; after all, I&rsquo;m <em>completely</em> changing the way I run.
Obviously, I&rsquo;ve done that.</p>
<p>Wore the VFF when getting out for lunch. Not much walking there, but I felt like giddy like a little boy about his new Spongebob shoes, and I never want to take them off again.</p>
<h3 id="saturday-april-24-2010">Saturday, April 24, 2010</h3>
<p>Took Dana to the sports store so she could see whether the Vibrams are something for her. Like me (even more like me) she could use stronger feet,
and naturally I want to share this new sensation with her. She&rsquo;s picked out a pair of grey KSO.</p>
<p>After we got home we went for a casual 5km walk on my running trail. She liked it, although her feet and legs were a bit sore. Don&rsquo;t tell her, but I was expecting this. ;)</p>
<p>My calves are still hurting a bit.</p>
<h3 id="sunday-april-25-2010">Sunday, April 25, 2010</h3>
<p>Beautiful day, and despite the slightly sore muscles I decided to run. Not the best idea I&rsquo;ve ever had, really. ;) Now they really hurt.</p>
<p>Well, suits me. I don&rsquo;t blame the shoes, tho. I just didn&rsquo;t listen to my body;
the outcome should teach me.</p>
<p>Stupid me, always pushing too hard.</p>

<h3 id="apps-with-more-than-just-one-framework">Apps with more than just one framework</h3>
<p>The standard MR app template massages <code>$LOAD_PATH</code> a bit in order to have apps which embed the MR framework use said embedded framework in Release builds.
The piece of code in question looks like this:</p>
<p>if Dir.exist?(NSBundle.mainBundle.privateFrameworksPath)
$:.map! { |x| x.sub(/^/Library/Frameworks/, NSBundle.mainBundle.privateFrameworksPath) }
$:.unshift(NSBundle.mainBundle.resourcePath.fileSystemRepresentation)
end</p>
<p>Which is quite alright if all you embed is the MacRuby framework and are building a release. But as soon as you add another one (<a href="http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/">Sparkle</a>, for example), the test will always be true, whether you&rsquo;re debugging without embedding MR or not, and your console will show Ruby load errors. The fix is easy, but it took me a few minutes to find the issue, so here we go.</p>
<p>if Dir.exist?( File.expand_path(&ldquo;MacRuby.framework&rdquo;, NSBundle.mainBundle.privateFrameworksPath) )
$:.map! { |x| x.sub(/^/Library/Frameworks/, NSBundle.mainBundle.privateFrameworksPath) }
$:.unshift(NSBundle.mainBundle.resourcePath.fileSystemRepresentation)
end</p>
<p>Just a heads-up: the <code>rb_main.rb</code> template in the current MR nightlies doesn&rsquo;t contain the code above anymore &ndash; it appears the &ldquo;magic&rdquo; was moved into
<code>macruby_deploy</code> (<a href="http://www.macruby.org/trac/changeset/3528/MacRuby/trunk/bin/ruby_deploy">changeset</a>), so it&rsquo;s likely my fix will be unnecessary in MR 0.6.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new:</p>
<ul>
<li>NEW: The app runs on both 32 and 64 bit Snow Leopard now.</li>
<li>NEW: When auto-sync is enabled and you plug in your reading device, Ephemera will show a &ldquo;Going to sync…&rdquo; dialog for 5 seconds, where you can temporarily disable syncing.</li>
<li>NEW: Support for password-less Instapaper accounts.</li>
<li>FIX: Preferences menu item will be correctly disabled during sync.</li>
<li>FIX: Multiple concurrent syncs will not stall anymore.</li>
<li>PLEASE NOTE: Involuntary archiving of all your unread articles at each sync will happen if you&rsquo;ve set your Instapaper account to automatic archiving. <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/municode/topics/running_ephemera_archives_all_read_later_articles#promoted_replies">See this support thread for how to change said Instapaper setting.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m especially happy about the 32 bit compatibility. Turns out I&rsquo;ve managed to dig up <a href="http://www.macruby.org/trac/ticket/579">an issue in MacRuby 0.5</a>. Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/naixn">Thibault</a> and the rest of the MR crew for hunting it down and <a href="http://www.macruby.org/trac/changeset/3527">fixing it</a>. Hat tip, guys. :)</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using Ephemera already, its auto-updater will pop up soon enough. If not, <a href="http://goephemera.com/">go take a look</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you like Ephemera, feel free to spread the word</strong> (there&rsquo;s a little &ldquo;Share&rdquo; widget on the site), or tell <a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/app/ephemera">IUseThis</a> how you feel about the app. Thanks!</p>

<a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/DOCUMENTATION/Security/Reference/keychainservices/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/SecKeychainAddGenericPassword"><code>SecKeychainAddGenericPassword</code></a>. The guys on <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/macruby-devel@lists.macosforge.org/info.html">the mailing list</a> told me to use a wrapper instead. Doing some reading and poking around the interwebs I finally figured it out, and since it&rsquo;s a neat trick I thought I&rsquo;d scribble it down, so maybe it will safe someone in a position like me a bit of time. ;)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to go with <a href="http://extendmac.com/EMKeychain/">ExtendMac&rsquo;s EMKeychain class</a> because it&rsquo;s simple,
clean, free and has a liberal license (MIT license, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken).</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not a Obj-C person, and what you&rsquo;re about to read is what works for me. I&rsquo;ve tinkered until everything was moving in the right direction. There might be better ways (I&rsquo;m pretty sure there are), and if what I&rsquo;ve done here is bollocks, I&rsquo;d be delighted if you would share your knowledge with me. :)</strong> Also, I&rsquo;d enjoy a comment with your thoughts about this here article. Any opinion will do. Just curious is all.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-build-the-wrapper-emkeychaindylib">Step 1: Build the wrapper, <code>EMKeychain.dylib</code></h3>
<p>First, we&rsquo;ll have to make EMKeychain into a dynamic library. Download it from the site, unzip it, and fire up Xcode. There, start a new project of the type
&ldquo;Cocoa Library&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/370827421_1.png" alt="Starting a new project of the type &ldquo;Cocoa Library&rdquo;"></p>
<p>When asked for the name, call it &ldquo;EMKeychain&rdquo;. It kind of makes sense. This is what you&rsquo;ll end up with:</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/370827421_2.png" alt="New project view"></p>
<p>In the screenshot you&rsquo;ll notice a file called <code>EMKeychain_Prefix.pch</code>. That&rsquo;s a so-called &ldquo;precompiled header&rdquo;; Xcode creates it automatically for you on project creation.</p>
<p>Next, add the files <code>EMKeychain.m</code> and <code>EMKeychain.h</code> to your project by dragging them from the download folder to the &ldquo;Classes&rdquo; folder.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/370827421_3.png" alt="Two files added to the project"></p>
<p>Since the EMKeychain documentation said the class needs to be linked against Carbon and Security frameworks, do that by right-clicking on the &ldquo;Linked Frameworks&rdquo; folder in the tree and selecting <em>Add Existing Frameworks…</em>:</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/370827421_4.png" alt="The linked frameworks show up in my project"></p>
<p>Following the related <a href="http://www.macruby.org/recipes/create-an-objective-c-bundle.html">MacRuby tutorial</a>&rsquo;s advice, add a constructor to the end of <code>EMKeychain.m</code>:</p>
<pre><code>void Init_EMKeychain(void) { }
</code></pre>
<p>Next, adjust the build settings &ndash; switch the base SDK to 10.5…</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/370827421_5.png" alt="Base SDK set"></p>
<p>… and enable GC.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/370827421_6.png" alt="GC enabled"></p>
<p>Build a release, and you&rsquo;ll have your wrapper.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-using-it">Step 2: Using it</h3>
<p>Now for the fun part.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add the just built <code>EMKeychain.dylib</code> to your MacRuby project. (Don&rsquo;t forget to copy the file over.)</li>
<li>Add <code>EMKeychain.dylib</code> to <em>Targets ➔ [project name] ➔ Copy Bundle Resources</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it. <strong>If all went well, you should now be able to use EMKeychain&rsquo;s
<code>EMGenericKeychainItem</code>.</strong></p>
<h3 id="step-3-mopping-up">Step 3: Mopping up</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s very likely that when running your release build it&rsquo;ll crash and burn and complain about a missing <code>/usr/lib/EMKeychain.dylib</code>. In this case, you&rsquo;ll have to adjust the built executable accordingly using
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/Mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/install_name_tool.1.html"><code>install_name_tool</code></a>.</p>
<p>You can do that by adding a new <em>Run Script</em> build phase to the target, which should contain this code.</p>
<pre><code>install_name_tool -change /usr/lib/EMKeychain.dylib \
&quot;@executable_path/../Resources/EMKeychain.dylib&quot; \
&quot;$TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$PROJECT_NAME.app/Contents/MacOS/$PROJECT_NAME&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that on the next build the executable will mope about a missing
<code>/usr/local/lib/EMKeychain.dylib</code> now. Duplicate the snippet and adjust the second one accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-get-yourself-a-beer">Step 4: Get yourself a beer</h3>
<p>Because if all went according to plan, you&rsquo;re done. :)</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve built my first Mac app: <a href="http://goephemera.com">Ephemera</a>, which offers two-way
<a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper.com</a> sync for your ebook reader.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/367163850_1.png" alt="Ephemera main window"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s its story, my motivation, and what it does.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
<p>Ephemera is neither endorsed by nor affiliated with <a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper.com</a> or Marco Arment. I&rsquo;m just a huge fan.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-came-to-be">How it came to be</h3>
<p><strong>A few months ago, in Oct or Nov 2009, about an hour after getting my Kindle 2<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I just <em>knew</em> that it would be the perfect device to read my news on.</strong></p>
<p>I was happy with my <a href="/2009/03/08/review-bookeen-cybook-gen3/">Cybook gen3</a> so far, but once I got the Kindle, it became clear that it could&rsquo;ve been quite a bit more. The whole K2 experience is superior in every imaginable way; the hardware feels more solid, the UI is much better laid out and <em>consistent</em> (a big plus), <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pmn-caecilia/">its font</a> is lovely… I could go on and on. And for whatever reason, I&rsquo;ve never developed the wish to read my news on the Cybook.</p>
<p>So chalk up another one for the Kindle for inspiring me.</p>
<p>Anyways, back then I usually caught up on my news using iPod touch/iPhone,
using the wonderful <a href="http://instapaper.com/iphone">Instapaper app</a>, which (unsurprisingly) is a frontend for the even awesomefuller <a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper.com</a>.</p>
<p>(If you haven&rsquo;t heard of Instapaper yet, go on, check it out real quick, I&rsquo;ll wait. &ndash; Back? Cool.)</p>
<p>Well, how to get my Instapaper content onto my reader, then?</p>
<p>Application development on the Kindle was out of the question, and still is.
(Yes, I know about the upcoming SDK, but what I&rsquo;ve read so far doesn&rsquo;t appeal to me in any way; bandwidth and hardware limitations and somesuch.) The next best thing would be a tool running on the Mac, then. Unfortunately, I knew squat about OSX development.</p>
<p>Hence, I&rsquo;ve decided to keep it simple, and wrote a little Ruby script I would manually run whenever I wanted to sync the device. Worked well, aside from the manual part. It&rsquo;s just too much work! Still, it was nice to see my Instapaper news on my reader with its <em>&ldquo;super-easy on the eyes&rdquo;</em> e-ink screen. Quite early in the process I&rsquo;ve added 2-way synchronization: when I would delete an article on the device, it was automatically archived at Instapaper.com during the next sync. Even nicer!</p>
<p>Still, too much manual work.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>By end of 2009 I&rsquo;ve decided I&rsquo;d go into OSX programming for a change. I had a clearly defined need, there wasn&rsquo;t a tool for it, plus I&rsquo;d never built an OSX app before &ndash; that&rsquo;s enough motivation. So the first three weeks of the year I dove into <a href="http://macruby.org">MacRuby</a> and Cocoa, just grazing Objective-C<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, all while building —<em>drumroll!</em>— <a href="http://goephemera.com">Ephemera</a>.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, my first-ever Mac app! :D And within the time limit, too &ndash; my goal was three weeks from start to finish (&ldquo;finish&rdquo; being <em>&ldquo;have something you can show to other people without completely embarassing yourself&rdquo;</em>), and I&rsquo;ve made it. (BTW, meeting tight goals is awesome, don&rsquo;t underestimate the effect.)</p>
<h3 id="enough-of-the-inane-banter-what-is-it">Enough of the inane banter, what is it?</h3>
<p><a href="http://goephemera.com">Ephemera</a> will comfortably synchronize your ebook reader with Instapaper.com via USB. It works with the Amazon Kindle, Sony readers and pretty much any device capable of reading HTML, Mobipocket or EPUB files,
which should cover quite a bit of ground.</p>
<p>It will fetch your news as single articles or in Instapaper&rsquo;s premade bundles
(Mobipocket &amp; EPUB). Personally, I prefer the former. I can read an article,
delete it on my reader, and during the next sync it&rsquo;ll be archived on Instapaper.com.</p>
<p>Being the lazy guy, I&rsquo;ve also implemented a feature I call &ldquo;Plug, Sync &amp; Go&rdquo;:
If you want it to, <a href="http://goephemera.com">Ephemera</a> will automatically start up, sync, and then unmount your reader when it detects the USB connection. My idea was that you&rsquo;d configure the app once, and then just have it work &ndash; by simply connecting your reader.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to make it as simple and comfortable as possible to get your news onto your reader. For example, the main window has only two buttons, one of them is for opening the preferences, and the important other one <em>you don&rsquo;t even have to press most of the time</em>. So I think I&rsquo;ve succeeded.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not perfect yet, of course, as there&rsquo;s still a lot of work to do, and I do have a number of ideas I&rsquo;d like to implement. But I mean, look: I&rsquo;ve set up a <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/municode/products/municode_ephemera">support site</a> and a <a href="http://twitter.com/ephemera">Twitter account</a>, so you know I mean business,
right? ;)</p>
<p>At the moment <a href="http://goephemera.com">Ephemera</a> runs on 10.5 and up 10.6<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, 64 bit Intel only. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll add 10.4 support, but I&rsquo;m working on the 32 bit version (MacRuby is giving me quite a bit of flak on that front).</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2010-02-16:</strong> I&rsquo;ve released v1.1 today, which runs on all Snow Leopard machines.</p>
<h3 id="dev-notes">Dev notes</h3>
<p><a href="http://goephemera.com">Ephemera</a> was made possible by <a href="http://macruby.org">MacRuby</a>. MacRuby sits on top of Objective-C, can be embedded &amp; compiled, which means you can build self-
contained applications.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started using MacRuby v0.5b2; last weekend v0.5final was released. They say it&rsquo;s not ready for production yet, but I laugh in the face of danger,
quite manly actually, because that&rsquo;s how I roll. ;) But yes, it&rsquo;s still a bit rough around the edges (for example, as mentioned before I couldn&rsquo;t get the compiled 32bit versions of the app to work, so <a href="http://www.macruby.org/trac/ticket/579">I&rsquo;ve filed a ticket</a> and hope someone will look into it).</p>
<p>Also, due to the lack of void pointer support there were issues with accessing the OSX Keychain (i.e. it didn&rsquo;t work), so I had to work around that. I&rsquo;ve managed to do that; on the upside I know now how to bundle Obj-C libraries in
<code>.dylib</code> files which you can then use from MacRuby. (A seperate article on this topic is coming up soon <a href="http://blog.zottmann.org/post/370827421/accessing-the-keychain-with-macruby">has been written</a>, keep an eye on <a href="http://blog.zottmann.org/tagged/macruby">the MR section</a> of my site if you&rsquo;re interested.)</p>
<p>That being said, if you&rsquo;re feeling a bit adventurous, take a look. It&rsquo;s quite a remarkable and exciting project. Writing OSX apps using Ruby is fun and enjoyable once you get the hang of it. Also, <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/macruby-devel@lists.macosforge.org/msg03368.html">there are brave men working on getting MacRuby going on the iPhone.</a></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Forgot two links to good non-web resources &ndash; you might want to check out <a href="http://peepcode.com/products/meet-macruby">Peepcode&rsquo;s &ldquo;Meet MacRuby&rdquo; screencast</a> as well as
<a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/bmrc/programming-cocoa-with-ruby">PragProg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Programming Cocoa with Ruby&rdquo; book</a>. The latter is a RubyCocoa book, but the overall principles of app development apply to MacRuby as well.</p>
<h3 id="thats-all-folks">That&rsquo;s all, folks</h3>
<p>Anyways, that&rsquo;s the story. I know it&rsquo;s not an app for everyone, but it&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote something <em>I myself</em> would use on a daily basis, and that counts for something. I&rsquo;ve showed it to a few people, and some of them actually replied and helped me testing (thanks Mike, Norm, Bernhard &amp; Mat).
The overall feedback was very positive, which is encouraging, to say the least.</p>
<p>Yes, and I&rsquo;m proud of myself. In the eternal words of Chuck Noland<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>:

			 <p><em>This post references <a href="http://macruby.org">MacRuby</a> 0.5b2, used with Xcode 3.2 on Snopard
(10.6.2).</em></p>
<p>At some point you&rsquo;ll probably want to create a release build for your app.
You&rsquo;d like to compile it and embed the MacRuby framework so the app is self-
contained. Cool beans.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not as easy as it seems. Yes, the MacRuby Xcode template contains both an &ldquo;Embed&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Compile&rdquo; target, and they <em>seem</em> to work fine.
;) The problem I ran into, though, was that whenever you would <code>require</code>
anything from the Ruby standard library (say, <code>yaml</code> or <code>stringio</code>), the app would forget about the embedded version of MR and look for
<code>/Library/Frameworks/MacRuby.framework/…</code>.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t notice this at first since this folder exists on my dev machine (big surprise), but when I tested it on a clean machine (i.e. one where MacRuby isn&rsquo;t installed), nothing would happen. Well, nothing except some lines in the system.log, that is:</p>
<p>Being a newb to the ancient arts of compiling shit self-written software I was scratching my head rather furiously. It took me several hours of digging around the Googles and <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/macruby-devel@lists.macosforge.org/info.html">macruby-devel</a> to learn about <code>install_name_tool</code>,
and how it&rsquo;s used to adjust the path of a shared library inside a file.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I did, then. I&rsquo;ve created a new build target, &ldquo;Embed and Compile&rdquo;, which has two sub-targets:</p>
<ol>
<li>the reference to the default app build phase (which means &ldquo;MyNewApp&rdquo; is a direct dependency of the &ldquo;Embed and Compile&rdquo; target)</li>
<li>a &ldquo;Run Script&rdquo; build phase named &ldquo;Embed, Compile, Fix&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>The script runs <code>macruby_deploy</code> and afterwards tells <code>install_name_tool</code> to do its dirty, dirty work. I found it&rsquo;s not enough to have it adjust the executable only; for me it was necessary to fix all the <code>*.rbo</code> files as well.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s it. The above works for me, it might work for you as well. If you have comments, suggestions or recommendations, <em>please</em> sound off below. I&rsquo;m still learning all of this, and any input is appreciated. :)</p>
<p>Oh, and in case I sound ungrateful or anything: I am not. MacRuby 0.5b2 is exactly what is says it is: the second beta of a software&rsquo;s pre-1.0 version.
It&rsquo;s already pretty damn impressive but not really done yet. I had a hunch what I was getting into, so it&rsquo;s cool. ;)</p>

			 <p>Some things I&rsquo;ve learned or discovered during the last few days. Nothing special, but taking notes is usually a good idea, so there.</p>
<h3 id="get-values-frominfoplist">Get values from<code>Info.plist</code></h3>
<p>For example, app name and version:</p>

NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace.openURL(url)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="run-an-applescript">Run an AppleScript</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to execute a short AppleScript snippet to save yourself some time by using the higher-level functionality AS offers instead of writing a huge block of MacRuby. (For example, to eject a FS volume.) Here&rsquo;s how you do it (the AS is deliberately simple):</p>
<pre><code>script = &quot;display dialog (\&quot;omg\&quot;)&quot;
pnt = Pointer.new_with_type(&quot;@&quot;)
as = NSAppleScript.alloc.initWithSource(script)
as.executeAndReturnError(pnt)

<h3 id="delete-nodestags-from-an-xml-document">Delete nodes/tags from an XML document</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have a variable <code>doc</code> which represents a <code>NSXMLDocument</code>, and you want to remove all <code>em</code> and <code>cite</code> tags:</p>
<pre><code>error = Pointer.new_with_type(&quot;@&quot;)
selectors = [ &quot;//em&quot;, &quot;//cite&quot; ].join(&quot;|&quot;)
doc.nodesForXPath( selectors, error: error ).each do |n|

			 <p>Just a note, mostly to myself: The default XCode MacRuby <code>rb_main.rb</code> template will contain these lines:</p>
<pre><code>Dir.entries(dir_path).each do |path|
  if path != File.basename(__FILE__) &amp;&amp; path.match(/\.rb$/)
    require(path)
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Works fine for uncompiled files, but when you want to compile your app,
there&rsquo;ll be no <code>*.rb</code> files — just <code>*.rbo</code> files. So <code>rb_main.rb</code> needs to be adjusted.</p>
<pre><code>Dir.entries(dir_path).each do |path|
  if path != File.basename(__FILE__) &amp;&amp; path.match(/\.rbo?$/)
    require(path)
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>I just spent 15 minutes wondering about these <code>Unknown class 'Controller', using 'NSObject' instead. Encountered in Interface Builder file at path …</code> in my system log, and I tend to forget this kind of detail so I wanted to jot it down as a reminder to future Carlo.</p>
<p>So, listen up, future Carlo. This is <em>important</em>.</p>

<li>2008 ended with me getting unemployed. The decision being made for me was a catalyst to finally make my move. I was planning to get out of employment in 2009 anyways, so, you know. Thank you, Yahoo!.</li>
<li>Early in the year I went freelance. As mentioned, I had played with the idea for a while by then, so that was pretty cool. And scary.</li>
<li>Got a few clients, and managed to keep a good <em>&ldquo;client work vs. own projects&rdquo;</em> ratio. I&rsquo;m not getting rich working like this, but I&rsquo;d like to be truly happy in my job for once, so it&rsquo;s important for me to keep the balance there.</li>
<li>My first freelance project, a WoW-related site named <a href="http://blog.zottmann.org/post/210093564/charpool-has-launched-theres-a-new-wow-site-in-town">CharPool</a>, was a personal success, but failed nonetheless. About a month after launching it other sites with similar functionality came out and kind of crushed it. I guess I had waited too long to act on the idea for the site. So, in December, I&rsquo;ve turned the server off. Well, live and learn.</li>
<li>Speaking of learning, I&rsquo;ve learned a boatload of new things this year. Lots of Ruby-related things, of course, but also a lot of *nix stuff. Fun!</li>
<li>Among other things, I rewrote my Twitter contact management site <a href="http://twerpscan.com">TwerpScan</a> — and had the chance to give a <a href="http://blog.zottmann.org/post/212896563/twittwoch-munchen">quick talk about it</a> for a mixed audience here in Munich. Another first for me, and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed it.</li>
<li>Got myself two ebook readers, a <a href="http://blog.zottmann.org/post/210093545/review-bookeen-cybook-gen3">Bookeen Cybook Gen3</a> and a <a href="http://bit.ly/7ocEhe">Amazon Kindle 2</a>. Both nice, but the latter wins, hands down. What a refined piece of technology!</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m currently knee-deep in RubyCocoa code, which I consider a road to MacRuby, which I need for my next big project… Loving it!</li>
<li>Finally got me an iPhone.</li>

<li>In August, I had the honor of being best man for M &amp; E. Beautiful, beautiful wedding. It was an absolutely wonderful weekend. I love you guys. :)</li>
<li>We went up to Northern Germany for a nice vacation, including hooking up with my man <a href="http://hmans.net">Hendrik</a> who showed us <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his hellhole of a city<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the (mostly) pretty parts of Hamburg ;), and a visit to the <a href="http://www.buga-2009.de/en/">BUGA 2009</a> (i.e. the annual &ldquo;German Federal Horticultural Show&rdquo;).</li>

<h3 id="games--movies">Games &amp; Movies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Biggest surprises this year: <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/game/batman-arkham-asylum-xbox360">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a>, <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/game/assassins-creed-2-xbox360">Assassin&rsquo;s Creed II</a>. Both games I knew about but didn&rsquo;t have much interest in, until <a href="http://mikewest.org">Mike</a> would lend them to me, and then… I really didn&rsquo;t see them coming, but they hit me <em>hard</em>. Good stuff. :)</li>
<li>Also notable this year: the two <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/game/grand-theft-auto-4-xbox360">GTA IV</a> DLC packs, <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/game/halo-3-odst-xbox360">Halo 3: ODST</a>, <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/game/halo-wars-xbox360">Halo: Wars</a>.</li>
<li><em>Avatar</em> — holy shit. That movie really hit the spot for me. Also great: <em>District 9</em>. A good year for scifi, methinks.</li>

			 <p>Somehow, after connecting my new Logitech G9 Laser mouse tonight, two keys on my MS Natural Ergo keyboard were swapped. Highly annoying. After some digging around the Googles, I learned that in order to &ldquo;reset&rdquo; your keyboard —i.e.
making OSX forget your keyboard type— all you have to do is a</p>
<pre><code>rm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist
</code></pre>
<p>Once done, disconnect the keyboard, plug it in again, and the <em>&ldquo;New keyboard found, wot is it?&quot;</em> dialog will pop up again. Problem solved, case closed.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.raneri.it/blog/eng/index.php/2009/01/17/how-to-reset-the-mac-keyboard/">Riccardo Raneri</a>, on whose blog I found this hint. Credit where it&rsquo;s due.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A while ago I&rsquo;ve decided to do a little time travelling. In literature, that is. So I&rsquo;ve picked up a novel called <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/641633.City_at_World_s_End">&ldquo;City At World&rsquo;s End&rdquo;</a>, written by one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Hamilton">Edmond Hamilton</a>. It&rsquo;s a story about a little rural community in the US heartland having a &ldquo;super-atomic bomb&rdquo; go off above it, causing a rift in time, catapulting said city into the far future, and the fight of its citizens to remain on Earth. Adventure!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/234303270_1.png" alt="&ldquo;City At World&rsquo;s End&rdquo; cover"></p>
<p>It is exactly what it sounds like: pure pulp. The characters are rather flat;
the premise is unintentionally hilarious. Yet, it&rsquo;s a pretty charming read. :)</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;ve picked the book up at <a href="http://feedbooks.com/book/2357">feedbooks.com</a>, I had a hunch about what I was getting myself into. After all, this novel is (at the time of this writing) <em>58 years</em> old. That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s from 1951. But I&rsquo;ve chosen the book for exactly that reason (also I was told it had spaceships) — I wanted to know what successful scifi was like in the 50&rsquo;s of the last century. From their point of view, I&rsquo;d probably be like one of them &ldquo;space folks&rdquo;.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> But how would I end up thinking about their view of the future? How would I end up describing their vision of the times to come?</p>
<p>Turns out I&rsquo;d only use one word, as before: &ldquo;charming&rdquo;. Well, that and &ldquo;a bit naïve&rdquo;. :)</p>
<p>An example. Said rural community, called Middletown, leaps one million years into the future. One <em>million</em> years! The sun is dying, the Earth is cold,
mankind has spread across the galaxy… yet all humans they meet are still ordinary humans like you or me.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Given that the first homo sapiens entered the stage just around 400.000 years ago, one would expect meeting rather different beings after another 1.000.000 years. Apparently, evolution took a break or something.</p>
<p>But at least there are aliens! One of them is Chewbacca. No, I&rsquo;m not making that up. There&rsquo;s a Capellan (i.e. an alien from Capella) whose description is pretty much 100% Chewbacca. He&rsquo;s big, hairy, ape-like, friendly, loyal and a very good engineer. His name is Gorr Holl. — I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE, GEORGE LUCAS.</p>
<p>Then there are the communications. People tend to park their spaceships just out of town (they have spaceships!), yet someone forgot to invent the walkie-
talkies, because there&rsquo;s still a lot of people running back and forth, waving and yelling to alarm the others.</p>
<p>Also, the space-age people from one million years in the future are familiar with Einstein. That&rsquo;s fame, I&rsquo;m telling you. (No mention of Michael Jackson,
tho.)</p>
<p>And then… women. Oh, the women, what with their constant wailing or their firm resolve or their pre-Doris Day&rsquo;ish behaviour. Really, the picture painted of the females is an interesting one, saying quite a bit about the age the book was written in. On the one hand, we have Carol, the protagonist&rsquo;s girlfriend.
She&rsquo;s the friendly, quiet type who likes the &ldquo;old ways&rdquo;. (Not what you think.)
Beneath her surface is a fragile young woman, almost a girl still, shaken to her core. On the other hand, there&rsquo;s the new space love interest, Varn Allan from space, the administrator of this neck of the woods space. On the outside,
she&rsquo;s a cold and efficient bureaucrat! But during the book, we learn that beneath her surface there&rsquo;s a fragile young woman, almost a girl still, shaken to her core. Diversity! Dope.</p>
<p>So. I know the comparison is not entirely fair, but putting <em>&ldquo;City At World&rsquo;s End&rdquo;</em> and its long-term vision (I fail to come up with a better term) next to today&rsquo;s books, like <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17863.Accelerando"><em>&ldquo;Accelerando&rdquo;</em> by Charles Stross</a> or (less hard scifi) <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51964.Old_Man_s_War"><em>&ldquo;Old Man&rsquo;s War&rdquo;</em> by John Scalzi</a>, it looks, well, less visionary.
I am aware that in terms of &ldquo;scifi seeds&rdquo; today&rsquo;s authors have a better (?)
starting point than the authors 50 years back, but they seem to do a better job in dreaming up a future working as canvas for their books. Maybe I&rsquo;ve just picked the wrong author here, who knows. And maybe the people in the 50s just weren&rsquo;t ready for too &ldquo;far-fetched&rdquo; visions yet?</p>
<p>Anyways. The tech and the portrayal of the people are equally fun, and reading the book made me grin and laugh quite a bit. But of course snickering is easy for me, from my cushioned seat in front of my computron device. It&rsquo;s 2009!
Yes, we may have global warming and a outrageous lack of everyday space travel and jetpacks, but still: it&rsquo;s an exciting time to be alive. There&rsquo;s new technology surfacing almost weekly, from biotech to personal gadgets to propulsion engines and whatnot.</p>
<p><strong>Well, my verdict: If you are wondering what to read next, get yourself an old scifi book.</strong> You might have fun. Many of them are free &amp; legal downloads by now. Both <a href="http://feedbooks.com">Feedbooks</a> and <a href="http://manybooks.net/">ManyBooks</a> (if it&rsquo;s up…) are good places to start looking. And if you&rsquo;re unsure what to get, either just pick one with closed eyes or ask around at <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/czottmann">GoodReads</a>. :)</p>

<h3 id="on-the-desk">On the desk</h3>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/225698723_1.jpg" alt="The desk."></p>
<p><strong>iMac 24&quot;, 3.06 GHz C2D, 4GB RAM, early 2009 model.</strong> His name is Rupert, and he&rsquo;s great. Got him in February after my previous iMac&quot; broke down after running ~3 years straight.</p>
<p><strong>Dell 2005FPW.</strong> Really nice and affordable monitor. Tilted by 90°, because I can.</p>
<p><strong>iPod touch 16GB.</strong> I don&rsquo;t leave home without it.</p>
<p><strong>JBL On Stage.</strong> It was a parting gift I got from my co-workers a few years back, and I really like it. I mostly use it for the iPod dock these days, but I&rsquo;ve packed it a few times to serve as a portable sound system while on the road.</p>
<p><strong>MS Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000.</strong> One of the best ergo keyboards on the market, hands down. Oh, and yes: that&rsquo;s a wire. I think a wireless desktop keyboard is an useless concept — it&rsquo;s sitting on your desk, about half a meter away from your computer, it&rsquo;s rarely moved (if ever). This is a very common scenario, and in my book it&rsquo;s stupid to waste energy (batteries etc.)
for powering a wireless connection to bridge a distance that short.</p>
<p><strong>Logitech MX510.</strong> Good, affordable, reliable mouse. Also cable-bound, see above. Sitting on a <a href="http://gta.wikia.com/TW@">tw@</a> mousepad.</p>
<p><strong>Sennheiser headset.</strong> Full sound, the mike is a bit quiet, not the USB version.</p>
<p><strong>CanoScan LiDE 200.</strong> No-frills flatbed scanner.</p>
<p><strong>iWork &lsquo;06 Install DVD.</strong> Used as coaster.</p>
<p><strong>Belkin n52.</strong> Funky little left-hand keyboard/peripheral, mostly for gaming,
but I&rsquo;ve heard of people using it for serious work like 3D stuff. Might be a myth, tho.</p>
<p><strong>Belkin 7port USB hub.</strong> It&rsquo;s not bad. Has some troubles with my external soundcard, tho.</p>
<p>Not pictured:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>13&quot; black MacBook, 2GB.</strong> Also running Snopard, and kept lean. Used for working remotely.</li>
<li><strong>Western Digital MyBook Pro, 500 GB, Firewire.</strong> For backups.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Xmod.</strong> Keeps me from having to plug my headphones in and out all the time. If there was a software solution which would let me switch sound output between the built-in speakers and the headphone jack, I wouldn&rsquo;t need this.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-the-dock-in-my-mind">In the dock, in my mind</h3>
<p>I ride the Snopard, naturally.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://macromates.com">Textmate</a></strong>, of course. What else?!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/">Tweetie</a>.</strong> I like it for keeping track of my <a href="http://twitter.com/municode">various</a>
<a href="http://twitter.com/TwerpScan">Twitter</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/Charpool">accounts</a>. Both on the Macs and the iPod.</p>
<p><strong>Terminal.</strong> I prefer it over pretty much every other shell app so far.</p>
<p>My <strong><a href="http://github.com/carlo/homedir">homedir repo</a>.</strong> This is one of the first things I install on each of my local &amp; remote boxes. All command-line-related stuff goes in there,
the very same repo is used for each machine, and it&rsquo;s just crazy handy. Tip of the head to <a href="http://github.com/norm/homedir">Norm</a> for the initial one and <a href="http://github.com/bradleywright/homedir">Brad</a> for a suitable version to fork from. :)</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/">Mailplane</a></strong>. The ability to keep an eye on several Google Mail accounts at once is nice.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">Launchbar</a>.</strong> Awesome. Besides app launching I mostly use it for its clipboard history and calculator.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion">VMWare Fusion</a></strong> for all my virtualization needs. Got a cheap license a few months ago and never looked back.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTcyOTg5">Dropbox</a>.</strong> On all of my machines. Lovely, lovely piece of software.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a></strong> for all my todo needs, on all my machines, including the iPod.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently giving <strong><a href="http://www.busymac.com/busysync/">BusySync</a></strong> a spin. After trying to coerce Snopard&rsquo;s native Google Calendar conduit into a) synching two 2 machines and b) not sucking for a few hours I&rsquo;ve decided my time is too valuable to keep trying, and went with BusySync. Which is really nice and painless so far.
I&rsquo;ll probably buy it once the trial is over.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.phg-home.com/index_mac.html">Minuteur</a></strong> for Pomodoro-like 2-hour sprints. (The
<a href="http://pomodoro.ugolandini.com/">Pomodoro app</a> is a bit too much for my taste. It&rsquo;s not bad, but not for me.)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>(What a title…) I was pulling my hair out over the last two days when I was implementing bulk operations in a project of mine.</p>
<p>In this case, the list of operations to do in bulk is compiled in the browser,
and then the single requests are sent one by one to the server as single AJAX requests. (Think &ldquo;mark this as read&rdquo; functionality.)</p>
<p>My problem was that the first and second call in the bulk list usually went through well, but the rest of the calls just ran against a wall since all of a sudden Rails had problems finding the either logged in user or was missing certain methods and/or attributes. Highly annoying as well as completely erratic, as I was sure my code was okay in the first place.</p>
<p>When trying the same operations on a one-by-one basis, all was good. No issues whatsoever.</p>
<p>So while trying to figure out what the fuck was going on, I&rsquo;ve played around with different ways to get the current user, checking for the availability of its methods and so on, all to no avail.</p>
<p>At one point I&rsquo;ve disabled the <code>protect_from_forgery</code> call, and one or two different errors started to appear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>A copy of ApplicationController has been removed from the module tree but is still active</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was new. So I&rsquo;ve started digging around for an answer, and found it in an old <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/153066">Ruby Forum thread</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out that Rails' development mode was the culprit, as the app&rsquo;s code is reloaded on every request; so when a lot of concurrent calls are made, the code might reload slower than the calls are coming in and hijinks ensues.</p>
<p>The overly simple solution to this problem? In
<code>/config/environments/development.rb</code>, I just set <code>config.cache_classes</code> to
<code>true</code>, meaning the code isn&rsquo;t reloaded all the time — and as it turns out, my code runs just fine after all! Happy happy joy joy.</p>
<p>The downside is that I&rsquo;ll have to restart my dev server every time I make a code change, but in this particular case, that&rsquo;s not a big deal.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Just a heads-up: I&rsquo;ve moved my blog today — in two ways. First, I&rsquo;ve ditched my self-hosted Wordpress setup in favor of <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>. Because I ♥
Tumblr.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Second, it&rsquo;s now sitting on <a href="http://blog.zottmann.org">blog.zottmann.org</a> instead of
<a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org">carlo.zottmann.org</a>. Old article URLs 301-redirect to their new locations,
so all should be well.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve cleaned up the blog history; about 2/3 of the old posts are gone.
Most of them either simply lost their context, contained nothing but (now)
broken links or are not worth keeping online. Doing my part to keep the intertrons lean!</p>
<p>The move was made possible by Wordpress' export-to-XML feature, the <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/api">Tumblr API</a> and <a href="http://gist.github.com/210359">a few lines on Ruby code</a>. (The latter is a big hack job, but it works for me. You&rsquo;ve been warned.)</p>
<p>And to top it of, I&rsquo;ve picked a new <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/theme/1843">Tumblr theme named &ldquo;PostCreate&rdquo;</a> and hacked it to my liking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased so far. :)</p>

			 <p>Letzte Woche war ich auf meinem ersten <a href="http://twittwoch.de/">Twittwoch</a>, logischerweise auf dem
<a href="http://www.twittwoch.de/blog/2009/09/23/7okt">in München</a>. Da <a href="http://twitter.com/codeispoetry">Thomas Pfeiffer</a>, der Organisator, nach Leuten gesucht hatte, die Vorträge halten wollen, hab ich natürlich gleich die Chance ergriffen, etwas über TwerpScan zu erzählen.</p>
<p>Der Vortrag lief gut, auch wenn ich mich am Anfang etwas mit der Technik gestritten habe, aber es gab Fragen, Reaktionen und auch Lob von einigen Usern, die meine kleine Site schon kannten. Sowas freut mich natürlich immer.
Manchen schienen etwas überrascht, dass TwerpScan aus München kommt, und nicht in fremden Landen gebaut wurde.</p>
<p>Die anderen Vorträge kamen vom <a href="http://www.michaeljaeger.tv/">Schauspieler Michael Jäger</a>, der mit einer Social-Media-Kampagne seinen Traum von der Rolle des Tatort-Kommissar vorantreibt. <a href="http://www.flobbymedia.de/blog/">Florian Bergmann</a> stellte das Konzept der Barcamps vor.
Valentin Pletzer von Chip zeigte uns <a href="http://moviecritter.com/">moviecritter</a>, eine Twitter-basierte Movie-Reviews-Site. Und Markus Gladbach von der Messe München stellte die
<a href="http://www.discuss-discover.com/">discuss and discover</a> vor.</p>
<p>Alles in allem wars ein runder Abend mit einem interessierten Publikum,
interessanten Talks (und damit meine ich nicht den meinen!) und guten Gesprächen. Ich hab nette Leute kennengelernt, einige Bekanntschaften etwas vertieft, und es gab Bier. Was will man mehr. :)</p>

			 <p>Yesterday&rsquo;s <a href="http://munich-on-rails.com">Munich on Rails</a> meetup was the usual mix of interesting talks and geeky, delightful conversations. When I say &ldquo;usual&rdquo;, I of course mean it&rsquo;s been the kind of evening I by now kind of expect. ;) Many thanks to
<a href="http://moriz.com">Roland</a> for organizing and the <a href="http://experteer.de">Experteers guys</a> for the venue and the food. Nom!</p>
<p>Anyways: interesting talks.</p>
<p><a href="http://simplabs.com/">Marco Otte-Witte</a> presented his <a href="http://github.com/simplabs/excellent">Excellent</a> gem (gotta love the name)
for static code analysis. It&rsquo;s mostly aimed towards checking Rails code for smell, although —and he made that clear— it&rsquo;s not targetted at people who strive for the blissful state of &ldquo;zero warnings&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s more relaxed in that way; merely showing you unusual (or stupid or silly) parts of your code, such as missing validations in your models or having instance variables in your partials and the likes. Sadly, at the moment it&rsquo;s not dealing with HAML templates yet, just ERB. (He&rsquo;s looking for volunteers, by the way.;)) Here are
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/marcoow/excellent-2173489">the slides</a>:</p>
<p>I can actually see myself using it.</p>
<p>And then Sven C. Koehler presented his somewhat irritatingly named<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> yet spiffy <a href="http://github.com/sck/localmemcache">Localmemcache</a>. It&rsquo;s a local, shared-memory-based, persistent key/value store, which looks pretty fascinating. I was a wee bit confused by it until it finally clicked — you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell from its name, but it&rsquo;s <em>not</em> related to <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">memcached</a>. Aha! It&rsquo;s a C library with Ruby bindings which offers a more or less simple storage system (values are of the type
<code>String</code>, but of course that would include <code>Marshal</code>&lsquo;ed data) and apparently blazingly fast — his benchmarks showed that Localmemcache is almost as fast as accessing native Ruby hashes. Its not for everyone —for example, as I understand, it requires a 64-bit Unix system— but it looks like a pretty interesting alternative to memcached for single-machine setups like, say, your single production machine or your local dev box. This should ease the issue of sharing data between different Ruby processes, for example. I&rsquo;m definitely going to check that out.</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="http://www.workingwithrails.com/person/14317-peter-schrammel">Peter Schrammel</a> presented a concept for a truly private asset server. As I&rsquo;m not entirely sure whether this is really public information yet, I&rsquo;ll keep my yapper shut here. :)</p>
<p>Afterwards we all headed to the <a href="http://parkcafe089.de">Park Café</a> for conversations and drinks.
All in all a very nice evening, even though I was still a bit groggy from the day before — the <a href="http://blog.clipflakes.com/2009/10/08/clipflakestv-prasentiert-twittwoch-in-munchen/">München Twittwoch</a>. (Which reminds me, I should probably whip up a quick post about that as well. Eh.)</p>
<p>Again: my thanks go to the MoR organizers and all the people who showed up, I had a good time. :)</p>

			 <p>So, gestern also Bundestagswahl. Durch den Ausgang der Wahl ließ ich mich dann <a href="http://twitter.com/municode/status/4421900515">zu folgendem Tweet</a> hinreissen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bullshitrattenfängergeschwätz funktioniert also immer noch in DE! Glückwunsch an Die Linke &amp; FDP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gut, das war vielleicht etwas undifferenziert. :p Aber die Wahl macht mir in mehrerlei Hinsicht Magenschmerzen.</p>
<p>Ich fürchte, den dringend überfälligen Atomausstieg können wir auf unbestimmte Zeit abhaken, das Thema wird jetzt begraben. Und durch die sicherlich anstehende Laufzeitverlängerung der AKWs werden die Stromversorger sicherlich wenig Muße haben, in erneuerbare Energien zu investieren. Das wäre große Scheisse, wenn ich das mal so formulieren darf. (Das Thema wurde ja schon überall zur Genüge diskutiert.) Ich glaube nämlich, dass das Festhalten an der Abschaltung den Markt animieren würde, der Krise kreativ zu begegnen. Ich glaube daran, dass der Markt reagieren würde — man muss ihn halt nur lassen.</p>
<p>Desweiteren finde ich die geradezu volksverdummenden Wahlversprechen, die von o.g. Parteien (und auch anderen) gemacht wurden, grob unverantwortlich. Die Herren Lafontaine und Gysi mit ihren vollmundigen <em>&ldquo;mehr von allem für jeden für umsonst&rdquo;</em>-Ansagen handeln bestenfalls fahrlässig, sind dabei allerdings sehr erfolgreich, was mich stark betrübt. Nicht, weil ich generell was gegen einen sozialeren Staat hätte, keineswegs; ich reagiere nur allergisch auf offenkundigen Bullshit.</p>
<p>Was mich zur FDP &amp; CDU/CSU bringt: wer angesicht des aktuellen Bundeshaushalts die Dreistigkeit besitzt, Steuersenkungen in Aussicht zu stellen, gehört (im freundlichsten Fall) ignoriert. Und das System, das zum aktuellen Weltwirtschaftsdilemma geführt hat, als Weg aus dem aktuellen Weltwirtschaftsdilemma zu propagieren, das ist dreist und gefährlich ignorant. Nichts gelernt, Fakten ignoriert, und stolz darauf? Uncool.</p>
<p>Allerdings möchte ich nicht alle Wähler in einen Topf schmeissen, das wäre falsch. Millionen Menschen haben Millionen Gründe, warum sie wählen, was sie wählen. Und das ist okay. Ich kann nur sagen, was mich ärgert: die Subgruppe der Wähler, die aufgrund der o.g. Beispiele ihr Kreuz bei diesen Parteien gemacht haben.</p>
<p>Nun denn: schwarz-gelb. Ärgert mich das? Ja, aber in erster Linie deshalb, weil es zeigt, das in Deutschland derlei offensichtlicher Stimmenfang-Bullshit toleriert und honoriert wird. Aber wird davon das Abendland untergehen? Nein. Werden wir in vier Jahren alle am Hungertuch nagen oder auf Einhörnern in den Sonnenuntergang reiten? Sicherlich auch nicht.</p>
<p>Und hey, <em>wenigstens haben wir Wahlen</em>. Und eine freie Presse. Und ich kann sowas schreiben, ohne von der Polizei abgeholt zu werden. Dies' Land ist schon geil, auch mit schwarz-gelb.</p>
<p><strong>Demokratie, FUCK YEAH.</strong> :)</p>

		<a href="https://zottmann.org/2009/09/11/upgrading-to-snow.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2009-09-11 02:00:00 &#43;0200">Sep 11, 2009</time></a>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve made the switch from Leopard to Snow Leopard today. First, I took the necessary steps, of course: checking <a href="http://snowleopard.wikidot.com/">this handy app compatibility list</a>,
running <a href="http://metaquark.de/appfresh/">AppFresh</a>, then <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a>. While the overall install went smoothly on my mid-2009 iMac 24&quot;, I ran into some issues which I&rsquo;d like to jot down real quick.</p>
<ul>
<li>Terminal.app has issues with my favourite programming font, <a href="http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a>. The font isn&rsquo;t rendered at all, which is a pain. I went with Menlo (the new monospaced font coming with Snopard) for the time being. (In Textmate, Inconsolata renders just fine.)</li>
<li>The <em>Language &amp; Text</em> preference pane refuses to allow me to use the &ldquo;German - Microsoft&rdquo; layout. It&rsquo;s a 32-bit vs 64-bit issue with <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/29220/microsoft-intellitype">MS' Intellitype software</a> (which is needed for my Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000) — the 32-bit drivers can&rsquo;t be used in 64-bit apps, and the keyboard reverts to its default &ldquo;German&rdquo; layout. According to <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=10124424#10124424">this Apple support board post</a> it&rsquo;s not even clear whether there&rsquo;ll be a 64-bit Intellitype software at some point. Saying this is inconvenient would be an understatement.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve switched from 1Password 2 to <a href="http://www.switchersblog.com/2009/08/update-1password-on-snow-leopard.html">1Password 3 Beta</a> since 1Password 2 would&rsquo;ve required me to run Safari in 32-bit mode; v3 doesn&rsquo;t. Looking good. Can&rsquo;t say more due to the NDA. :)</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest seems to be fine. Standing out most:</p>
<ul>
<li>Booting the iMac seems to be faster now.</li>
<li>Image Capture finally recognizes my CanoScan LiDE 200 scanner out of the box! (About time.)</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, not a bad update. The family license goes for €49, so I didn&rsquo;t have to think long about it.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I was able to fix the keyboard problem! Today I found <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=ukelele">Ukulele</a>, an Unicode keyboard layout editor. After downloading it, I&rsquo;ve poked around the DMG and found two files, <code>LogitechGerman.keylayout</code> and <code>LogitechGerman.icns</code>. After copying them to the <code>/Library/Keyboard Layouts/</code>, all that was left was opening the <em>Language &amp; Text</em> preference pane and activating the &ldquo;Logitech German&rdquo; layout. Dynomite!</p>

			 <p>Eure Sendungen sind scheisse.</p>
<p>Nein, wirklich. Ich meine das nicht böse oder abwertend, sicher nicht. Ich seh nicht oft fern, bin von daher auch sicherlich nicht Teil der werberelevanten Zielgruppe. Aber ich finde, Ihr strengt Euch nicht mehr so an wie früher.</p>
<p>Erinnert Ihr Euch noch an die gute alte Zeit? Ihr hattet nur 5 oder 6 Kochshows im Programm; &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; lief noch da, wo es hingehört (nämlich bei Euch, nicht bei RTL) und hatte nur 3 Werbepausen und nicht gefühlte 18; Herr Mälzer bereitete auf sehr lockere und durchaus unterhaltsame Art und Weise leckere Speisen aus seiner und anderer Menschen Kindheit zu; das &ldquo;Perfekte Dinner&rdquo; war auch noch recht neu und mehr aufs Essen denn auf die Schubladen und wirren Vorlieben der Teilnehmer fixiert; und hin und wieder schneiten Enie van de Meiklokjes und Herr Kühler bei irgendwelchen unbekannten Mitbürgern vorbei und rissen ihnen die Hütte ab. Das war Fernsehen, bei dem man sich wohlfühlen konnte.</p>
<p>Das ist allerdings lange her.</p>
<p>Vor ein paar Tagen schaltete ich beim Abendessen dummerweise mal wieder auf VOX, und stolperte über ein Format namens <a href="http://www.vox.de/vox-dokus_10757.php">&ldquo;mieten, kaufen, wohnen&rdquo;</a> (das auf Eurer Site irritierenderweise als &ldquo;Doku&rdquo; geführt wird). Da gehts um komplett unwichtige Leute, oft mit zuviel Geld, die auf der Suche nach einer permanenten Bleibe sind. Wenn die Leute wie Zuhälter aussehen oder aufstrebende junge Frauen &ldquo;am Anfang ihrer Gesangskarriere&rdquo; (Zitat Einblendung) sind, umso besser. Wirklich, ein rundes Magazin. Sehr interaktiv!</p>
<p>Ich vermute jetzt einfach mal, dass Ihr es als &ldquo;interaktives Fernsehen&rdquo; wertet, wenn ich die ganze Zeit meinen TV anschreie.</p>
<p>Die Sendung war schon nicht schlecht, aber ich glaube, da geht noch was. Sicher, Ihr habt Rainer Calmund beim Abspecken im Programm, genauso wie &ldquo;Mein Revier&rdquo;, wo Ordnungshüter beim Von-Arschgesichtern-vollgelabert-werden gefilmt werden<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, und auch noch einige andere Perlen der investigativen Unterhaltung. Ich versteh schon, Ihr wollt das echte Leben zeigen. Ist ja auch nicht verkehrt. Aber mal ganz ehrlich… Ihr könnt das besser!</p>
<p>Aus diesem Grund war ich so frei, mir noch ein paar Konzepte zu überlegen, die ihr umsetzen könntet. Über meinen Namen im Abspann oder großzügige Geldgeschenke (bitte kein Koks!) würde ich mich freuen, aber dies ist nicht zwingend notwendig.</p>
<h3 id="meine-fußgängerzone">&ldquo;Meine Fußgängerzone&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Nehmt fünf Durchschnittsbürger, die sich nicht kennen, aber in der gleichen Stadt wohnen, und lasst sie Euch die zentrale Fußgängerzone ihrer Stadt zeigen. Gutes Vermarktungspotential: die angrenzenden Einzelhändler sind bestimmt bereit, ein paar Euro für mehr &ldquo;Exposure&rdquo; zu zahlen. Am Ende stimmen Passanten, die die Aufzeichnung nicht gesehen haben, über die Fünf ab. Noten von 1 bis 10 werden verteilt, wer am Ende 50 Punkte hat, bekommt eine Kiosklizenz.</p>
<p>Pro-Tipp: Geht auch als zusätzliche Wochenend-Version mit Verhaltensauffälligen, i.e. &ldquo;Promis&rdquo;, die z.B. durch die Kö oder Lüdenscheid traben.</p>
<h3 id="damals-gestern-heute">&ldquo;Damals, gestern, heute&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Menschen von der Straße, die keiner kennt, rezitieren die BILD-Schlagzeilen von gestern oder vorgestern, so sie sich noch daran erinnern. Gern auch mit Aufregern! Das kommt immer gut an. Fußball, Ficken, Friedensverhandlungen im Westjordanland — die Themen sind letztendlich wurscht, wichtig ist nur, dass &ldquo;einfachere Gemüter&rdquo; (nicht abwertend gemeint!) die Chance bekommen, sich bei der (versuchten) Selbstdarstellung als Bildungsbürger lächerlich zu machen.</p>
<p>Pro-Tipp: Kann auch als Samstagabend-Format für RTL produziert werden, wo bei Oliver Geissen verlorengeglaubte/-gehoffte Verhaltensauffällige, i.e. &ldquo;Promis&rdquo;, vor dem Greenscreen die BUNTE-Schlagzeilen der letzten Woche wiederkäuen. Wenn Ihr das irgendwie mit Musik kombinieren könnt, interessiert sich sicherlich auch Hugo-Egon Balder dafür.</p>
<h3 id="tanküberfall">&ldquo;Tanküberfall&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Ein Tankwart wird den ganzen Tag mit der Kamera begleitet. Es gibt unzählige Tankstellen, die Woche hat sieben Tage, das Format könnte also ewig laufen.</p>
<p>Pro-Tipp #1: Hin und wieder könnte ein Verhaltensauffälliger, i.e. &ldquo;Promi&rdquo;, mit seinem gemieteten Sportwagen zufällig an der Tanke des Tages vorbeischauen. Passt nur auf, dass Ihr Jürgen Drews nicht zu oft deswegen anruft.</p>
<p>Pro-Tipp #2: Für genügend Geld verkauft Euch <a href="http://moriz.de">Roland</a> vielleicht auch die <a href="http://tankueberfall.de">passende Domain</a>. ;)</p>
<h3 id="taube-bischof-heim">&ldquo;Taube, Bischof, Heim&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Ein Einmal-Pro-Woche-Format: Die Wochenrückblende aus der Sicht eines bitteren, pensionierten Klerikers mit Hang zur Ornithologie, der in einem Altenstift wohnt. Ganz ehrlich, dafür braucht Ihr nicht mal einen Drehplan, sowas dreht und sendet sich praktisch von selbst. Wenn das kein Dokutainment ist, dann weiss ich auch nicht.</p>
<p>Pro-Tipp: Irgendwie Otto Waalkes unterbringen. (Mitglied des Pflegepersonals?)</p>
<h3 id="catch-me-if-you-can">&ldquo;Catch me if you can&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Kennt Ihr <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadliest_Catch">&ldquo;Deadliest Catch&rdquo;</a>? Geht in Deutschland natürlich nicht so, weil m.E. die meisten Leute die Beringstraße für einen Berliner Zubringer halten (siehe &ldquo;Damals, gestern, heute&rdquo;). Die Thematik (Fischer bei der Arbeit) ist aber trotzdem spannend; vor allen Dingen, wenn man sie —Achtung!— aus der Sicht der Fische betrachtet! Ganz genau, die Kamera begleitet Seetiere, sowohl in der Nord- und Ostsee als auch in Binnengewässern. Man könnte z.B. Welse mit Webcams versehen. Das könnte Deutschlands erste Unterwasser-Edutainment-Show werden!</p>
<p>Pro-Tipp: Es würde sich anbieten, zwei Serien zu machen, eine für die hohe See, eine andere für stehende Gewässer im bayrischen Hinterland. Das Hobbyangler-Segment ist noch nicht ausreichend abgedeckt, glaube ich.</p>
<h3 id="pro-bohno">&ldquo;Pro-Bohno&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Tägliche Show (30-45 min), die aus mehreren statischen Blickwinkeln das Treiben in einem Coffeeshop sendet. Think &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; ohne Container und mit mehr Laptops. Wäre billig herzustellen: einfach ein paar Webcams aufstellen, und die Streams live zusammenstellen. Der Vorteil wäre, dass der Laden nach ein paar Tagen von noch unbekannten Verhaltensauffälligen (und evtl. auch Boris Becker und/oder Jürgen Drews) überrannt werden würde, die dann versuchen, sich vorteilhaft mit Gesang, Tanz und lockerem Auftreten zu präsentieren.</p>
<p>Pro-Tipp #1: Nach ein paar Wochen könnte man als Steigerung dann einen Rückkanal in den Coffeeshop legen, d.h. ein Fernseher, über den Dieter Bohlen live die Kaffeekäufer beleidigt.</p>
<p>Pro-Tipp #2: Am Samstag könnte man für RTL eine 1-Stunden-Show mit Oliver Geissen produzieren, wo Verhaltensauffällige, i.e. &ldquo;Promis&rdquo;, vor dem Greenscreen… na, Ihr wisst schon.</p>
<h3 id="schlusswort">Schlusswort</h3>
<p>Das sind jetzt nur ein paar Ideen. Die sind alle geil! Und ich hab weder gekokst noch getrunken!</p>
<p>Wie gesagt, über Rückmeldungen und Geldgeschenke würde ich mich freuen. VOX, macht mal was Neues. Ihr wart mal mein #1-Sender der Privaten. Aber all der Unfug, der jetzt bei den Privaten läuft (nicht nur bei Euch), haben mich zu einem begeisterten Zuschauer der Öffentlich-Rechtlichen gemacht. (Srsly, ARTE, Phoenix und der ZDF Dokukanal sind super!)</p>
<p>PS: An alle, die sich jetzt amüsiert haben: glaubt ja nicht, dass das nicht passieren könnte — solcher Mist läuft schon lange, und zwar überall.</p>
<p>PPS: An alle, die sich jetzt amüsiert haben, und bei einem anderen privaten TV-Sender als VOX arbeiten: <strong>Euer Sender ist vermutlich noch viel beschissener.</strong></p>

			 <p>Since its birth a few years ago, my Firefox addon <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/211/">BetterSearch</a> has been a fun project. People were using it and seemed mostly happy with it, as they could see a thumbnail of the search results on their favourite search engine before actually clicking through. Good times.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2009/06/1218984718-300x217.jpg" alt="BetterSearch screenshot"></p>
<p>This was made possible by displaying preview thumbnails from various sources, such as Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa service and several others. These thumbnails had to be bought from them, which was financed by money I made as an Amazon affiliate. When BetterSearch would find an Amazon product in the list of search results, it would not display the Amazon.com thumbnail but the actual product image, along with the price, average rating and related information. When a user would click through, and buy stuff from them, I (as their affiliate) would get a few cents.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This worked out well. It paid for server, bandwidth and thumbnails, and yes, I&rsquo;ve made some extra money from it. Not much, but a bit.</p>
<p>Then, around end of 2008, Amazon changed the terms of their affiliate program &ndash; all of a sudden, what BetterSearch (and several other addons for different browsers) were doing wasn&rsquo;t allowed anymore. No more tagging of so-called &ldquo;organic search results&rdquo;. Oh noes! The Amazon partner program-related code had to go.</p>
<p>This put me in a somewhat tough spot. On the one hand, I liked my addon, and I know a lot of people were using it on a daily basis. On the other hand, it was just a side project, and the only source of income to counter the costs had suddenly dried up — and to be honest, as much as I like BetterSearch, it&rsquo;s nothing I was willing or able to invest lots of money in just for the fun of it.</p>
<p>But luckily, the company of a former co-worker of mine was looking for something like BetterSearch. They were interested in buying the addon, and we came to an agreement.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-that-mean">What does that mean?</h3>
<p><strong>It means BetterSearch, the Firefox addon, is now owned by <a href="http://www.abakus-internet-marketing.de/">Abakus Internet Marketing</a>.</strong> They will continue to develop it, they will run its servers, pay for the bandwidth and the thumbnails — in a nutshell, everything BetterSearch is theirs now.</p>
<p>For the end user, not much will change — apart from a vastly expanded number of available thumbnails, that is. Firefox will update the addon whenever there&rsquo;s a new version, the way it was before. No need to manually install or adjust anything.</p>
<h3 id="whats-not-part-of-the-deal">What&rsquo;s not part of the deal</h3>
<p><strong>No user-related data was passed along.</strong> First and foremost, BetterSearch didn&rsquo;t collect any user data. But of course there&rsquo;s always the case of the thumbnail server logfiles. Everytime a thumbnail is requested, it&rsquo;s noted in a server logfile, along with the user&rsquo;s IP address. (That&rsquo;s the <em>modus operandi</em> for pretty much every server everywhere on the internet. Ask your local geek about the details.) Since I don&rsquo;t care about this stuff, these logfiles were deleted on a daily basis anyone looking at them.</p>
<p>Either way, these server log files were not part of the deal.</p>
<h3 id="the-future">The future</h3>
<p>I think the addon&rsquo;s future is a bit brighter now as it was a few months ago. Now there&rsquo;s someone with sufficient resources to maintain and further develop BetterSearch. To me, that&rsquo;s a good thing. :)</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Some people think it is &ldquo;amoral&rdquo; to tag Amazon links in such a way, and claimed it was sneaky. I disagree with both points. For me, it added meaning and context to the Amazon search results. And the information that this was done was disclosed on the addon&rsquo;s website, its <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/211/">AMO page</a> and in the addon&rsquo;s preferences dialog. Everybody using the addon <em>decided</em> to use it. Free will and all that. So there.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			<h1><a href="https://zottmann.org/2009/05/16/020000.html">CharPool Has Launched: There&#39;s A New WoW Site In Town</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://zottmann.org/2009/05/16/020000.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2009-05-16 02:00:00 &#43;0200">May 16, 2009</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over the last few years, I have always wondered why there was no site that would allow me to track my progress in World of Warcraft. Sure, there&rsquo;s the
<a href="http://eu.wow-armory.com/">WoW Armory</a> and sites like Raptr, but all these places take more of a
&ldquo;your char right now!&rdquo; approach which never came close to what I had in mind.
And those that did go into the direction I was thinking didn&rsquo;t <em>click</em> with me.</p>
<p>But what exactly did I have in mind? This is where it gets a bit complicated.
I was looking for a site that would automatically keep track of my characters for me, make daily snapshots, let me upload images and notes… Give me a timeline of their progress… In short, something that would allow me to <em>document</em> the &ldquo;life&rdquo; of my toons. Maybe something that would give me a bit more, with &ldquo;more&rdquo; still being a very diffuse idea.</p>
<p>Anyways, I always felt this was strange there was no such site, as I believe there&rsquo;s an audience for that. So many people do invest so many hours, so much energy and money into the game, I can&rsquo;t possibly be the only one wanting.</p>
<p>I ended up firing up TextMate and starting to code, and only a short while
°cough° later, I had something I deemed good enough to release as a beta.</p>
<p><strong>Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you <a href="http://charpool.net/">CharPool</a>.</strong></p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/210093564_1.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a CharPool.net character page"></p>
<p>The site does exactly what I&rsquo;ve described a few paragraphs ago, but it also throws in (in my opinion) funky Twitter support, whereas you can tweet in the name of your characters, and these tweets will show up on the chars timeline,
together with your achievements and screenshots etc. It also has feeds.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a page which shows you the WoW-related tweets of your guild mates and also of the people you are following on CharPool. The guild support is still rather rudimentary, and at the moment is mostly just a hint at things to come. Again, it&rsquo;s Twitter-based, because I&rsquo;ve read somewhere on AOL that it is what the &ldquo;cool cats&rdquo; are &ldquo;digging&rdquo; right now.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>So, I am having plans for CharPool. Big plans. But it&rsquo;s still in its infancy,
there&rsquo;re a few rough edges, and <strong>I&rsquo;ll need testers to take a look, poke around, and give me feedback</strong>. Preferrably WoW players, because, you see,
without active characters the site is rather pointless. :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve opened up <em>250 beta slots</em> which are given away on a &ldquo;first come, first serve&rdquo; basis. I&rsquo;d appreciate it if you could <a href="http://charpool.net/">take a look</a> if WoW is your cup o' tea. If not, maybe you know someone who is a player? Then you could pass him a note.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

			 <p>A post on the <a href="http://www.mobileread.com/">MobileRead forums</a> hinted at my <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/2009/03/08/review-bookeen-cybook-gen3/">Cybook Gen3</a> stability issues being related to the font face used for displaying text, so I&rsquo;ve replaced the very lovely <a href="http://www.dafont.com/liberation-serif.font">Liberation Serif</a> with the slightly less lovely,
but nonetheless enjoyable <a href="http://dejavu-fonts.org/">DejaVu Condensed Serif</a>.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, the stability improved tremendously — my Cybook hasn&rsquo;t crashed once since I&rsquo;ve switched.</p>
<p>So, yes, the crashes/lockups are definitely font issues. The more you know.</p>

			 <p>One of the first applications I&rsquo;ve installed after buying my iPod touch last year was <a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/">Stanza</a>, one of the few dedicated ebook reading tools for the platform.</p>
<p>The idea of electronic reading appeals to me. I&rsquo;ve tried my luck several times over the last few years, on different devices, with varying success. (Anyone remember Palm? Haha, yeah… me neither.)</p>
<p>First of all, I like a good novel. Being able to carry a number of them around with me, wherever I go, is a good thing. Back then I was spending almost two hours each day in public transit, and imagine that: reading beats staring at subway tunnel walls the whole time.</p>
<p>My second argument is a bit more elaborate. You see, I&rsquo;ve read a lot of books in my life, most of them just once. Not everything written by man is a gem begging to be re-read time and time again. And while this is okay &ndash;not everyone can be Shakespeare, and most of these books I&rsquo;ve enjoyed at least <em>a bit</em>, after all&ndash; it raises the question of what to do with them after reading. There are so many &ldquo;one-off&rdquo; books in my basement, it&rsquo;s not really funny anymore. Some of them I gave away, some I&rsquo;ve sold, some I&rsquo;ve fed to a recycling bin. But the others are sitting there, silently, and everytime I look at them I wonder a) what to do with them and b) how much wood was used up to make them. (Yes, I&rsquo;ve actually had a point to make here.) Thus, I&rsquo;d feel less bad about getting said one-time-read-through novels in electronic form.</p>
<p><img src="//farm4.static.flickr.com/3404/3255446424_c9f5ac2527_m.jpg" alt="Bookeen Cybook Gen3"></p>
<p>Anyways: After a few months with Stanza I&rsquo;ve decided electronic reading works well enough for me to warrant a dedicated device for home use &ndash; a real ebook reader. After some shopping around, comparing prices and reading up on different offerings I went with the <a href="http://bookeen.com/">Bookeen Cybook gen3</a>.</p>
<p>After a few weeks of using it a lot I now feel comfortable enough to share my findings. I know at least a few people are curious about it &ndash; hi <a href="http://ultramookie.com/">Mookie</a>
&amp; <a href="http://www.geek-happens.com/">Bernhard</a>. ;)</p>
<h3 id="quick-facts">Quick Facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>6&quot; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-ink">e-ink</a> screen</li>
<li>600x800 pixels, 166 dpi</li>
<li>B&amp;W, 4 grayscale</li>
<li>No backlight, naturally</li>
<li>Multi format: reads Mobipocket (DRM and non-DRM), HTML, PDF, TXT, PalmDoc,
image formats etc.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Both EPUB and better PDF support are promised for the <a href="http://bookeen.blogspot.com/2009/02/adobe-pdf-and-epub-will-be-present-in.html">upcoming firmware update</a>. (Hopefully this&rsquo;ll include reflowing text in PDFs.)</li>
<li>Has an SD slot &ndash; in case the 512MB onboard storage isn&rsquo;t enough.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rather affordable: I&rsquo;ve ordered mine in the UK, and paid €225 incl. shipping to Germany. The box contained the Cybook, a short pamphlet, and an USB cable. Not more, not less.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a light device: Only ~170g, battery included.</li>
<li>The screen is great, the time it takes to turn a page is surprisingly short and not noticeable anymore after reading a few pages.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s no proprietary software to be installed. Connect it to your Mac/PC, and it&rsquo;ll show up as mass USB storage device in your Finder/Explorer. This is also how you put new content on the device. I like that.</li>
<li>Truetype support: Don&rsquo;t like the built-in fonts? Just copy TTF files to the device and use them instead. I <em>really</em> like that.</li>
<li>Rather simple and logic menu layout. The menus mostly make sense.</li>
<li>Handy display controls: Font family, font size, layout (justification etc.).</li>
<li>Impromptu bookmarks: Turning off the device or going back to the &ldquo;library&rdquo; (i.e. the main list of stored texts) during reading will make a note of your progress. Going back to the text later on will bring back to you where you&rsquo;ve stopped reading.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t support EPUB yet, but apparently this will be &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; within the month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The PDF support is… well, let&rsquo;s just say that yes, it displays most PDF files. But it either tries to cram one document page into the space of the 6&quot; screen or flips the display 90° and shows either the upper or lower half of the document page. It works, but it ain&rsquo;t fun, yo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No page numbers: There is an (optional) horizontal bar at the bottom of the screen to display how far you&rsquo;ve progressed through the book. It&rsquo;s a neat idea, and a good alternative to page numbers. Well, in theory. It&rsquo;s an idea that wasn&rsquo;t fully thought through, as you can also jump to any page using its page number through the menu. Which is somewhat useless, as the current page number isn&rsquo;t indicated number anywhere. It&rsquo;s just not displayed. I know that on a device that supports different font families and sizes, calculating page numbers can be a drag, but come on: the navigation currently in place is only 4 parts working &ndash; and 1 part barely sufficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stability:</p>
<ul>
<li>It locks up every now and then, which puts me in the strange situation that I had to <em>reboot my book</em>. (There&rsquo;s a tiny reset button on the back of the device.)</li>
<li>Since the reading progress is only stored during shutdown or upon return to the library but naturally not during a lockup, the device will not remember where I was when the crash happened. So after a reset the last automatically saved bookmark will be used &ndash; my progress made between opening the text and the lockup will be lost. This is unfortunate, as there is no &ldquo;forward ten pages&rdquo; menu option, so I usually end up flipping through dozens of pages after a crash, looking for the right page.</li>
<li><em>Update:</em> The crashes <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/2009/04/11/update-on-the-stability-of-the-bookeen-cybook-gen3/">are apparently directly related to the font used</a> &ndash; using DejaVu Serif Condensed instead of Liberation Serif helped the stability quite a bit. YMMV.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not all books come with a TOC, and it&rsquo;d be nice if the Cybook would autogenerate one. Alas, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m having problems opening the PDFs from the <a href="http://www.suvudu.com/freelibrary/">Suvudu Free Library</a>, which makes me a sad panda. I hope this will change with the aforementioned firmware update.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the available three library views all that much. They&rsquo;re a wee bit uninspired.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-useless">The Useless</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plays MP3.</li>
<li>On the left side of the device there are four buttons. Only three of them have a function.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="diy-improvements">DIY Improvements</h3>
<p><img src="//farm4.static.flickr.com/3422/3255447168_c9b42b83c2_m.jpg" alt="DIY: Finished."></p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted a cover to protect the screen, but didn&rsquo;t want to spend money on them &ldquo;official&rdquo; leather covers. So I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/czottmann/sets/72157613382876380/">…molested a Moleskine</a>
(<em>ahem<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></em>). Which actually worked out pretty nicely after all. Because I am a man of many talents! Oh yeah.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dafont.com/liberation-serif.font">Liberation Serif</a>. &lsquo;nuff said.</li>
<li>Impress the ladies: <a href="https://dev.mobileread.com/trac/mobiperl/wiki">MobiPerl</a> and <a href="http://wiki.github.com/why/hpricot">hpricot</a> make for a good team.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-verdict">The Verdict</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s no <a href="http://blag.xkcd.com/2009/02/25/kindle-2/">Kindle 2</a>. It&rsquo;s a neat device without frills. It&rsquo;s not perfect.
But it&rsquo;s affordable and works, and I don&rsquo;t regret the purchase.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><em>This is a reblog of <a href="http://rooohby.tumblr.com/post/81164277/god-gotchas">a post</a> from my new <a href="http://rooohby.tumblr.com/">Ruby-themed tumblelog</a>. I know it&rsquo;s kind of cheap to repost your own stuff, but who cares.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a couple of hours today pulling my hair out while trying to get one of my background job scripts to work with <a href="http://god.rubyforge.org/">god</a>, the &ldquo;easy to configure,
easy to extend monitoring framework written in Ruby&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Well, it took a while to make it work, tho. Yes, god is cool and simple and gets the job done. But there are some things that cost me hours and which I found out only by reading the source code.</p>
<p>So, I just want to quickly jot down some gotchas before I forget them again,
running the risk of falling into the same traps again in the future.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>My script used the constant <code>LOG</code> to keep my <code>Logger</code> instance. Logging worked fine when I ran the script by itself, yet when god took over, it didn&rsquo;t anymore. Actually, the script died rather quickly. As there was no logging at all going on, and all STDOUT output was suppressed, I came rather close to losing it. Turns out god itself is declaring a <code>LOG</code> constant of its own, which was done before my script had the chance, so when it attempted to initialize it, it would actually try to re-declare an existing constant, and we all know how well that works. ;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once that was done, my script was logging just fine, but it didn&rsquo;t produce any output whatsoever. Raah! Teeth were gnashed… there was definitely teeth gnashing going on. Even telling &ldquo;my&rdquo; <code>Logger</code> (the one inside my script) to write to a file didn&rsquo;t produce anything. That was a fun hour, really. The reason for this behaviour: god is closing all open file descriptors when it sets up monitoring a script. Which included my script. Awesome! On the upside, it meant I could get rid of the part of my code dealing with different logger behaviours. Meaning less LOC! It doesn&rsquo;t get any more agile than that, folks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In case you actually want to capture anything your original script is sending to STDOUT, there&rsquo;s the not-really-documented <code>God::Watch#log</code>. Set it inside your <code>God.watch</code> block to specify a log file. (See example below.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need to set ENV variables, <code>God::Watch#env</code> is your friend. Accepts a hash with arbitrary key/value pairs. For example, I declare a few <code>God.watch</code> blocks, one for each value of an array (think &ldquo;worker 1 to 5&rdquo;), and I use <code>God::Watch#env</code> to pass the current value to the worker script. Works well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you do a <code>sudo god stop &lt;watch&gt;</code>, make sure to give it a few moments before running <code>sudo god start &lt;watch&gt;</code> again, or you might end up with orphaned unmonitored scripts running rampant in the background.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running <code>sudo god log</code> without any further arguments will tell you that &ldquo;You must specify a Task or Group name&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s actually a lie, as it only accepts task names. (A group is a number of related tasks. A task is a single monitoring watch.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, please: It might not look like it, but once I had figured it all out, I&rsquo;ve decided I actually like god. I like the feature set, it&rsquo;s really easy to set up, and it works. I&rsquo;m happy it exists.</p>

<h3 id="seven-things-weird-andor-unknown-about-me">Seven things weird and/or unknown about me:</h3>
<ol>
<li>When I was 8 years old, I&rsquo;ve developed an allergy to cats, more or less out of the blue. Which sucked, since I had two female cats at that time, Tina and Nena. (It was the 80s, gimme a break.) We had to give them away, and my room had to be renovated, as I became nearly asthmatic due to the omnipresent cat hair. Interestingly, becoming allergic to something you had no problems with before isn&rsquo;t all that uncommon. Still, not a nice experience.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m one quarter Polish. My granny was from Poland.</li>
<li>I have a drivers license for small tanks. I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to participate in the driving school while I was in the Army (90&rsquo;s), and went with it. :) So, I own a license for &ldquo;Klasse F (Voll- und Halbkettenfahrzeuge) — F2 (bis 30t)&rdquo; (up to 30 metric tons). I do not, however, own an actual tank, and quite frankly, I am not even sure whether I am allowed to steer a track-laying vehicle (like a tank) outside of the military now (regulations have changed quite a bit since then).</li>
<li>I had a pet rat when I was 14. My parents hated it. :)</li>
<li>The first computing device that was truly my own was an <a href="http://www.powerset.com/explore/semhtml/Atari_8-bit_family?query=Atari+800XL">Atari 800XL</a>. Awww yeah, bitches!</li>
<li>I own not five, but <em>six</em> pairs of original Bavarian <a href="http://www.powerset.com/explore/semhtml/Lederhosen">Lederhosen</a> in various lengths and styles. About 12 years ago, when I moved to Munich, I valiantly declared that I would <em>never ever</em> dress in Bavarian clothing as it just felt wrong. This, of course, led to me ending up with two pairs at my next birthday, as two circles of friends both had the same idea. Things developed from there. I came to like them, even though I <em>very</em> rarely wear them.</li>
<li>I tend to lie when asked by others to talk about things they might not know about me. A lot, actually.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="bonus">Bonus!</h3>
<ol>
<li>I once <a href="/2007/06/21/weissbier-with-timberlake/">met Justin Timberlake</a>. True story.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="id-like-to-thank-the-academy">I&rsquo;d like to thank the Academy</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to tag everyone who feels like participating in this <em>crazy</em> new meme. For example <a href="http://mikewest.org/">Mike</a> or <a href="http://hmans.net/">Hendrik</a>, who would both really surprise me would they take this thing and run with it.

			 <p>As mentioned earlier, Yahoo! decided to shut down its entire Munich engineering department. So since January 1st, I am officially out of a job.</p>
<p>What a downer… or is it?</p>
<p>After some deliberation and discussions with Dana, I&rsquo;ve decided to concentrate on the bright side: I have a few ideas for products (read: websites), and now I finally have the time to work on them. I&rsquo;ve always contemplated building them in my spare time while still being employed, but apart from a few
<a href="http://random.li/">small</a> <a href="http://twerpscan.com/">experiments</a> (which were fun to write but are hardly my personal &ldquo;next big thing&rdquo;) that concept didn&rsquo;t work out so well.</p>
<p>Thus, I&rsquo;ve decided to concentrate on my own stuff in 2009 — full frontal self-
employment. That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m an entrepreneur now.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I plan on spending about half a year to bring my ideas to life, and then taking on freelance jobs later on to bolster the income these site will
(hopefully) generate. My ideas are related to gaming, both because it&rsquo;s something I love and because I am definitely seeing a market there. I think my concept is sound, and I know I can build this …thing. It won&rsquo;t be easy, but I have no problems working for my money. ;)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether it will work out or not, but I want, nay, <em>need</em> to try.
The time certainly is as right as it gets. Actually, one could argue that I&rsquo;ve waited a bit too long with my idea, since a &ldquo;contender&rdquo; appeared on the scene a short time ago.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> But I don&rsquo;t see this as a showstopper, quite the contrary — <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Have_an_Enemy.php">it&rsquo;s good to have competition</a> as it keeps you on your toes. :)</p>
<p>So, 2009: it&rsquo;s going to be <em>my</em> year. It&rsquo;s a grand experiment, and while working alone I won&rsquo;t be alone, as my wonderful wife and my friends are supporting me. Still, I don&rsquo;t know yet whether I will succeed or if this kind of thing will be working for me. Quite honestly, this makes me a wee bit nervous.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, full steam ahead!</p>
<p>Yes I can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That said, these are gruesome times for publishing, and a lot of folks are not as well-positioned as I am. Imprints have vaporized, layoffs have begun,
and it’s better-than-even odds that a number of authors and books are going to get shaved off of publishing lists. 2009 is also likely to be a singularly lousy time to be an aspiring debut author, as publishing houses consolidate their lists and focus their resources on established avenues (i.e., spend their money on people who are already bestsellers) rather than seeking out new folks. Basically, life&rsquo;s gonna suck in publishing for the next year or possibly two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love my ebook reader (<a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/">Stanza on the iPod</a> as you can&rsquo;t get the Kindle here in Germany yet), and I&rsquo;d like to buy more ebooks. It&rsquo;s a distribution channel which (I think) would be a pretty good way for the publishers to make additional money …if many of these files wouldn&rsquo;t cost me as much or more than the dead-tree versions.</p>
<p>I mean, really: I like good novels as much as the next guy, and I am definitely willing to spend money on them. Also, I don&rsquo;t like hardcovers for the price tags (yes, I think $25 is a lot of money). One would think that a digital version would cost substantially less than the hardcover, but it’s not always the case. Case in point: <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook72256.htm">&ldquo;Zoe&rsquo;s Tale&rdquo; by John Scalzi</a>, currently on sale for $25 (ebook, FictionWise) and $17 (hardcover, Amazon).</p>
<p>I have no problems with paying $7 or $8 for an ebook, but anything over $10 is highway robbery.</p>
<p>Do not misunderstand me: yes, I am tempted to buy it, but I will fight the urge, because quite frankly, John&rsquo;s a great writer, and I enjoy his novels <em>very, very much</em>. Also, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s the one dictating the price — so who&rsquo;s responsible for these insane prices which seriously keep me from spending money?</p>
<p>(BTW: Yes, you might say <em>&ldquo;get the paperback&rdquo;</em>, but this is not my point. My point is: I <em>want</em> the digital edition, because it&rsquo;s the version I prefer for various reasons.)</p>
<p>Anyways, I believe right now the publishing industry is facing the same problems as the music industry — they’re shooting themselves in the foot because they are either ignoring the possibilities of using a great distribution channel or actively sabotaging it by asking for completely disproportionate amounts of money.</p>
<p>Angry Carlo is angry.</p>

			 <p>Yahoo! hat am Freitag verkündet, die gesamte Engineering-Abteilung in München zu schließen. Meine Freude war etwas gedämpft, bin ich doch (noch) Teil dieser Abteilung.</p>
<p>Meine Motivation, eine neue &ldquo;Herausforderung&rdquo; zu finden, stieg dementsprechend sprunghaft — denn ab 31.12.2008 bin ich somit ohne Arbeit (Stand: heute).</p>
<p>Um ehrlich zu sein, ich weiß noch nicht genau, was ich machen möchte. Will ich als Freelancer arbeiten? Suche ich mir einen (interessanten) neuen Job? Mache ich eine eigene Firma auf? Im Moment bin ich etwas unschlüssig, alle drei Optionen klingen irgendwie verlockend.</p>
<p>Vielleicht muss ich nur überzeugt werden. Also, sollte eine coole Firma in München zufällig nach einem versatilen Allrounder mit einem Faible für Scripting/Hacking (Ruby, Python, Javascript, Perl, PHP, LUA…) und alles Neue suchen, der sich mit geschlossenen Augen in diesem Internetz auskennt: ich würde mich <em>sehr</em> über <a href="mailto:carlo@zottmann.org">eine Mail</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/municode">einen Tweet</a> oder einen Anruf (089

oder <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Carlo_Zottmann">Xing-Profil</a>. :) Danke!</p>
<p>Und sollten irgendjemand nach einem wirklich sehr, sehr guten Web Dev suchen:
mein Freund und Kollege <a href="http://mikewest.org/">Mike West</a> ist zur Zeit <a href="http://mikewest.org/2008/11/mike-has-been-laid-off">ebenfalls auf der Suche</a>.</p>

			 <p>(This is a post in German. <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/2008/11/11/childs-play-2008-germany/">Are you looking for the English language version?</a>)</p>
<p><a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/"><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/11/cp160.gif" alt="" title="Child's Play ad"></a> <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play 2008</a> ist gestartet. Gamer in vielen Ländern geben Geld oder kaufen Spielzeuge, Games und andere Geschenke für Kinderkrankenhäuser und -stationen und ihre kleinen Patienten; Partner-
Kliniken in den US, Großbritannien, Kanada, Neuseeland, Australien und Ägypten freuen sich über vielen Spenden.</p>
<h3 id="die-frage">Die Frage</h3>
<p>Aber warum nicht hier in Deutschland? Die Frage kam mir während des Sommer immer wieder in den Kopf. Wieso gibt es keine deutschen Kliniken, die mit
<a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a> zusammenarbeiten? Im Juli fragte ich dann bei <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/contact.php">Kristin Lindsay</a>, der Projektmanagerin im Hause Penny Arcade, nach und bot präventiv meine Dienste als &ldquo;freiwilliger Verbindungsoffizier&rdquo; an.</p>
<p>Die Antwort kam nach ein paar Tagen: <em>&ldquo;Der Grund ist: Wir sprechen kein Deutsch, was die Kontaktaufnahme ziemlich erschwert. Dein Angebot nehmen wir gern an!&quot;</em></p>
<h3 id="die-aufgabe">Die Aufgabe</h3>
<p>Im Prinzip geht es nur darum, den initialen Kontakt zwischen <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a>
und interessierten Kliniken herzustellen. CP kennt keine deutschen Einrichtungen. Woher auch? Sie brauchen Gamer vor Ort, i.e. uns, wie in allen anderen Ländern auch. Die Verantwortlichen in den Krankenhäusern haben Fragen,
und es schafft mehr Vertrauen, wenn diese von lokalen Ansprechpartnern in Landessprache beantwortet werden.</p>
<p>Rechtlich gesehen sind die Freiwilligen außen vor. Wenn sich eine Einrichtung entschließt, ein sog. Partnerhospital zu werden, wird eine rechtliche Vereinbarung direkt zwischen ihr und der Charity in den USA geschlossen.
<a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a> arbeitet dabei aber nur mit sog. <em>non-profit organizations</em> zusammen: z.B. mit öffentlichen Kliniken oder auch entsprechenden Stiftungen.</p>
<p>Wir, die Freiwilligen, kommen erst wieder ins Spiel, wenn das Krankenhaus evtl. Hilfe beim Erstellen seines Wunschzettels benötigt. Der Kauf und die Lieferung erfolgt komplett über Amazon.</p>
<h3 id="die-geschichte">Die Geschichte</h3>
<p>Eine gute Woche später, Anfang August, war ich wegen einer Untersuchung als potentieller Knochenmarkspender im <a href="http://www.kh-neuperlach.de/">Klinikum München-Neuperlach</a>. Ich fragte mich zum Sozialdienst durch, wo ich erfuhr, dass Neuperlach keine Kinderstation hat. Knüller! Dafür bekam ich aber vom freundlichen Chef des Dienstes Namen und Telefonnummern von Ansprechpartnern in den Kliniken in München-Harlaching und München-Schwabing. Sehr gut!</p>
<p>Nun, ich hatte nicht wirklich erwartet, dass sich die Leute darum reissen,
mich anzuhören. Trotzdem begann ich frohen Mutes meinen Telefondienst. Meine zwei Kontakte waren freundlich und hilfreich, aber nicht die Personen, die Charities betreuen. Ich bekam immer neue Namen von anderen Klinik-
Mitarbeitern, die sich &ldquo;um derlei Anfragen&rdquo; kümmern, und nach einigen Umwegen hatte ich auch tatsächlich Menschen am Apparat, die mir zumindest Auskünfte und richtige Namen geben konnten. Nur half das nicht wirklich weiter: <em>&ldquo;Der Verantwortliche heisst [XYZ], aber er/sie ist krank/im Urlaub/auf Reisen&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>Die nächsten zwei Monate verbrachte ich dann viel, viel Zeit am Telefon. Ich sprach mit netten und ehrlich interessiert wirkenden Klinikmitarbeitern, die um Infomaterial baten und Fragen hatten. Bei einigen dieser Fragen musste ich bei Kristin Lindsay nachfragen, weil ich die Antworten selbst nicht kannte.
Aber hey, leben und lernen! :) Kristin half mir weiter, und ich gab die Informationen auf Deutsch an meine Kontakte in den Einrichtungen. Ich rief im Wochenrhythmus an, fragte nach Neuigkeiten und Entscheidungen. Aber Bürokratie braucht seine Zeit. Ich hakte nach… hakte nach… hakte nach.</p>
<p>Kurzgesagt, ich tat das, wofür ich als Freiwilliger &ldquo;angeheuert&rdquo; hatte.</p>
<h3 id="ende-erster-akt">Ende erster Akt</h3>
<p>Ende Oktober kam dann aber leider das Aus (für dieses Jahr). Die Städtischen Kliniken München ließen mich in einer kurzen Mail wissen, dass sie <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a> interessant fänden, ich aber bitte Verständnis dafür haben sollte,
dass man nicht Partnerhospital werden möchte. Schade.</p>
<p>Mir blieb nichts weiter übrig, als mich für die Info zu bedanken, und darauf hinzuweisen, dass 2008 sicherlich nicht das letzte CP-Jahr gewesen sein wird.</p>
<p>Tja, und das ist der Grund, warum es zumindest dieses Jahr keine <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a>-Aktionen in Deutschland gibt.</p>
<h3 id="die-nachbesprechung">Die Nachbesprechung</h3>
<p>Ich finde es bedauerlich, klar. Und im Nachhinein denke ich mir, dass ich eventuell mehr als nur zwei Kliniken hätte anschreiben müssen. Die Chancen auf einen Erfolg wären klar größer gewesen. Aber ich hatte so etwas noch nie gemacht, und hatte keine Ahnung, wieviel Aufwand auf mich zukommen würde. Ich wollte klein anfangen, und im nächsten Jahr darauf aufbauen. Nach oben hin ist schließlich immer alles offen; aber beim ersten Mal zu versuchen, 10 Kliniken gleichzeitig zu jonglieren, und dann zu versagen, Leute zu enttäuschen, den Ruf von <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a> aufs Spiel zu setzen &ndash; das erschien mir kein guter Ansatz.</p>
<h3 id="childs-play-2009">Child&rsquo;s Play 2009</h3>
<p>Nächstes Jahr werde ich früher anfangen, nach Krankenhäusern zu suchen. Und ich verändere meinen Ansatz: ich werde die Kliniksuche &ldquo;outsourcen&rdquo;. :)</p>
<p>Und zwar an Euch.</p>
<p>Kennt Ihr ein Kinderkrankenhaus oder eine Klinik mit pediatrischer Station,
das u.U. generelles Interesse an einer Zusammenarbeit mit <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a>
hat? Fragt bei der Klinikleitung oder beim Sozialdienst an &ndash; lasst sie wissen, dass es CP überhaupt gibt. Ich wage zu behaupten, dass die wenigsten Einrichtungen in Deutschland davon wissen. Wenn sie Interesse zeigen, habt Ihr drei Möglichkeiten:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ihr schickt sie direkt zu <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/contact.php">CP&rsquo;s Kristin Lindsay</a>.</li>
<li>Ihr gebt Ihnen <a href="mailto:carlo@zottmann.org">meine Kontaktdaten</a>.</li>
<li>Ihr kümmert Euch selbst darum. :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ich kann nichts versprechen, außer, dass ich jede Anfrage beantworten werde.</p>
<p>Mit etwas Glück wirds in 2009 ein größerer Erfolg, und die Presse hat mal etwas Anderes zu vermelden als <em>&ldquo;OMG KILLARSPIELE&rdquo;</em>. :)</p>
<h3 id="das-kleingedruckte">Das Kleingedruckte</h3>
<p>Ich bin kein Mitarbeiter von Child&rsquo;s Play. Ich spreche nicht für die Organisation, und ich vertrete sie nicht. Ich bin lediglich ein freiwilliger Helfer, der sich auf eigene Faust und Kosten für <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a> in Deutschland stark macht. Alle Aussagen zu legalen Gegebenheiten wurden nach bestem Wissen und Gewissen gemacht, können aber trotzdem großer Unfug sein.</p>

			 <p>(Dies ist die englische Version <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/2008/11/11/childs-play-2008-deutschland/">eines ursprünglich deutschsprachigen Artikels.</a>)</p>
<p><a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/"><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/11/cp160.gif" alt="" title="Child's Play ad"></a> <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play 2008</a> is on. Gamers in many countries of the world give money or buy toys, games or other gifts for child hospitals and stations and their little patients; partner hospitals in the US, the UK,
Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Egypt are delighted about all the donations.</p>
<h3 id="the-question">The Question</h3>
<p>But where&rsquo;s Germany? This question popped up in my head more than once during the summer. Why aren&rsquo;t there any German hospitals participating in <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a>? In July, I&rsquo;ve asked <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/contact.php">Kristin Lindsay</a> (Penny Arcade&rsquo;s project manager) about this, and preventively offered my help as &ldquo;voluntary liason officer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Her answer arrived after a few days: <em>&ldquo;We currently have no partners there simply because none of us speak German. If you&rsquo;d like to help out to get your local facility involved, that would be fantastic!&quot;</em></p>
<h3 id="the-job">The Job</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, the volunteers are needed to make the initial contact between
<a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a> and potential partner hospitals. CP doesn&rsquo;t know about these local facilities. How should they? They need local gamers, i.e. us, just like in all the other countries. Die people in charge in these clinics have questions, and it helps building trust in the idea when there are local contacts answering these questions in the local language.</p>
<p>From a legal point of view, the volunteers are not really involved. When a facility decides to become a so-called partner hospital, then there&rsquo;ll be a legal agreement with the US charity itself. <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a> only works with so-called <em>non-profit organizations</em>, tho, this can be either the hospital directly, their volunteer guild or the hospital foundation, whichever is applicable.</p>
<p>We, the volunteers, come back into play later, if at all; for example when the clinic may require assistance in building a wish list. The business side of the charity, i.e. sales and shipping, is handled by Amazon.</p>
<h3 id="the-story">The Story</h3>
<p>About a week later, early August, I went to the <a href="http://www.kh-neuperlach.de/index_e.html/">hospital Munich Neuperlach</a>. After my appointment I&rsquo;ve asked around and found the social services office, where I was told that the clinic didn&rsquo;t have a pediatric station. Bummer! But the friendly head of the office gave me names and phone numbers of people in two other, applicable local hospitals, Munich Harlaching und Munich Schwabing. Excellent!</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t quite expect to see people falling over each other to hear my case. Nonetheless I started doing my rounds on the phone. My two contacts were friendly and helpful, but not the people responsible for dealing with charities. Over and over I was given new names of other clinic personnel which would take care of &ldquo;requests like yours&rdquo;, and after a few detours I&rsquo;ve ended up talking to people who at least could give me some information and the right names. It just didn&rsquo;t really help right away: <em>&ldquo;The person you want to talk to is [XYZ], but he/she is sick/on vacation/on a business trip&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>During the next two months I&rsquo;ve spent <em>a lot</em> of time on the phone. I&rsquo;ve talked with nice hospital employees who appeared to be seriously interested,
who asked for more information. Some of them had questions I couldn&rsquo;t answer;
luckily there was Kristin Lindsay. :) I&rsquo;ve relayed Kristin&rsquo;s answers in German to my contacts. I&rsquo;ve called them on a weekly basis, asked for news and whether a decision had been made yet. But bureaucracy being what it is, this took some time, so I&rsquo;ve called them again… and again… and again.</p>
<p>In short, I&rsquo;ve done what I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;signed up for&rdquo; when asking whether they would need a local volunteer.</p>
<h3 id="end-of-season-one">End of Season One</h3>
<p>But then, end of October, all of a sudden it was over (at least for this run).
The administration of the Munich Municipal Hospitals told me in a short mail that while they found <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a> to be an interesting charity, they&rsquo;ve ultimately decided against participating. A pity.</p>
<p>In the end there was nothing left to do for me but to thank them for the notice, and reminding them that 2008 very likely isn&rsquo;t going to be the last year of CP.</p>
<p>Well, and that is the reason why there are no <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a> hospitals in Germany in 2008.</p>
<h3 id="debriefing">Debriefing</h3>
<p>Personally, I think it&rsquo;s a sad outcome, yes. I ponder whether I should&rsquo;ve contacted more than just two clinics. The chances for success would&rsquo;ve been much higher, of course. But this was the first time I&rsquo;ve done something like this, and I had no idea what to expect or how much work it would entail. I figured I&rsquo;d rather start out small, and increase the numbers in the next year.
The sky&rsquo;s the limit, sure; but trying to deal with 10 facilities at once in the first run, and running the risk of failure, of letting people down, of screwing with the reputation of <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a> &ndash; that didn&rsquo;t look like a solid plan.</p>
<h3 id="childs-play-2009">Child&rsquo;s Play 2009</h3>
<p>Next year I&rsquo;m going to start out earlier in the year. Also, I&rsquo;ve decided to change my approach: I&rsquo;ll &ldquo;outsource&rdquo; the search for applicable and interested hospitals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll outsource them to you.</p>
<p>Do you know a German children&rsquo;s hospital or a clinic with a pediatric station which might be interested in a contact to <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a>? Just ask the administration or the social services people &ndash; just tell them about CP. If I had to venture a guess, I&rsquo;d say most clinics in Germany have no idea the charity exists. If they&rsquo;re showing interest, you&rsquo;ll have three options:</p>
<ul>
<li>You send them to <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/contact.php">CP&rsquo;s Kristin Lindsay</a>.</li>
<li>You give them <a href="mailto:carlo@zottmann.org">my contact data</a> if they want to talk to a German.</li>
<li>You handle them yourself. :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please keep in mind that I can&rsquo;t promise anything, except that I&rsquo;ll answer each request.</p>
<p>And with a bit of luck we&rsquo;ll have more success in 2009, so the press might talk about something else than <em>&ldquo;OMG MURDAR SIMULATOR GAMSE&rdquo;</em>. :)</p>
<h3 id="the-fineprint">The Fineprint</h3>
<p>I am not affiliated with Child&rsquo;s Play. I do not speak for the organisation,
and I am not their representative. All I am is a freelance volunteer who thinks the idea of having <a href="http://childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a> partner hospitals in Germany is a really neat one. All statements regarding legal conditions and practices have been made to the best of my knowledge, but still they might be poppycock.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few weeks ago I was talking with <a href="http://mikewest.org/">Mike</a> about carefully choosing gifts for our loved ones, about how to select the right things for the right people,
so that come holiday season joy would be brought to them. We were discussing this arduous task at great lengths, using big words and long sentences,
reflecting the importance of the outcome and the process itself.</p>
<p>I believe our conversation started when the phrase <em>&ldquo;I need some random Christmas crap&rdquo;</em> was muttered by one of us.</p>
<p>So obviously, I am not the only person having this particular problem. I am part of a larger group. But this knowledge is no real consolation. What to get family and friends to show them our affection? Each year the same questions arises, like a clockwork, and each year we&rsquo;re more or less at a loss.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I wish there was a way to simulate long browsing sessions in a mall in a very very <em>very</em> condensed way, to allow for picking out gifts &ndash; while at the same time taking my very high-importance, hectic lifestyle into account. Oh, and if there was some soothing music, favorably some sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_listening">Easy Listening</a>, to sweeten the experience, that&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>As it turns out, I had to build this <em>simulation</em> myself. I&rsquo;ve decided to call it <a href="http://random.li/">random.li</a>, which, incidentally, also happens to be its domain! (I know, what are the chances?!)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="http://random.li/"><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/11/randomli.png" alt="Screenshot of http://random.li/." title="random.li"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://random.li/">random.li</a> grabs a number of different items from your favourite Amazon store, in your selected price range, shuffles them, and shows them to you in a 3x3 grid, along with the prices. You won&rsquo;t even see their titles!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about fast-paced, crack S.W.A.T. team-style gift finding. Shiny?
Check! Affordable? Check! Bag it, we&rsquo;re done!</p>
<p>Clicking an item (or hitting the related keyboard shortcut) will bring up some details: its title, what it is etc. A click on the details display will open its Amazon page in a new window.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all rather simple, and I&rsquo;ve tried to keep the amount of clutter low (yes,
the music player in the lower left corner is an essential for me). There&rsquo;s no registration, no wishlist, no shopping list, no learning curve to speak of. Go there, pick a store, your price range, maybe finetune the categories to search in, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="http://random.li/">have a look</a> if you&rsquo;re in the market for gifts. Maybe it&rsquo;ll work for you as it works for me! Comments are welcome, and I&rsquo;ve also set up a
<a href="http://friendfeed.com/rooms/randomli">FriendFeed room for support issues</a>.</p>
<p>If you like it, feel free to use the handy &ldquo;Bookmark&rdquo; button at the bottom of the <a href="http://random.li/">random.li</a> site to post the link to your favourite bookmarking /
social networking / web 2.0 site, like delicious, Digg, Facebook, Twitter and whathaveyou. I might even send you a cookie if you do!</p>
<p>Cheers! :D</p>

			 <p>During the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve built a couple of pipes I want to share.
(&ldquo;Pipe&rdquo;, in this context, means an application built in <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Pipes</a>.)</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2007/02/logo-lg.gif" alt="" title="Yahoo! Pipes logo"> Here&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<h3 id="your-most-recent-nike-run">Your Most Recent Nike+ Run</h3>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/tag/running.html">once or twice in the past</a>, I&rsquo;ve become a more or less avid runner during the last year. One central piece of my equipment is my
<a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/2008/05/04/still-running-april-2008/">Nike+</a>. I don&rsquo;t run without it. I am a geek, I love numbers. The Nike+
provides me with numbers. It makes running a game.</p>
<p>I sync my iPod with my iTunes after each run, and the <a href="http://nikeplus.nike.com">Nike site</a> is taking the raw data, crunching it, giving me graphs and more numbers, and (this is the interesting thing) badges for my website.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t really care about those. But when there are badges, there must be an API which provides the raw data to them. Looking behind the scenes, I quickly found it. It&rsquo;s not password-protected or secured in any way; when you set your nikeplus.nike.com profile to &ldquo;public&rdquo;, the API will return some of your data (run overviews, run details etc. &ndash; no personal details).</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/05/nikeplus.png" alt="" title="Nike+ package"> So, knowing the API URL, I&rsquo;ve built a pipe which will do a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accept any nikeplus.nike.com &ldquo;brag&rdquo;-type of link as parameter (when you&rsquo;re logged in to the site, these are usually labelled &ldquo;Share with your friends&rdquo;, &ldquo;Grab the link&rdquo; etc.).</li>
<li>It will extract your public, numeric runner ID from this link.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;ll fetch the data for the most recent run of the runner with this ID, i.e. you.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;ll build an RSS feed with the data of your most recent run.</li>
</ol>
<p>When writing the pipe, I&rsquo;ve made a few assumptions, namely that…</p>
<ul>
<li>you sync your iPod after each run</li>
<li>you&rsquo;re using the Nike+ site</li>
<li>you don&rsquo;t run more than once per day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I am lazy, I&rsquo;ll only use the data for the most recent run, so the pipe&rsquo;s results will be exactly that &ndash; just a single item, your most recent run.</p>
<p>That being said, I found this sufficient. After adding the pipe&rsquo;s RSS URL as new &ldquo;Custom RSS&rdquo;-type service to Friendfeed, FF will effectively trigger the pipe a few times each day, and your latest run will be added to your stream quickly. Next time you sync your iPod, the Nike site will pick up the new data, the API will return the new data to the pipe, and the new run will be added as new Friendfeed item.</p>
<p>The pipe will post your runs in the following format: &ldquo;<em>[Nike+ runner name]</em> ran <em>[distance]</em> <em>[km/mi]</em> in <em>[time]</em>&rdquo;, for example &ldquo;3R ran 11.3543 km in 1:03'54&quot;&rdquo;. The message will link to the public page of the run &ndash; a page <a href="http://nikeplus.nike.com/nikeplus/?l=runners,runs,2028425749,runID,1278781372">like this</a>. (3R is my Nike+ moniker.)</p>
<p>Now, why would I want to add my runs to Friendfeed? Well, why not? For me,
running is a nice part of my life. I&rsquo;m actually enjoying it, I&rsquo;m keeping it casual, and I am proud of every damn kilometer mark I pass. Plus, as mentioned, I am a geek, and I like to share what I build. :)</p>
<p>If you have questions or suggestions, speak your mind in the comments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yahoo! Pipes: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/czottmann/nikeplus_recent_run">Recent Nike+ Run</a></li>
<li>Friendfeed: <a href="http://friendfeed.com/carlo?service=feed&amp;serviceid=5f91145ba81e45fcab7b692c201e3a04">the result &ndash; my Nike+ runs as added service.</a></li>

			 <hr>
<p>(This is a rather long piece. It has a point, though… so please bear with me.
Danke.)</p>
<p>During the last couple of months I&rsquo;ve developed an increasing interest in the US elections. More or less closely following the news about them, scrutinizing and evaluating their talking points and ideas, I&rsquo;ve become rather familiar with both candidates, formed an opinion &ndash; slowly realizing that I am actually more interested in the politics of a country I don&rsquo;t live in and an electorate system I can neither influence nor participate in than in my own nation&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Allow me to elaborate how I came to care about domestic US politics.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, on a sunny day in September, I was sitting in my office working, when a friend pinged me and told me to turn on the TV, <em>now</em>. A few fanatics had hijacked several passenger planes, using them as weapons. We sat in front of the screen, staring in horror at the looped footage, and couldn&rsquo;t believe our eyes. I remember very clearly turning to my coworkers, telling them that it was very likely we were witnessing the first day of World War III; someone had just attacked one of the most gung-ho empires of the World (no offense) &ndash; this was bound to have long-lasting repercussions. No-one would or could expect the USA to take this lying down. I was expecting to see the US military turning some small part of the globe into a glassed parking lot.</p>
<p>I remember this fear. It was a deep-seated worry for the World as a whole, as <em>meta</em> as this may sound.</p>
<p>I spent the next few months watching news from the United States very closely. The increase in domestic security, the preparations for the war, the passing of the Patriot Act &ndash; to me, the country resembled a wounded predator; maddened by pain, yet ready to throw itself against the ghostly attacker, lusting for the kill. Pretty much everything I heard in terms of news, speeches and sound bites, was not very rational.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, it scared the living shit out of me.</p>
<p>Trying my best to cope with this feeling of terror building up inside of me, I started to look for more reasonable voices from the &ldquo;inside&rdquo;. Surely all the hate mongering and Giuliani&rsquo;esque approaches to making statements<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> couldn&rsquo;t be the whole of it. Someone had to remember there is more to any issue than just black and white! But there was all this <em>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not with us, you&rsquo;re against us&rdquo;</em> madness coming from the US government, and it was not just freaking me out &ndash; I found it highly insulting to the rest of mankind, because it was clearly implying the other nations were either not sympathetic or not interested or just too stupid to come to their own conclusions.</p>
<p>So… There must be some voices of reason, no? Still shaken I started to dig deeper, ignoring the main media outlets, looking for something that could rejuvenate my opinion that not all of the USA had gone mad with pain.</p>
<p>To make it short: yes, I found them. Which was a great relief, because it gave me back my hope that logic and reason might prevail in the long run. I stuck to some of these newfound sources; I read a number of political blogs, for example, and I watch the fine offerings in political satire by your own Comedy Channel.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Fast forward to the 2004 US elections.</p>
<p>Well. We all know how that turned out. Speechless and highly disgusted I witnessed the shit slinging of the &ldquo;friends&rdquo; of the Republican candidate; the despicable and dishonorable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_Boat_Veterans_For_Truth">&ldquo;Swift Boat Veterans For Truth&rdquo;</a> campaign being just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>No matter what you may think about 2004 Democratic presidential candidate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry">John Kerry</a> &ndash; he was a man fighting for his country in a war he didn&rsquo;t start, apparently committing acts of bravery, saving his comrade&rsquo;s lives, and many people took a piss at that. The 2008 version of this would be claiming John McCain was merely taking a vacation back in Vietnam, or running a brothel in Hanoi &ndash; this would be wrong, both in a factual and moral sense, and the Republicans would hang you in the middle of the Washington Mall.</p>
<p>So, how could this happen?! How could this <em>possibly</em> work out for the Republican side?</p>
<p>Anyways… I&rsquo;ve already mentioned my disbelief and disgust. Still highly worried about the state of the Union.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Fast forward again: September 2008.</p>
<p>The last few years have been less than optimal for the World. I don&rsquo;t say all of it is the fault of the United States; far from it. But when you have one of the major players acts like he owns the place and gives a flying fuck about everyone else, it&rsquo;s bound to cause problems. (To be fair, many of the others aren&rsquo;t much better, tho.) I am very sure many things could have turned out better had more diplomatic, subtle and less arrogant paths been taken.</p>
<p>And the US is still scares me. The reason for my being afraid has changed, though. Since 2001, many things have been going down the drain, both inside and outside the country, fundamentalism is on the rise, and many people acting highly erratic.</p>
<p>If anything, the World is more complex now, yet the government of one of the most influential nations on this planet is busy trying to &ldquo;secure the borders&rdquo; and beating its chest, trying to intimidate other countries and ignoring global problems.</p>
<p>And they continue to claim the position of &ldquo;global leadership&rdquo; without actually leading.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>This time around, in the presidential race is between a 72 year old and a 47 year old man. Here&rsquo;s my rundown from the outside.</p>
<p>The former has a lot of experience in the inner workings of Washington, D.C., agrees with most things still-president Bush has said and done, and doesn&rsquo;t know how many houses he owns. I&rsquo;ve seen him in interviews a few years ago, and he seemed decent and honest enough. I liked the old John McCain better than the new &ldquo;100% P.O.W.!&rdquo; version; obviously his strategists have decided that having him retell his prison years over and over again is policy enough. Which I find a bit sad since it reduces his whole life and accomplishments to those 5 years in a Vietnam prison; on top of that, in the current context, it&rsquo;s just political fluff. He is very vague about what he&rsquo;s planning to do should he end up being elected. Topics like the fight against poverty (both domestic and global) and climate change are marginalized points of his campaign, at best.</p>
<p>The latter has not as much Washington experience, but spent a good amount of his years working for the disenfranchised, is a professor in constitutional law, and seems to rather spend his time talking with people and about actual issues (like fighting poverty or climate change), while refusing to return the slander thrown at him by his opponents.</p>
<p>And they are doing it again. They mock his work as community organizer, which in my book is something that you couldn&rsquo;t disagree with by any standards. It&rsquo;s basically one of the Christian virtues &ndash; <em>I</em> know that, and I am an agnostic. Why do these self-proclaimed Christians mock somebody for showing compassion? What is wrong with these people?</p>
<p>It pains me to witness hypocrisy on such a scale.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2018-11-obama-badge.jpg" alt="Obama &lsquo;08 badge"></p>
<p>So why do I, a German in Germany, root for Barack Obama?</p>
<p>Because the World is a closed system. While I don&rsquo;t believe in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_Effect">Butterfly Effect</a>, I strongly believe in setting a higher or lower standard for yourself and thereby giving others the idea to follow suit. Leading &ndash;or failing&ndash; by example. What works for small groups will work on a global level as well.</p>
<p><em>A change in leadership in any bigger country in the World will indirectly have an effect on me. This is why I care.</em> (Some issues are more important than others, of course.)</p>
<p>So I was very, very delighted to hear a presidential candidate of one of the biggest countries in the World stand up and say: <em>&ldquo;These are the problems. Denial doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. Listen, I have kids, so do you, so we&rsquo;ll better fix this shit for their sake &ndash; and here&rsquo;s a rather detailed plan.&quot;</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Yes, I feel strongly about the impending climate change. Everyone should. We are talking about man&rsquo;s homestead among the stars. This is our house. Our <em>only</em> house. If we burn this place down, then we&rsquo;re truly, really, utterly fucked. I am puzzled why anyone would hesitate talking or thinking about it, let alone working on preventing it or slowing it down. These people are delusional idiots.</p>
<p>Please take a minute to compare both <a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/newenergy">Obama&rsquo;s page on fighting climate change</a> and <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/climatechange/">McCain&rsquo;s page</a>. One is a finely formulated plan which gives the impressions people thought about and discussed it at length; the other is a rephrased version of <em>&ldquo;Someone should do something at some point in time …oh look, an adorable kitten&rdquo;</em> an intern was asked to put up so the number of 404 errors in the log files would go down.</p>
<p>(On a related note: let&rsquo;s assume Senator McCain actually believes in climate change and the need to do something about it &ndash; the man is still 72 years old. I wish him a long life, but statistically speaking, chances are much higher that he&rsquo;ll die a natural death within the next four years than someone who is 25 years younger. Should he die in office, we&rsquo;d <em>all</em> end up with an US president who doesn&rsquo;t believe in man-made climate change. That&rsquo;s basically what we have already.)</p>
<p>Now, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/home_en.htm">the European Union is working on fighting climate change</a>, too. Yes, <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/2007/06/07/madrid-or-why-were-all-doomed/">not all EU countries are good at it.</a> But I am proud to say <a href="http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_6516/Content/EN/Artikel/2007/08/2007-08-24-meseberg-klimaschutz__en.html">my government seems to care</a>. Still, the EU is just <em>one</em> major player, and a bit limited due to its internal structure. The more big players stop with the lip service and start actually working on it, the better.</p>
<p>So, to sum up:</p>
<p>There are two candidates in the current US presidential election cycle. I believe both are decent and honest men. It&rsquo;s just that one of them seems to care about the actual issues (both domestically and globally), appears to have the fundamental understanding of what&rsquo;s going on in the World, and the right mind set to actually get to work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Barack Obama is the second coming of Jesus. That thought is ridiculous. I think he&rsquo;s just a guy with the right ideas. I also think under his leadership the US would ask more of the EU, which is fine with me. I prefer a real, actual partnership over the <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re heading this way, just follow, suckers&rdquo;</em> methods of the past.</p>
<p>It is my belief that he (working with his VP) has the potential and tenacity to not only nudge the World in the right direction, but to restore the moral standing of the USA &ndash; and to have everyone calm down again. It is my belief that others will follow.</p>
<p>This is the 21st century. I&rsquo;d really see the US move forward again, for it would actually help the World as a whole.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an US citizen, come November, I&rsquo;d like to ask you to make a choice based on logic.</p>
<p>Please, keep the big picture in mind.</p>
<p>Please, do not get fooled by the sepia-tinted pictures of the good old, simpler, imaginary times in small town America.</p>
<p>Please, use your right to vote.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve become increasingly annoyed with my blog&rsquo;s design. It&rsquo;s …too much.
There&rsquo;s a sidebar, there&rsquo;s a tag cloud, there&rsquo;s the archives, there&rsquo;s whatnots and doodads and stuff. Funny; a few months ago I&rsquo;ve installed it to make the site more lightweight, and had the feeling I had succeeded. (Take a look at my still unchanged <a href="http://tumblr.zottmann.org/">tumblelog</a> to see the old design.)</p>
<p>Still, over the last few weeks I felt the urge to further strip it down.</p>
<p>Is less more? Well… I think so. Less clutter, less noise, less fluff. (At least outside the blog posts.) Let&rsquo;s focus on the actual meat! If there is any.</p>
<p>Plus I&rsquo;ve tried to read one of my posts using the highly useful
<a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> application on my iPod touch, in its text mode, and got seriously annoyed. So much crap to scroll through just to get to the actual article &ndash; archive, tag cloud, about blurb etc.</p>
<p>This warranted a change.</p>
<p>So, taking a lot of inspiration and hints of <a href="http://www.bigcontrarian.com/">Jack Shedd</a> and <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/">Ryan Tomayko</a> &ndash; read: fusing their wonderful respective designs into a freaky bastard child &ndash; I&rsquo;ve managed to come up with a light and mostly clutter-free layout that&rsquo;s both easy on the eyes and pleasing <a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>&rsquo;s text mode<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve removed everything I&rsquo;ve deemed unnecessary. Like the sidebar, the external links, the archive, the list of tags, the blurbs, the doodads and whatnots. The article display has been cleaned up and I&rsquo;ve removed the

			 <p>In his thoroughly enjoyable <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1233416?shelf=series--science-in-the-capitol"><em>Science In The Capitol</em> trilogy</a>, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1858.Kim_Stanley_Robinson">Kim Stanley Robinson</a> (who happens to be my favourite author) talks about a concept called &ldquo;The Paleolithic Life&rdquo;; something he also spoke about in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-jz86gMiHw">Google Tech Talk on Climate Change</a> (at ~50min in).</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/51035555243@N01/287666827" title="A Brand New Day"><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2020/8a09065919.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The idea is that there are certain activities engraved in the mind of every human, which result in joy and happiness. These are the things the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic">paleolithic</a> man did during his waking hours, things nature rewarded him for by making him feel alive and capable and <em>good</em>, thus helping him evolve and aiding his development.</p>
<p>Mr. Robinson compiled a list of these activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spending the day outdoors</li>
<li>Walking and running</li>
<li>Looking for things</li>
<li>Making things</li>
<li>Throwing rocks</li>
<li>Cooking and eating</li>
<li>Talking and listening</li>
<li>Singing and music</li>
<li>Dancing and sex</li>
<li>Finding a mate</li>
<li>Raising kids</li>
<li>Looking at fire</li>
<li>Seeing by moonlight</li>
<li>Killing animals</li>
<li>Being killed by animals</li>
<li>Making beds at night</li>
<li>Exploring new land</li>
<li>Feeling emotions, including terror, religion, right and wrong, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Especially when you spend your waking hours in an office job, most of these activities are not part of your life anymore. We do not need to hunt for food anymore, we&rsquo;re seldom being killed by animals<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, we don&rsquo;t throw rocks. But the engraved patterns, the subconcious memories of our ancestors life in the paleolithic, the biochemical reward mechanisms are still within us &ndash; just unused.</p>
<p>What a waste.</p>
<p>Having doubts about this? Here are some quick tests: If you have the chance, find a fireplace in the night and stare at the flames for a while. Or get out at night, take a walk by moonlight. Or meet with friends for self-made dinner. Or have good sex. (Or all of the above, at once.)</p>
<p>KSR&rsquo;s proposal is picking up our old habits again, raking in the old rewards, in order to lead a happier life. In a slightly modernised form, of course. Throwing rocks is <em>awesome</em> &ndash; until someone is crying, that is. Which should be avoided. So, how about Frisbee or Baseball? You throw things at things, with less chance of killing people by accident! And think about walking, running, building things <em>with your own hands</em>…</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/96332550@N00/478332550" title="Sunrise Paddling on the North Canadian River"><img src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/199/478332550_9d533b6c19_m.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Intriguing, no?</p>
<p>(His theory doesn&rsquo;t seem to be entirely fresh or new, tho; I think it has influenced some of the storylines in his wonderful <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1233416?shelf=series-mars"><em>Mars</em> books</a>, even though it was not specifically mentioned (it was in the aforementioned <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1233416?shelf=series-science-in-the-capitol"><em>Science In The Capitol</em> books</a>). Some of the characters find some inner peace when doing more or less mundane tasks; Nirgal just wanted to run<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, Nadia was happiest when she could build and make, John was at the top of his world when he could talk with and listen to people, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>So, long story short, I&rsquo;m trying to get a bit more paleolithic in my life.</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned, I have <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/tag/running.html">started running in April</a>, and it&rsquo;s actually pretty cool. I feel <em>really</em> good after most of my runs (not during them, mind you) &ndash; my new-found ability to run 5km straight is nothing short of a miracle to me, really.</p>
<p>Since I don&rsquo;t feel like hitting and paying for other peoples' stuff, but want to throw things at things, I bought some Frisbees and already took them out for some hilarious practice games with Dana, we had a blast, and I will try to make it a regular activity. I actually want to give casual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_Golf">Disc Golf</a> a try; we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Already I try to spend (a little bit) more time outdoors, mostly by walking instead of taking the bus, watching my surroundings, i.e. walking with open eyes. Good for the health, and sometimes you&rsquo;ll see interesting things, really. And next week I&rsquo;ll go kayaking. Gonna be interesting.</p>
<p>And I will try not to be eaten by wild animals.</p>
<p>Opinions?</p>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The feeling of successfully outrunning/outsmarting a predator was where the reward and joy lay, KSR mentioned in his Google Tech Talk.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Quite honestly, the figure of Nirgal, especially his recurring wish to &ldquo;just run&rdquo; deeply resonated with me. I&rsquo;d even say he was one of the big influences that <em>made me</em> pick up running. Don&rsquo;t laugh, please. Interestingly enough, <em>Science In The Capitol</em>&rsquo;s Frank Vanderwal&rsquo;s excursions into &ldquo;running frisbee golf&rdquo; read so good, it made me order two discs. :P&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			<h1><a href="https://zottmann.org/2008/07/17/020000.html">SearchMonkey Apps Palooza</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://zottmann.org/2008/07/17/020000.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2008-07-17 02:00:00 &#43;0200">Jul 17, 2008</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A couple of weeks ago (mid-June) I’ve participated in our internal <a href="http://yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a>
EU Hack Day. This time around I’ve decided to tinker with <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/searchmonkey/">Yahoo!
SearchMonkey</a> by building a couple of modules (dubbed SearchMonkey apps)
during the 24 hours available.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/07/sm_logo.png" alt="" title="Yahoo! SearchMonkey logo">In case you have never heard about SearchMonkey: it’s a technology built into <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Search</a> that allows developers to present their own or other peoples’ sites in a different way (examples to follow). These search result augmentations are dubbed “SearchMonkey apps”.</p>
<p>The Search users then have the option to use the SearchMonkey apps they like,
which enhances their search results by presenting them in a different way;
review sites for example might present their articles in a way that includes the rating or verdict of the reviewed item. There is a good number of different apps available at the <a href="http://gallery.search.yahoo.com/">SearchMonkey Apps Gallery</a>.</p>
<p>Using SearchMonkey doesn’t influence the ranking or the order of the results;
it displays the results in the same order, just differently.</p>
<p>Anyways. I ended up writing 6 apps, and most of them I’d like to share. For more information about a particular app, just click the links. They’ll take you to the related Gallery listing, where you’ll have the option to enable the app for your searches.</p>
<h3 id="twitter-profiles6"><a href="http://gallery.search.yahoo.com/application?smid=PH3.s">Twitter Profiles</a></h3>
<p>Whenever a Twitter profile turns up in your search, you’ll get a bit more information about the person—number of followers, number of people followed,
name, bio, location, last tweet. like this:</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/07/image.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>By the way, it doesn’t query the Twitter API; instead it just grabs the HTML page and extracts the publicly available information.</p>
<p>Once you’ve <a href="http://gallery.search.yahoo.com/application?smid=PH3.s">visited the Gallery page and installed it</a>, try a <a href="http://uk.search.yahoo.com/search?p=twitter+carlo">Yahoo! UK example query</a> to see it in action.</p>
<p>(On a related note, there’s apparently <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-nmtCUeQzerRT5iQg31WF0v9VWB1iCQ--?cq=1&amp;p=74">another Twitter SearchMonkey app</a>,
but I couldn’t find the installation link to give it a try. Bart, the developer, does things in a more complex and probably more fail-safe way; in my defense, I wanted to keep it simple.)</p>
<h3 id="wikipedia-quick-lookup10"><a href="http://gallery.search.yahoo.com/application?smid=OZI.s">Wikipedia Quick Lookup</a></h3>
<p>If a Wikipedia article is found, the app will show you its first paragraph and, if available, a thumbnail of the first image. Also the category:</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/07/image-1.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Once you’ve <a href="http://gallery.search.yahoo.com/application?smid=OZI.s">visited the Gallery page and installed it</a>, try a <a href="http://uk.search.yahoo.com/search?p=wikipedia+castle+rock">Yahoo! UK example query</a> to see it in action.</p>
<h3 id="xing-profiles13"><a href="http://gallery.search.yahoo.com/application?smid=RjM.s">Xing Profiles</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://xing.com/">Xing</a> is a more Europe-centric <a href="http://linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> contender. It’s big in Germany. If a Xing person is found, the app shows the mugshot, the location,
the title and the industry. Unfortunately Xing doesn’t reveal the company on public profiles unless you’re logged in, which my SM app clearly is not.
Still:</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/07/image-2.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Once you’ve <a href="http://gallery.search.yahoo.com/application?smid=RjM.s">visited the Gallery page and installed it</a>, try a <a href="http://uk.search.yahoo.com/search?p=xing+carlo">Yahoo! UK example query</a> to see it in action.</p>
<h3 id="vox-profiles18"><a href="http://gallery.search.yahoo.com/application?smid=JH7.s">Vox Profiles</a></h3>
<p>In a desperate attempt to suck up to <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/">Anil Dash</a> (I kid) I’ve hacked together a module to show the profile of any Vox blogger when a related page is found:</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/07/image-3.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Once you’ve <a href="http://gallery.search.yahoo.com/application?smid=JH7.s">visited the Gallery page and installed it</a>, try a <a href="http://uk.search.yahoo.com/search?p=vox+carlo">Yahoo! UK example query</a> to see it in action.</p>
<h3 id="techcrunch--valleywag-summaries22"><a href="http://gallery.search.yahoo.com/application?smid=yzf.s">TechCrunch / Valleywag summaries</a></h3>
<p>Using cutting edge high tech web 3.0 algorithms straight out of Munich,
Germany, this module is able to extract the gist of any given Techcrunch or Valleywag article.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/07/image-4.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>I don’t like these sites very much. At least their Yahoo! coverage (which I am interested in, given <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/carlo/">my background</a>) is usually hysterical and often times sensationalist. DO. NOT. WANT.</p>
<p>Once you’ve <a href="http://gallery.search.yahoo.com/application?smid=yzf.s">visited the Gallery page and installed it</a>, try a <a href="http://uk.search.yahoo.com/search?p=%28valleywag+OR+techcrunch%29+leaving+yahoo">Yahoo! UK example query</a> to see it in action.</p>
<p>Well, that’s it. Maybe you like those, maybe not. :) If you’re interested in writing your own apps for <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/searchmonkey/">Yahoo! SearchMonkey</a> now, take a look at the official <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/searchmonkey/smguide/">Manual for SearchMonkey Developers and Publishers</a>! And if you’re now wondering what other applications might be out there, the <a href="http://gallery.search.yahoo.com/">Gallery is a good place to start</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE/DISCLAIMER:</strong> Even though I work for Yahoo! during the day, these are NOT official SearchMonkey apps by Yahoo!. You’re looking at personal stuff. Again, this post, as everything on this site and under this domain, is NOT YAHOO! BUSINESS. Thank you.</p>

			 <p>After two weeks of <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/2008/06/02/asphalt-is-bad-mmmmkay/">not being able to run without pain</a> I’m good again. I had to find a different route, but after poking around in Google Maps and the surrounding forest I’ve managed to come up with a enjoyable one. The slightly annoying part is that I have to walk ~900m before to get to my actual starting
(and end) point. Well, I consider it warming up. I’ve added the distance to my usual 5km, and thus I am now at 7km per run.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I’ve bought some <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Hand-Irons/dp/B000KP1QDK/">light weights for my hands</a>. They’re
~450g (1lb) each. Doesn’t sound much, but it’s noticable—now my upper body gets some minor workout as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/30047882@N00/1231478137" title="WWF Logo"><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2020/25478c9c51.jpg" alt=""></a>I’ve registered myself for the <a href="http://nikeplus.nike.com/nikeplus/humanrace/">Nike+ 10km Human Race</a> going down end of August. Going to run for the <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/">World Wildlife Fund</a>. There’s an official event here in Munich, actually! Unfortunately the whole 10km are over pavement, and I don’t want to risk injury again, so I’ll have to run a different route, I think.</p>
<p>Overall I am well on track towards my “250km in 2008” goal. I believe with my next run I’ll be hitting the 100 miles mark. We’ll see what the <a href="http://nikeplus.nike.com/">Nike+
site</a> is going to tell me. Which is still kind of crappy, by the way. They rather add new and useless features than fixing longstanding issues like the broken OSX widgets.</p>
<p>I’ve discovered <a href="http://www.runnerplus.com/">Runner+</a>, a site which aims to be Nike+ without the cruft,
I guess—but that whole social networking thing is not doing it for me. Also,
the data sync is done by either using their desktop widget (requiring the <a href="http://widgets.yahoo.com/">Y!
Widget Engine</a>) or manual upload of the XML files or an automated daily sync where I need to give them my Nike+ credentials. Quite frankly, neither method is doing it for me. Plus I don’t really like the site. It doesn’t click with me.</p>
<p>Other options? Yes, OSX software.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.downtownsoftwarehouse.com/software/RunnersLog/">Runner’s Log</a> is nice and rather simple, but not exactly what I am looking for. Runs are broken down into “laps”, which might be nice if you’re running actual laps, but I ain’t.</li>
<li>And then there’s <a href="http://www.trailrunnerx.com/">TrailRunner</a> for those who not only use a Nike+ but a GPS receiver and heartrate monitor and have a fully staffed lab crew with instruments running with them. So… that’s not me. In their defense, I believe the TrailRunner target audience is a bit more hardcore about their running, biking, hiking, inline-skating or skiing than I am. (Also I was seeing more error dialogs during my 15 minutes with TR than I have in any other software in the last 6 months combined. Probably some Nike+ sync issues.)</li>
</ul>
<p>So no help on that front. Too bad. If I wasn’t so lazy I’d probably would’ve hacked together something simple that’s making use of the Nike+ web badge APIs. Maybe the day will come, tho.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> I’ve set up a <a href="http://friendfeed.com/rooms/nikeplus">Nike+ FriendFeed room</a>. Nothing in there yet, but who knows, that might change.</p>

<ul>
<li>Running again! Avoiding tarmac, thank God there are many forest roads around. Using light weights on my hands now, too. Fun. The most interesting part of the down period was that I was actually missing my runs, and that I was looking forward to start running again. I think it’s official: I like it.</li>

<li><a href="http://friendfeed.com/carlo">Using FriendFeed now.</a> It’s not bad, really; then again, I mostly use it to have a single place where all my loose threads come together.

I’ve tried subscribing to the combined feed of all the people I’ve subscribed to on the site, but it’s like being fed by a firehose. Unusable, sorry.

			 <p>[<img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2020/4128dcd87a.jpg" alt="">][2]A week ago, during the day, my left lower back and leg started to hurt. Each step I made stung, and it didn’t get better. I couldn’t think of anything I had done; I didn’t fall, trip or twist my leg. I had just run in the morning.</p>
<p>On Thursday the pain was still there, so I’ve consulted a doctor. She told me to stop running on asphalt the pavement, because no matter how good the shoes,
the ground in itself is too hard, too solid, too inflexible. So what I’ve done, in effect, was messing with my joints and cramping up my muscles. I was given a shot and the task to find a better route for running, preferrably something like forest roads.</p>
<p>Splendid.</p>
<p>Anyways, it’s Monday now, I haven’t been able to run for a week by now, and this sucks. I’m sitting around, actually <em>craving</em> to log a few kilometers.
Which feels a bit weird because three months ago I didn’t even think about running.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>

<p>Vorgestern bin ich im Biergarten der Alten Messe zum Mittag. Der Biergarten ist nahezu leergefegt; die Mittagszeit ist eigentlich schon vorbei.</p>
<p>An der Ausgabe entscheide ich mich für Bratwurst mit Sauerkraut. Großer Teller, große Wurst, große Portion Sauerkraut. Lecker! Fix bezahlt und einen Tisch gesucht. Ein paar Meter weiter sitzt ein älterer Herr über einen Masskrug gebeugt; mit einem kurzen Nicken bestätigen wir uns gegenseitig unsere Existenz zu dieser Stunde, an diesem Ort.</p>
<p>Ich setze mich, reisse mein Senftütchen auf—und muss feststellen, dass ich versehentlich Mayonnaise<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> gegriffen habe. Mon dieu! Entschlossen stehe ich auf, gehe zur Ausgabe, nehme mir ein Senftütchen, drehe mich um…</p>
<p>…und sehe einen Raben auf meinem Teller sitzen.</p>
<p>Kurz nachgedacht: Nein, ich kann mich nicht entsinnen, den gekauft zu haben. Was geht da vor?!</p>
<p>Ich mache einen Schritt auf meinen Tisch zu. Zehn Meter trennen mich von meinem Ziel.</p>
<p>Der Rabe schaut mich an. Ich schaue den Raben an.</p>
<p><em>[Tumbleweed fliegt durchs Bild.]</em></p>
<p>Seine kleinen schwarzen Knopfaugen mustern mich.</p>
<p>Ich mache noch einen Schritt.</p>
<p>Der Rabe greift meine Wurst mit dem Schnabel und fliegt davon.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>WAS. ZUM. TEUFEL.</p>
<p>Ich bin dann zu meinem Tisch gegangen, hab die Fußspuren in meinem Sauerkraut begutachtet, mich auf- und danach wieder abgeregt, hab die Dame an der Kasse danach gefragt, wo ich den Rest meines Essens entsorgen kann, und ihr auf Nachfrage die letzten vier Minuten meines Lebens kurz zusammengefasst. Als ich auf ihr &ldquo;Ja, wollen&rsquo;s a naie Portion?&rdquo; hin antwortete, dass mein Budget für die Pause aufgebraucht sei, überlegte sie kurz, und gab mir trotzdem einen neuen Teller, aufs Haus. Das nenn ich mal Dienst am Kunden! Dafür gibts zwei Pluspunkte.</p>
<p>Ich denke, dies war meine bizarrste Mittagsgeschichte bisher. Verdammtes Rabenviech.</p>

			 <p>I ran my first continuous 5km today. My workouts are 5km+ already, but usually I follow a run-walk-run-walk-run routine (2km running, 500m walking, repeat).</p>
<p>This morning I just didn’t stop running until I was back home again, 25 minutes later, which means my “just keep going” pace is ~4:50 min/km.</p>
<p>Damn, I am proud of myself. Harr!</p>

			 <p>Remember the other day, <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/2008/05/01/twitter-twerp-scan-update-reputation/">when I told you about the user reputation features</a> in <a href="http://twerpscan.com/">Twerp Scan</a>? Yeah, good times.</p>
<p>Anyways, today I’ve cobbled together a <a href="http://twerpscan.com/greasemonkey/twitter_user_reputation.user.js">quick Greasemonkey script</a> to display the reputation and voting thumbs on Twitter user pages, right above the “About” portion in the sidebar. Like so:</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/05/picture-21.png" alt="Screenshot of the Greasemonkey-added TwerpScan.com user reputation thumbs" title="Screenshot of the Greasemonkey-added TwerpScan.com user reputation thumbs"></p>
<p>So this means that you can see on a glance whether someone is naughty or nice,
right on his or her user page. And you can vote right there, on the spot, if you feel like, and this will of course feed the same database as you rating your contacts in <a href="http://twerpscan.com/">Twerp Scan</a>.</p>
<p>Use <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> for Firefox or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/greasekit">GreaseKit</a> for Safari to <a href="http://twerpscan.com/greasemonkey/twitter_user_reputation.user.js">install the script</a>, and then visit <a href="http://twitter.com/municode">any Twitter user page</a>.</p>

		<a href="https://zottmann.org/2008/05/04/020000.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2008-05-04 02:00:00 &#43;0200">May 4, 2008</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yes, I am <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/2008/03/28/i-like-it-auto-suggestion/">still running</a>. I’ve gone through a whole month of running three or four times a week, had some ups and downs, but didn’t quit. Yay, go me. ;)
Here’s my April 2008 diary—I want to write it down, because I think that picking up running is one of my bigger achievements in recent years, mostly because it takes so much fricking energy to do it. :p</p>
<p>It still isn’t fun. At all. Yet I know it’s good for me and my health and will pay out in the long run (pun intended). Thus, I keep going.</p>
<h4 id="gear">Gear</h4>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/05/nikeplus.png" alt="Nike+ package" title="Nike+ package">I fell for the <a href="http://nikeplus.com/">Nike+ system</a>. It rocks. (See below.)
Plus I got better shoes—Nike Air Zoom Structure Triax+. Comfy, light, I really like them.</p>
<p>Also, I bought some simple and light pants for running an a similarly simple
“soft-shell” jacket. Makes a bit of a difference, as they keep me cooler than a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt.</p>
<h4 id="nike">Nike+</h4>
<p>What can I say: I am loving it.</p>
<p>In case you haven’t heard of it, it’s a little sensor sitting on or in your shoe, tracking the distance you’ve run or walked and your speed. The counterpart is a little dongle for your iPod nano, storing the data and displaying your progress. It offers several training modes (basic, distance,
speed…) and comes with little built-in people who tell you how well you are doing. For example, I tend to run 5km in the morning, and the friendly lass in my iPod will now periodically tell me about my progress. In return, I try to make her like me and keep going.</p>
<p>Also, if you sign up on <a href="http://nikeplus.com/">NikePlus.com</a>, your iPod will sync your progress on the site next time you connect it to your computer. And this is the real kicker—you get stats on your runs and overall progress reports, you can check out graphs on your distances and speeds, you can make the site set up training plans, set goals for a month or year, and so on. Hell, if you’re inclined to do so, you can even create or accept challenges for and from other runners all over the world. Plus you get badges for your website or blog if you feel like sharing. Pretty crazy.</p>
<p>Anyways, what I really like about the Nike+ is: <em>It makes running a game.</em> Before, I was just running. But since I am a geek, I crave for numbers. I want to know my progress, right here, right now. How far into the run am I? Will these 2km I’ve said I’ll run in one go never end? What’s my pace? Now I have all this information strapped to my upper arm, on the display of my iPod. It’s great.</p>
<p>And since I know now what I can do, since I have numbers I can work with,
since I can see real progress, since I am aware of what I’ve achieved, I now feel much more comfortable with setting goals for myself. My April goal was running 40km alltogether, and I’ve done that. In fact, I’ve done so well that I’ve decided to go for 60km in May. It might not sound like much, but for someone who didn’t do anything just 2 months ago it’s okay, I guess.</p>
<p>My overall goal for 2008 is 250km, by the way.</p>
<p>I think without the Nike+, I would’ve quit some time ago. And to give credit where it’s due, <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_144/3546-Master-Chief-in-Sneakers-Making-Life-Not-Suck">it’s all Russ Pitts’ fault, really.</a></p>
<h4 id="finding-your-pace">Finding Your Pace</h4>
<p>This is a big one. Thanks to <a href="http://podrunner.com/">Podrunner</a> I found out that my perfect running pace seems to be 142 steps per minute. I managed to run 2km in a go more than once. Unfortunately, there aren’t many constant 142 bpm music mixes available, so now I’m playing around with a recording of a metronome, the beat sans the music. We’ll see how that’ll work out. The upside is that I might finally end up hearing the birds chirping. ;)</p>
<p>And for the record, my 5km routine is usual split up in 1.5km running, 0.5km walking, 1.5km running, 0.5km walking, 1km running.</p>
<h4 id="nikepluscom-oddities">NikePlus.com Oddities</h4>
<p>Oh yes, <a href="http://nikeplus.com/">NikePlus.com</a>. I have a love/hate relationship with that site.
It’s pretty, but atrocious in some parts. Let me explain.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s a full-Flash site. Even the login form is in Flash. Well done, guys. I am so glad my password manager doesn’t work there, really.</li>
<li>The run graphs look different on EU and US site. Specifically, the “US graphs” are more detailed than the “EU graphs”. See this example, which are the two graphs for the exact same run (EU first, US second): <img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/05/nikepluscom_eu.png" alt="NikePlus.com run graph, EU version" title="NikePlus.com run graph, EU version"><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/05/nikepluscom_us.png" alt="NikePlus.com run graph, US version" title="NikePlus.com run graph, US version"> Eh.</li>
<li>They offer OSX widgets for progress, goals etc.! Great in theory, but these are all broken on Leopard for months by now, with no fix in sight. The users complain, noone really cares. I mean, really, who uses Leopard?!</li>
<li>Oh, and did I mention there are different OSX widgets, depending on whether you’re on an US or EU NikePlus.com site?</li>
<li>Also, there are website badges, little Flash doodads for your website or blog. Nice, and they mostly work. The “Last 5 Runs” HTML badge is only available from the US site, tho. WTF?</li>
<li>The site has a “Coach” section which can be used to set up training plans for you. Again, good in theory, but it seems to have problems w/ custom trainings &ndash; my Mon+Wed+Fri routine became Tue+Thu+Sat on reload. Not just once, no &ndash; every time.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="heres-to-running">Here’s to running!</h4>
<p>Shit, I actually seem to like it. How could that happen? Well, at least I have the feeling I am doing something for myself.</p>
<p>I guess there are worse things.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Another late night <a href="http://twerpscan.com/">Twerp Scan</a> coding session. I mean, why not? ;) So,
what’s new today?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User reputation:</strong> You know the people you’re following, right? If you like what they do, give them a thumbs up or down rating. (No registration necessary. Just click.)</li>
<li>Some <strong>more pagination options:</strong> If you want, you can see all your contacts at once now.</li>
<li>The <strong>table columns can be re-ordered</strong>. Want the verdict right next to the name? Click the column header, hold the mouse button and drag it over.</li>
<li>More vertical space. It’s a wide table, after all.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, the reputation is a big one. Up until now, there was no way (that I know of) that allowed for community-driven behaviour rating. Here’s the idea:
we can block the “bad guys” all we want, but if I’d block @buyinsurancelol,
you wouldn’t know. But now I can give the guy a “thumbs down” in Twerp Scan,
and if you have him in your contact list, <em>you will see</em> he’s got a thumbs down.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if a 100 people think <a href="http://twitter.com/mybloglog">@MyBlogLog</a> is an okay guy (he is) and give his Twerp Scan contact list entry a “thumbs up”, you’ll see it in your contact list (on Twerp Scan)—which might convince you his 1:7 ratio and his following 15k other people are okay.</p>
<p>Well, at least that’s the idea. It’s a community-driven experiment. So consider playing around with it for the betterment of interwebs! Since it’s a pluggable system I think there are other possibilities… For example a Greasemonkey script that adds the reputation thumbs to the actual Twitter pages etc. Let’s brainstorm. The comments are open.</p>
<p>Well, that’s it. <a href="http://twerpscan.com/">Head on over to Twerp Scan to check out the new features.</a> And please let me know what you think, either via Twitter or the comments below.</p>
<p>(By the way, big thanks to the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a> team, the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Pipes</a> and <a href="http://js-kit.com">JS-

			 <p>Evening, y’all. I’ve been working a bit on <a href="http://twerpscan.com/">Twitter Twerp Scan</a>. Here’s what’s new:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be <strong>much faster</strong> now, due to changes in the processing logic. Up until now, the table was rendered, and then updated once for every scanned follower. Highly inefficient. Now the data is fully loaded before the table is rendered, which helps (at least my) processors to not go up in flames anymore. Let me know how it works for you.</li>
<li>There’s a nice loading indicator now, and a readable countdown! This is the best day of my life.</li>
<li><strong>Table pagination</strong> should help readability: by default, the table is now chopped into bite-sized 25 rows per page. There’s a handy little dropdown where you can change this setting.</li>
<li>Bugfix: Not broken in Flock anymore.</li>
<li>Bugfix: countdown accuracy.</li>
<li>Again, there’s a Twitter account for the <em>highly exciting</em> TS minutiae now, <a href="http://twitter.com/twerpscan">@twerpscan</a>. You might want to keep an eye on that one if you’re interested in the service.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://twerpscan.com/">Twerp Scan</a> received a good amount of hits over the last few days, mainly due to <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2008/04/27/twitter-twerp-scan-block-twitter-spammers/">a post on Download Squad</a>. Honestly, I am a bit surprised about this, but I won’t complain. Nice to see my little experiment is filling a niché for some people. :)</p>
<p>Let me know what you think of the new features. I have more things on my todo list, but my day only has so many hours (and I have a day job).</p>
<p>Good night!</p>

			 <p>Over the last few days I’ve pursued my idea to build a “Twitter spammer detector” of sorts using only client-side technologies. I didn’t feel like setting up server components at all.</p>
<p>What was it supposed to do? It should check the number of followers of everyone on your contact list, the number of people they are following, and the ratio between those. If the person is following more than 1000 people (can be customised), and has a Following-to-Followers ratio higher than 1:1 (can be customised), you’d be informed (by a handy “Block” link).</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Pipes</a>, the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI libraries</a> and the <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> API returning JSON, I was able to finish the first version of <a href="http://twerpscan.com/">Twitter Twerp Scan</a> in a relatively short period of time.</p>
<p>My Javascript-fu is still a bit weak, but getting better. It’s a nice change to only have one local file to work with (excluding CSS, of course).</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the traffic to that page increased quite a bit, mostly because <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2008/04/27/twitter-twerp-scan-block-twitter-spammers/">several</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/leolaporte">people</a> liked the idea enough to link the site.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve set up a Twitter account for service updates etc. &ndash; <a href="http://twitter.com/twerpscan">twerpscan</a>. The rest of my tweets will go to <a href="http://twitter.com/municode">Carlo</a> as usual.</p>

I’ve managed to finish the first four runs without breaking down, getting hit by a car, having to cry, falling or getting lost; and without dropping a single run.</p>
<p>I’m kind of proud of myself.</p>
<p>Using an unnamed maps site, I’ve laid out a nice 4.5km route in the neighbourhood. My first route was only 3.75km, which turned out to be too short. I got home while <a href="http://www.djsteveboy.com/intervals.html">the music</a> was still playing… unacceptable. So,
back to the drawing board, add a few streets, great.</p>
<p>I still don’t like it. The second half of each go is nice, tho… because I know I’m about to get home.</p>
<p>Nevermind, I’ll keep on doing it. Can’t hurt, and it makes me feel better.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I can’t really remember the other few sites where I’ve seen this, but
<a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/">Ma.gnolia’s</a> newly <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/blog/2008/04/03/on-our-new-front-doors">added OpenID support</a> is a good example on how not to implement OpenID.</p>
<p>So I go there to register an account, and sure enough, I find an OpenID form.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/04/picture-3.png" alt="Ma.gnolia OpenID form #1"></p>
<p>I click the button, allow Ma.gnolia to use my ID, and end up here:</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/04/picture-1.png" alt="Ma.gnolia OpenID form #2"></p>
<p>Umm, yeah… but no. I used my OpenID so I <em>do not</em> have to think about new usernames. I believe that asking me to come up with an unique username completely defies the concept of OpenID. Using OpenID in this form is like having a story line in a porn movie. Sure, you can boast that your movie has a plot, but who cares? It’s still just a smutty flick.</p>
<p>Somehow I think that one of us two isn’t completely understanding the concept of OpenID. Is it me?</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: I am not discussing the overall quality of Ma.gnolia here. I don’t use it. Others do and seem to like it, so I have no opinion in that regard.)</p>

			 <p>After <a href="http://twitter.com/municode/statuses/778038648">much deliberation</a> I’ve decided to give running another shot. No, not the short <em>&ldquo;omg the bus is leaving!!1&rdquo;</em> burst-kind of running (I do that rather often), but the type where you excercise three days a week for half an hour or so.</p>
<p>Since I usually don’t come home before nightfall I will go with the morning routines. But I don’t want my work day schedule to change, so I’ll just get out of bed ~45 minutes earlier. At least that’s the plan.</p>
<p>So today I got up at 6:30, brushed my teeth, had a glass of water, got into my clothes, put on the headphones and started running to the music.</p>
<p>Here’s my setup:</p>
<p><strong>Clothing:</strong> I don’t have any pants for sport or excercises. There, I’ve said it. My name is Carlo and I don’t &ldquo;do&rdquo; sport. Well. Thinking it through, I came to the following conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t know whether I will stick with it or not (I’ll try to, tho).</li>
<li>I don’t like to look like a confused scuba diver with sunglasses – no black spandex.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was afraid my amazing efficiently working subconciousness would manage to get me lost in finding the right clothes, effectively foiling my feeble attempts at doing <em>something</em>. Thus, I just donned an old pair of jeans, a longsleeve shirt, a down vest and sneakers.</p>
<p>Now imagine my surprise—I was able to exercise without spending shitloads of money on &ldquo;Pro athlete&rdquo;-themed sportswear. I believe the other jogging enthusiasts I’ve met probably think I am a madman.</p>
<p>Hi, I’m Carlo, rebel rookie runner. How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Music:</strong> I’m currently making use of <a href="http://www.djsteveboy.com/intervals.html">Podrunner Intervals</a>, a free podcast for running exercises. Check it out, it’s pretty sweet, even tho the parts for running are a wee bit to slow for my taste. I’m almost 2m tall, maybe my legs are too long. ;) But I’ll cope.</p>
<p>The single episodes are between 20 and 30 minutes long, and consist of a mix of slower and faster tracks. It’s a good mixture. Each week’s episode is going to push you a bit harder, until after 9 weeks you <em>should</em> be able to run 5 km in one go. We’ll see how that’ll work out.</p>
<p><strong>The first run:</strong> Good! I’ve been moving for ~30 minutes. In the end I was sweating profusely but didn’t feel like killing myself, which is a big plus. Still, it wasn’t fun. Sport, for me, simply isn’t fun. At all. That said, the <em>&ldquo;I’ve done something for my body!&quot;</em> feeling afterwards <em>is</em> nice. :)</p>
<p>So, the sole reason I’m writing this is to keep myself from giving up prematurely. Looming shame is a powerful weapon, and this post shall be my reminder it might hit me shouldn’t I suck it up.</p>

			 <p>Evening, y’all. This is <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/">Carlo</a>, your friendly <a href="http://planetyahoo.zottmann.org/">Planet Yahoo!</a>
maintainer, with a quick note.</p>
<p>A few hours ago I’ve updated the <a href="http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/">engine</a> that aggregates all the different
<a href="http://yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> blogs into the big purple blob that is Planet Yahoo!. Said update adds better ordering of the blog entries, and the feed parsing should be more solid. Most changes are under the hood, so nothing too interesting for the end user, i.e. you.</p>
<p>And it’s the same as with any update: while I don’t think there’ll be problems, it might turn out I was wrong. Heh.</p>
<p>One minor issue: the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PlanetYahoo">syndication feed</a> will be marked as “fully updated”;
so a number of older entries that you’ve already marked read in your newsreader might pop up as unread again. Not to worry, this will only happen once.</p>
<p>The good news is that in the process I’ve decided to spend some time to build a better (pardon the audacity), yet unofficial feed for the <a href="http://research.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!
Research</a> site. Also, I’ve updated the <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/community/planetyahoo/">MyBlogLog</a> badge, even though I know that most of the readers never visit the site, but just subscribe to the feed.</p>
<p>And that’s it for today about PY!. Cheers! -C.</p>
<p>PS: The rest of my wacky daily adventures is currently been prepared for a multi-part TV treatment over at <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/">my blog</a>. But you might know that already.</p>

			 <p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/03/masseffect_02_745x440-2.jpg" alt="Promotional Mass Effect screenshot, &ldquo;Bring Down the Sky&rdquo;"></p>
<p>This afternoon I’ve finished the first/latest <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/2008/01/16/mini-review-mass-effect-xbox-360/">Mass Effect</a> DLC,
<a href="http://masseffect.bioware.com/galacticcodex/bringdownthesky.html">Bring Down the Sky</a>. It adds a new mission to the game which promises
~90 minutes of gameplay, a new location, a new race and a new XBL achievement
(worth 50 gamerpoints). It costs 400 MS Points (€4.80).</p>
<p>The mission was nice, nothing out of the ordinary, tho. Drive around in your Mako, clean out some places, gather “leads” (if you want to call them that)
and then face a boss guy. Make some Paragon/Renegade decisions, get a glimpse at a possible new story line to come and be done with it.</p>
<p>The aforementioned new location is an asteroid on a collision course with a colonised planet. The rock itself looks like pretty much like any of the old
“lesser” planets from the main game. It’s okay, not more, not less. What makes it special (to me) is the beautiful planet looming overhead — X57, the asteroid, is heading towards Terra Nova, destined to bring doom and destruction. A grim outlook! Still pretty, tho. Seriously, it’s really shiny,
but I’m a sucker for stars and planet imagery, so I might take more joy from something like this than other people.</p>
<p>Anyways, why is it heading there? Because of the Batarians, a race of 4-eyed humanoids. Apparently they don’t like the Humans for various historical reasons, and thus use their first on-screen appearance ever for speaking with the protagonists in a resentful manner. And for shooting at them. The audacity!</p>
<p>So, is “Bring Down the Sky” a perfect DLC/addon? No. Bioware’s decision to make this an “in-between mission” is questionable. I can understand it from a storyline point of view &ndash; too much is in flux after finishing the main game,
what with the Council and all. But unfortunately it means I have to go back to a savegame where I could freely roam the galaxy &ndash; i.e. a save that was made prior to visiting Ilos etc. —, and for some people that might be a drawback. A co-worker of mine has no save like that left, and that means he’d have to start over, and therefore he won’t pick up the DLC. So… srsly, not a good decision. (Personally, I was lucky to still have a “good” save, tho.) But the implementation could’ve been smoother. Well, I actually <em>expected</em> it to be smoother.</p>
<p>And what’s with the silent team members? I though Garrus and Kaiden were pissed since they wouldn’t talk to me during the mission. Not even random chatter. Meh. It’s a small issue, tho. Just something I found a bit strange.</p>
<p>All in all, tho, it’s been a nice ride. For the average price of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doener">Döner</a>
you get ~90 minutes of additional <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/2008/01/16/mini-review-mass-effect-xbox-360/">Mass Effect goodness</a>. A good bargain in my book.</p>

			 <hr>
<p>Dana and I went to the garden store earlier today, since she’s is working on cutting back our apple tree and realised that she needs better tools for that.</p>
<p>Trying to be a good and interested husband, I tagged along.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t like garden stores. Yes, pretty flowers and all that, but I don’t like stores <em>in general</em>, so it’s a drag. But I wanted to help her in finding the right tools, so there.</p>
<p>Then it dawned me that if I would change the <em>premise</em> of picking out tools, I could have much more fun. So I did. My premise?</p>
<p>Impending Zombie attack.</p>
<p>I got to admin: standing in front of all the tools, discussing saws, scythes, spades and hedge shears from the point of view of someone who is preparing for a Zombie attack was actually fun. <em>“Honey, look, if I could apply this thing to the small scythe here, it would give me an extra meter of reach… I could probably decapitate an undead before he comes in attack range. What do you think?” – “Yes, that would probably work.” – “What about the café over there? How many entrances has this place? How long could we hold it?”</em></p>
<p>I may be crazy, but I <em>feel</em> better prepared now.</p>

			 <p>So <a href="http://friendfeed.com/">Friendfeed</a> opened yesterday. Naturally, I had to sign in to take a look.</p>
<p>When I got to the point where it wanted me to configure the feeds and services to grab data from, it first asked for my Google Reader shared items. Okay, can do. Then it asked for my <a href="http://tumblr.zottmann.org/">Tumblr</a> name, and this is where my eyebrows went down.</p>
<p>So Tumblr allows me to bundle many of my “activities” in one place. Flickr,
blog posts, Twitter posts, links etc., you name it. It does so by querying your Flickr account, your blog(s), Twitter, your del.icio.us bookmark dump (to name a few) via their RSS feeds. And I believe many people are using this feature just for that. I know I do. So that’s usually the first (or even second) re-posting of original content.</p>
<p>Now lifestream services like Friendfeed come hopping along and are going to add <em>another</em> level of abstraction, in the form of aggregation of already aggregated content, or an RSS feed for the aggregated lifestream, or yet <em>another</em> social network layer, and/or by adding comments on top of that.</p>
<p>How much more meta can we go? This is some Zen shit, man.</p>
<p>I swear, one of these days someone will put yet <em>another</em> layer on this Crazy Content Cake of Doom and a black hole will open in the middle of the Internet and suck out all intelligence, reason and original content. (Yes, like Digg,
just a wee bit worse.)</p>
<p>Also, I am well aware that I, too, run <a href="http://escaloop.com/">my own version of a lifestream service</a>, and that my post might seem hypocritical, but by the Gods,
there’s a reason why I try to keep <a href="http://escaloop.com/">escaloop</a> simple.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Added some clarifications.</p>

			 <p>It’s amazing what 30 minutes of frantic walking can do for your sanity.
Tonight, when getting out of the subway and noticing my bus had just left,
I’ve popped in a 131bpm <a href="http://djsteveboy.com/podrunner.html">Podrunner</a> mix and started walking. A good 30 minutes later I found myself on my doorstep with a clear head.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://djsteveboy.com/podrunner.html">Podrunner</a>, a free weekly podcast of one hour gapless music mixes for workouts and the likes. The only trick is to find a bpm range that suits you. Then put it on your iPod.</p>
<p>It’s simply <em>that</em> good.</p>
<p>Nerdy pro tip: once you’ve found your bpm range, build a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Pipe</a> like <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/czottmann/podrunner_130139">I did</a> and subscribe to this feed instead of the <a href="http://www.djsteveboy.com/audio/podrunner.xml">original one</a> to only get podcasts which are “suited” for you.

			 <p>I’m done with the redesign. Both my <a href="http://tumblr.zottmann.org/">tumblelog</a> and this blog now share the same layout and (the most important parts of the) sidebar, adding some much needed consistency.</p>
<p>Also I’ve got rid of the Google Coop search and put the <a href="http://technorati.com/">Technorati</a> search to use instead, it’s good enough in my eyes.</p>
<p>The biggest change in functionality is the switch from the built-in Wordpress comments system to <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>, on both my blog and tumblelog. Naturally, I’ve added a tiny bit of logic to the Wordpress templates so the existing comments are preserved, displayed, and those entries are still accepting new comments
(assuming the <a href="http://www.jamesmckay.net/code/comment-timeout/">Comments Timeout plugin</a> allows it). But for new entries,
Disqus is used. I figured if I don’t like it, I can always switch back and cram the exported Disqus comments back into WP.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now if I could use Markdown for new posts instead of Textile, I’d be a happy camper. The <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/text-control/">WP Text Control plugin</a> is no help, unless you consider making the server drop the connection every time helping. I don’t.</p>
<p>Repeated tips of the hat to <a href="http://cubicle17.com/">Bill Israel</a> for sharing his wonderful
<a href="http://letterhead.tumblr.com/">Letterhead Tumblr theme</a> with the crowds (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC licensing</a> FTW!). Due to its beautifully simple semantic structure I was able to transform it into a Wordpress theme in about two hours. Thanks, Bill!</p>

			 <p>Seit mehreren Wochen sitzt in meinem Bus nahezu jeden Morgen eine Frau, die sich mit Hingabe während der kompletten Fahrt zum Bahnhof (~15min) schminkt.
Und ich spreche nicht vom schnellen Nachziehen des Lippenstifts, sondern von der großen Packung—Haare zurückstecken und ab gehts.</p>
<p>Ich wollte eigentlich die letzten paar Wochen schon etwas darüber schreiben,
bin aber immer davon abgekommen. Vielleicht war das gar nicht so schlecht; da ich mittlerweile ihre handwerklichen Fähigkeiten aus der Ferne bewundern gelernt habe, möchte ich ihr heute etwas hausgemachte Lyrik widmen.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over the last week I’ve been using <a href="http://rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a>. It’s a neat little service that’s keeping track of what you are doing all day long on your machine (Mac or PC) by logging which applications are having the focus. On the site you can then tag the different applications with different keywords (for example, my Mail.app times are tagged with “work”, “communications” and “email”).</p>
<p>And, to make it actually useful, you can analyse your time spent, graphs and all! Check the <a href="http://www.rescuetime.com/product_tour">product tour on RescueTime.com</a> for more infos and some screenshots. It’s pretty neat. (Yes, privacy concerns, blah blah blah. It’s not the topic of this article, so please keep it to yourself for the moment.
Thanks. :])</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>My problem, tho, is that I spend quite a bit of time both on the phone and in meetings. Naturally, RT won’t track these times, since these are basically off-screen activities. Uncool.</p>
<p>So after digging around in the RT log files I was amazed to learn they’re just
<a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> files. Eeeeexcellent. I can work with that!</p>
<p>But I wanted something with a GUI, something a bit “cooler” than just a Ruby script. So I took this as opportunity to get a bit into Applescript.
Unfortunately, RescueTime’s Mac doodad doesn’t offer an Applescript API, and I had to improvise.</p>
<p>After two hours of playing around and cursing at Applescript’s syntax (they’re all on crack…), I had something sufficiently cool to show for.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/02/picture-1.png" alt="RescueTime Log Time.app screenshot"></p>
<p>So, what is it? It’s a little application that you run everytime you want to log some off-screen time. Basically, it’s just a dialog that allows you to enter a number (i.e. minutes spent), and has some buttons to either log these minutes as “was on the phone” or “was in a meeting”. If you hit “Cancel”, it won’t do anything. (Surprise.)</p>
<p>Let’s say I’ve just spent 15 minutes on the phone, I’ll run the application,
enter “15” and hit the Return key—and the last 15 minutes will be logged as phone call in RT. The app will quit once that’s done. Another meeting, another phone call? Rinse, repeat.</p>
<p>Data-wise, it’ll then create a new file in the right format in RescueTime’s log directory (<code>~/Library/RescueTime/Logs/Pending/</code>). On the next data upload RT will pick up the new file, and it’ll appear in your stats as <em>“manual_phonecall”</em>. Your meetings will appear as <em>“manual_meeting”</em>.</p>
<p>Please note: <strong>Neither existing RescueTime files nor the RescueTime application will be touched or tinkered with.</strong></p>
<p>Below you’ll find two downloads. The first one is the actual script in plain text. The second is the script compiled as application bundle. If you’re unsure which to pick, you’ll most likely want the latter. ;)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/02/rescuetime-log-time.applescript" title="RescueTime Log Time.applescript">RescueTime Log Time.applescript</a></li>
<li><a href="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/02/rescuetime-log-time.zip" title="RescueTime Log Time.app">RescueTime Log Time application (ZIP file)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Have fun.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: I’ll take no responsibility for loss of data, hair or life. I am very, very sure there won’t be any losses, but still. It works for me, and I’m sharing. Use at your own risk.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://zottmann.org/2008/02/05/suggestions-for-additional.html">Suggestions for additional explicit service support</a></h1>

			 <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>so far, <a href="http://escaloop.com/">escaloop</a> has a couple of services it’s supporting explicitly,
which means there are rules to mark these services with their own service icon and maybe an adjusted wording when they are displayed. At the time of this post, these services are:</p>
<ul>
<li>del.icio.us</li>
<li>Digg</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Flickr</li>
<li>Google (search results etc.)</li>
<li>Google Reader (shared items)</li>
<li>Last.fm</li>
<li>Livejournal</li>
<li>Magnolia</li>
<li>Newsvine</li>
<li>Pownce</li>
<li>StumbleUpon</li>
<li>Tumblr</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Vimeo</li>
<li>Vox.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else is supported implicitly, which means it’s processed and displayed, but has no special icon or anything, it’s “just” another source.</p>
<p>So my question today is: do you have suggestions for other services that should be explicitly supported? If yes, please reply to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/escaloop/browse_thread/thread/f8d0fe3cc627c9f9">this topic</a> and provide both the URL to service/site as well as (if possible) an example feed or two so I can take a look. I won’t promise to include each and every suggestion; unfortunately, my spare time isn’t unlimited, and also it doesn’t make sense to support everything explicitely, methinks.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/escaloop/browse_thread/thread/f8d0fe3cc627c9f9">please tell me what you want!</a> It certainly can’t hurt. ;) Many thanks!</p>
<p>(I’ve closed the comments here, please sound off <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/escaloop/browse_thread/thread/f8d0fe3cc627c9f9">on the escaloop discussion board</a> instead.)</p>

			 <p>I’ve spent the last few hours bug testing, then deploying, then yelling at,
then hotfixing, then re-deploying a new version of <a href="http://escaloop.com/">both escaloop site and badge</a>. I didn’t include everything I was planning on initially, and instead decided to go for <em>“release early, release often”</em>.</p>
<p>A few highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added some juice and stability—hopefully everything runs a bit faster more solid now.</li>
<li>New feature: Source list, add a pretty list of all feeds in a badge to the end of the badge. Check <a href="http://escaloop.com/demo/">the demo badge</a> for an example and the <a href="http://escaloop.com/build/">badge builder</a> for the new config option.</li>
<li>Badge: added explicit support for Facebook, Digg, Newsvine and Vimeo feeds.</li>
<li>Badge: Changes in served badge JS and CSS; if you use local hacks, take a closer look at your escaloop-served “originals”.</li>
<li>Site: Restructured the site a bit.</li>
<li>Site: Added exhaustive workflow diagram to frontpage.</li>
<li>Site: Fix: Preview pages not cached anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you’ll like it. If you find bugs or have questions, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/escaloop">let me know on the message boards, please!</a> I’m all ears.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://zottmann.org/2008/01/16/020000.html">Mini Review: Mass Effect, Xbox 360</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://zottmann.org/2008/01/16/020000.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2008-01-16 02:00:00 &#43;0200">Jan 16, 2008</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Okay, yes, I’m late to the review party. In my defense, it has something to do with <a href="http://escaloop.com/">this</a> and the fact that I wanted to finish <a href="http://masseffect.bioware.com/">Mass Effect</a> twice before rendering my judgement.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/01/masseffect_04_325x440.jpg" alt="Mass Effect - Saren"></p>
<p>So, my first playthrough on normal difficulty was very thorough. I’ve picked a male (Infiltrator class), took the “good guy”
approach (<em>“We have to save the galaxy! &ndash; Wait, what’s that, old lady? Your kitten is trapped in this death maze? We’ll help!”</em>), also did pretty much every sidequest I could find, landed on every rock available, and ended up spending 34 hours or so. Hey, my char even had freaky, slightly awkward
(in the build-up) alien sex with <a href="http://www.threepanelsoul.com/view.php?date=2007-12-29">that endlessly blabbering blueberry</a>.
Dynomite.</p>
<p>The second time around I rolled a female (Soldier class) and played the whole game on hardcore difficulty in a <em>“I have a job to do, get out of my way”</em> kind of way. Short-tempered, gun-in-your-face attitude, not afraid to leave a crater. In short, for the most part I tried to play it like time actually mattered. This time I clocked in ~14 hours. And this time, my leading lady ended up ripping the clothes off one of her male subordinates. Oh, and she had freaky, surprising lesbian alien sex with some random NPC, without meaning to.</p>
<p>Shiny.</p>
<p>The game’s not without flaws, tho. The sidequests on the planets are a wee bit repetitive. There are some rather frequent framerate drops and “Halo 2”-style texture pop-in issues after the loading screens. Background noises were sometimes awfully quiet, and it was <em>really, really</em> hard to make them out,
which made some surroundings appear a bit sterile in the aural department. The squad NPC pathfinding took a short break from time to time, making me run back to show one of my compadres how to walk around the car. Oh, and Bioware? My wife asks whether for ME2 you could add some more samples to enemy NPCs, I think if she has to hear <em>“I will destroy you!”</em> or <em>“Go! Go! Go!”</em> one more time, she’ll be going postal.</p>
<p>But ultimately, in my book, it’s really a great game. Hey, it’s mostly
“Knights of the Old Republic”, albeit with a lot of changes! It might not perfect, but it comes close. The player char’s gender does make a difference every now and then. I liked the majority of the voice acting, the stories and side-quests were mostly laid out well, and the presentation was usually top notch. Especially the last 1-2 hours were <em>mighty</em> fine. Cinematical, even.
Wonderful, wonderful build up of tension.</p>
<p>All in all I’ve spent around 50-60 hours on Mass Effect, and enjoyed those. I recommend it.</p>

			 <p>A few months ago I was talking to <a href="http://mornography.co.uk/">Hendrik</a> about lifestreams, and in my ongoing struggle for his undying love (as a friend), I’ve whipped up a little somethingsomething using the wonderful <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Pipes</a>.</p>
<p><em>“Lifestream?”</em>, you ask. <em>“What the deuce is a lifestream?!”</em> A good question. A lifestream is basically a big bucket where all the updates and update notifications from your blog, your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention-Deficit_Disorder">ADD-induced</a> Twitter posts, your Flickr uploads etc come together in one concise way so it’s easier for others to ignore them. ;) Also, you only have one URL to hand out to hot women (or men) in pubs because the stream inadvertedly works as a hub page, too!</p>
<p>Now, while the prototype was quickly hacked together, it felt clunky. Sure,
you can pass a dozen URLs or so to the pipe, but what if the URLs would change? Or if you wanted to add a new one or delete one from the list? Then it’d be a lot of tinkering with the script call in your HTML code.</p>
<p>So I had the idea to build a site where you could configure the list of URLs and the layout and everything, and which would give you a HTML badge for your blog or site, a snippet that wouldn’t change.</p>
<p><a href="http://escaloop.com/">And today, I proudly open <strong>escaloop</strong> to the public.</a></p>
<p>I feel it’s <em>good enough</em> to test the waters, I believe. I’ve played around with it, fiddling with different implementations on different types of pages,
and it looks okay. I guess I could try to think of every possibility for every site on earth, but we know how that would turn out.</p>
<p>It certainly <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/lifestream/">looks fine on my own blog</a>. (Considering that I don’t have that many active feeds, that is.)</p>
<p>So with that, I’ll release <a href="http://escaloop.com/">escaloop</a> into the wild. It’s still a bit rough around the edges, and there might be bugs. That said: Please take a look, play around with it, build yourself a badge or two for your site, blog, MySpace page, whatever. If you have feedback, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/escaloop">please let me know in the escaloop Google Group</a>.</p>
<p>Have fun, Carlo</p>
<p>PS: You might ask what took me so long. In my defense, I am a lazy bastard.
Also, I wrote the first rough draft in Python, then switched to Ruby. There I’ve wrote the first prototype using the <a href="http://sinatra.rubyforge.org/">Sinatra</a> DSL, and finally settled to make use of nifty lightweight <a href="http://ramaze.net/">Ramaze</a> framework. (By the way, Sinatra is nice, but not what <em>I</em> was looking for.)</p>
<p>During the last few months I’ve also <em>had to</em> put a lot of time into <a href="http://masseffect.bioware.com/">Mass Effect</a>, which is a great game. You understand.</p>

			 <p>So, (almost) everyone is totally crazy for lifestreams these days. In case you managed to get around the whole issue so far: a lifestream is basically a big bucket (i.e. web page) where all the updates and update notifications from your blog, your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention-Deficit_Disorder">ADD-induced</a> Twitter posts, your Flickr uploads etc come together in one concise way so it’s easier for others to ignore them. Also,
you only have one URL to hand out to hot women in pubs because the stream inadvertedly works as a hub page, too!</p>
<p>Joy.</p>
<p>Anyways, I was talking with <a href="http://mornography.co.uk/">Hendrik</a> about the various stream services out there, and I figured it’d be fairly easy to build something server-less using a wee bit of Javascript and <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Pipes</a>. So I’ve spent around an hour to do just that.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that you make <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=Vhz_ufp_3BGo8ei5X0sBXw">a pipe containing all your feeds</a>, and then access the output using Javascript from your page. Add some styling, <a href="http://docs.g-blog.net/code/lifestream/morn_test.html">and voilá</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a bit rough around the edges, but hey, it’s just a prototype. It’s not life- or game-changing in any way, but I’d like to share anyways.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2007-11-21:</strong> It’s mostly broken right now since I am playing around with something. Not to worry.</p>

Dort haben wir sofort einen Platz bekommen, mussten uns aber von der Bedienung “massregeln” lassen, weil ich nix trinken wollte, Min nach einer Limo fragte (Antwort: <em>“Nur in der Mass!”</em>) und Julian um einen Spezi bat (<em>“Hört mal, was seid Ihr denn für welche?

<p>Die Speisekarte war ein offener “Fuck you, hahahaha”-Brief an den Verbraucherschutz (die meisten “normalen” Gerichte pegeln zwischen 15 und 22€). Wir wollten dann was zu Essen bestellen, aber die Bedienung meinte nur <em>“Nah, erst die Getränke”</em>, kam dann aber nach 30 sek zurück, um uns mitzuteilen, dass wir, wenn wir in der Mittagspause wären, eh nur Hendl essen könnten, weil alles andere länger als 30 min dauert. Da ich aber kein Hendl wollte, schon gar nicht für 9€, bin ich eben gegangen, und hab mir ‘ne Haxnsemmel geholt. Die war auch nicht so toll.</p>
<p>Julian war das alles irgendwie peinlich, und ich hab ihm nahegelegt, sich bei der Bedienung aufrichtig dafür zu entschuldigen, dass wir sie belästigt haben.</p>
<p>Fuckers. Gott, ich hasse diesen ganzen Wiesnbetrieb. Kann das nicht nach Nürnberg ausgelagert werden oder so?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>(Disclaimer: The following paragraphs might be pointless and you might end up feeling I have once again stated the obvious. So… you’ve been warned.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/21/google-to-out-open-facebook-on-november-5/">TechCrunch reports</a> on Google apparently working with some unnamed industry bigshots on opening up their social networks services.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday a select group of fifteen or so industry luminaries attended a highly confidential meeting at Google’s headquarters in Mountain View to discuss the company’s upcoming plans to address the “Facebook issue.” […]
Google’s goal – to fight Facebook by being even more open than the Facebook Platform. If Facebook is 98% open, Google wants to be 100%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, we’ll see how that’ll pan out.</p>
<p>I have been discussing the whole Facebook API thing with friends and co-
workers over the past few weeks. You are constantly hearing about how cool it is that <em>“Facebook is open”</em>, that everyone can build FB applications and become wealthy and all that jazz, but most people have already figured something out—it isn’t open. It’s a goddamn closed system.</p>
<p>So let’s assume you want to use their rich API set to build the next killer application and get rich in the process. How’s that going to work? Yes, you can build cool stuff. Definitely. It’s just—how are you going to monetize your work? In the end, in my eyes, there are but two types of applications:</p>
<ol>
<li>Advertisements, i.e. marketing widgets/apps that display links (in different forms, of course), trying to get the user to click through to a non-FB site.</li>
<li>For-fun apps like games or graffiti-wall-alikes, which completely run within the boundaries of FB and never leave them.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing. Either you&rsquo;re building something that is basically an eye-catcher for your <em>already existing site</em>, not unlike a digital carnival barker, and hope to get attention and visitors coming from Facebook to your site. Or you build something far more complex, inside Facebook, without a viable way to make money from it. Which might cool from a hobbyist point of view, but is crap when you build things for a living. What&rsquo;s built for Facebook stays in Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="http://mornography.de/">Hendrik</a> noted the other day that if there was some sort of “Facebook points” (akin to Xbox Live Arcade points or Linden Dollars), i.e.
micropayments, the situation would be far more interesting for professionals.
And he’s right. Alas, there’s no such thing. Too bad.</p>
<p>So, to me, it seems that right now everyone developing <em>real</em> applications within Facebook is an unpaid semi-employee of <a href="http://Facebook.com">Facebook.com</a>. If you need to make money on the web to put food on your own table, I don’t think is an option. There is no incentive. So far, Facebook is a purely hobbyist platform.
End of story.</p>
<p>I might be completely wrong about this, mind you. But I still don’t understand all the applause and excitement about the prospect of writing Facebook applications. Just saying.</p>

			 <p><a href="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2007/09/pipes_explosm_example.png" title="Y! Pipes: HTML processing, Explosm.net Example. The link to the Y! Pipes page is at the end of the blog entry."><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2007/09/pipes_explosm_example_thumb.jpg" alt="Y! Pipes: HTML processing, thumb"></a>Over the weekend I finally had some time to continue playing around with <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Pipes</a>. (Turns out that quitting World of Warcraft makes your days longer. Huh. Who&rsquo;d have thought…)  It really is a neat toy/tool.</p>
<p>Alas, it is not without hitches. If you&rsquo;ve worked with Pipes before, you know that it has a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/docs?doc=sources#FetchData">module named &lsquo;Fetch Data&rsquo;</a>, but unfortunately this module is only able to deal with XML and JSON data. It&rsquo;s just that it will outright reject anything else. And most HTML pages fall in this category.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my story on how I managed to make Pipes process run-of-the-mill HTML pages. I couldn&rsquo;t find anything on this topic on the net, so even though I don&rsquo;t think I am the first guy to tackle this problem, I want to share what I found out.</p>
<p>A little background. I wanted to build a comic feed for <a href="http://explosm.net/">Explosm.net&rsquo;s Cyanide &amp; Happiness</a>, a comic strip for the …wicked. C&amp;H has an official RSS feed, but it only carries links to the new comic pages. Which is fine and dandy for most people, but <em>I am a busy guy</em>, you know, what with my hectic web-3.1 lifestyle and all, and I really can&rsquo;t afford to even lose 20 seconds by clicking through <em>to anywhere</em>. (Read: I&rsquo;m really lazy.)</p>
<p>So I tried to make Pipes to parse the Explosm.net comic pages and produce a Pipes-powered feed that not only had the link, but also the particular comic image for that day.</p>
<p>I started out with the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/docs?doc=sources#FetchFeed">Fetch Feed module</a> reading the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Explosm">Explosm.net RSS feed</a>. I am usually not interested in anything but the comics, so in a second step, I made use of the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/docs?doc=operators#Filter">Filter module</a> to ditch feed items that doesn&rsquo;t contain the word &ldquo;comic&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So that left me with a list of feed items, each with a link, a description, a title and some other metadata.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the trouble started. Boy, what was I thinking?! The HTML pages are far from perfect, they sure as hell doesn&rsquo;t validate as XML. Then again — that&rsquo;s alright! The site wasn&rsquo;t made for scraping or parsing, it was made to display -tasteful- weird comic strips, and that&rsquo;s enough. I like it for that.  It&rsquo;s just that there is no Pipes module to grab a glob of textual data and work with it. (Yet? Please, someone say &ldquo;Yet&rdquo;, employing a knowing undertone.)</p>
<p>After a while of trying to beat any of the available <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/docs?doc=sources">&lsquo;Fetch *&rsquo; modules</a> into submission, I was close to giving up. But then I remember I had come across a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Tidy">HTML Tidy</a> service a few months or years ago. After a few minutes, I had rediscovered it: <a href="http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/tidy">W3C&rsquo;s own Tidy service</a>. It&rsquo;ll digest any HTML page (you just pass the address), and it will clean it up and return valid a XHTML document, which also constitutes as XML. Huzzah!</p>
<p>Well then, commence plumbing! The third module I used was the wonderful <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/docs?doc=operators#Loop">Loop module</a>. It&rsquo;s special because it will process every item in a given dataset, in this case it&rsquo;d iterate over all remaining feed items. I&rsquo;ve told the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/docs?doc=operators#Loop">Loop module</a> to use the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/docs?doc=string#StringBuilder">String Builder module</a>, there I concatenated the Tidy URL, <a href="http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/tidy?forceXML=on&amp;docAddr="><code>http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/tidy?forceXML=on&amp;docAddr=</code></a>, with the <code>item.link</code> attribute, and assigned the resulting string to a new a attribute, <code>item.link_tidy</code>.</p>
<p>Step four consisted of another <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/docs?doc=operators#Loop">Loop</a>, in which I would use a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/docs?doc=sources#FetchData">Fetch Data module</a> to grab the data from the Tidy&rsquo;d Explosm.net pages, which had now been transformed into neat and valid XML structures and therefore could be digested by the module. It took me a few minutes to find the exact location of the image element (<code>body.div.table.tr.td.div.0.div.1.table.tr.td.1.div.font.0.content</code>), which I then stored in a new attribute named <code>item.content</code>.</p>
<p><em>(While we&rsquo;re at it, in the future I would very much like to have the option to use XPath addressing in &lsquo;Fetch Data&rsquo;… or any related module, for that matter. Thanks in advance. :) )</em></p>
<p>Anyways, the next steps are using yet another <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/docs?doc=operators#Loop">Loop</a> to concatenate the image HTML with the original <code>item.description</code>, and then <em>another</em> one to rewrite the original image URLs a bit so the images are served through the free and excellent <a href="http://coralcdn.org/">Coral Distribution Network</a>.</p>
<p><em>(Technically, I might not be stealing from Explosm.net, especially since they allow hotlinking of their comic strips from message boards and pretty much anywhere, but for the sake of this example and story here, and the assumption that a few people might end up cloning the Pipe — yes, I am a dreamer —, I feel a bit better knowing I leave less of a footprint on their image servers.)</em></p>
<p>Then it was applying a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/docs?doc=operators#Reverse">Reverse module</a> to flip the order of the items (a cosmetical issue), and that was it.</p>
<p>So, to sum up this long and rather tedious story: you <em>can</em> process HTML pages with Yahoo! Pipes. It&rsquo;s just not as straightforward as you would expect.</p>
<p>Well, and if you want to take a look at it: here&rsquo;s <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=Om0bps5i3BGKQJR0l7okhQ">the finished Pipe</a> — it might not look like much since the HTML preview doesn&rsquo;t show the images, but the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=Om0bps5i3BGKQJR0l7okhQ&amp;_render=rss">RSS output</a> is complete.</p>
<p>Tip o' the hat to <a href="http://explosm.net/">Cyanide &amp; Happiness</a> for mindblowing hijinx, the <a href="http://w3.org">W3C</a> for the free &amp; open Tidy service, and the <a href="http://coralcdn.org/">CDN</a> for being good people.</p>
<p>Now go and use <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Pipes</a>. It&rsquo;s one of the cooler products we (as a company) have released in the last few years, and quite frankly, it deserves praise.</p>
<p>So there.</p>

<p>Update, 2007-09-19:* I&rsquo;ve slightly adjusted the element addressing in the Pipe to waterproof it a bit. The general idea and order of the modules didn&rsquo;t change, tho.</p>
<p><strong>Update, 2007-12-07:</strong> My technique has been superceded by the offical new <a href="http://blog.pipes.yahoo.com/2007/12/06/new-fetch-page-module-and-nice-web-path-enhancement/">Fetch Page module</a> — enjoy! :)</p>

			 <p>Looks like there is <a href="http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?tags=cats&amp;format=lol">a new Flickr API output format: LOL</a>. Not my work, no idea who built this, but I really like it.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of returned data (<code>?tags=cats&amp;format=lol</code>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HAI</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>IM IN UR BUCKETS MAKING UP FORMATS
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>GIMME PHOTOS FROM EVERYONE TAGGED CATS WITH GEODATA

<p>Grab the data <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/">as usual</a>, the <code>format</code> attribute is <code>lol</code>, apparently.</p>
<p>So… If you always thought about teaching your cat how to parse Flickr data,
now might be the right time to jump in. Progress!</p>

			 <p>Okay, maybe that was a bit harsh, but think about it for a moment. Everyone is complaining about power consumption and global warming and whatnot, <em>THE EARTH IS DYING!!!1oneoneeleven</em>, yet by now it’s <strong>really fucking hard</strong> to find a decent mouse or keyboard that does have a cable.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>I seriously don’t understand why it’s necessary and accepted among computer users to have a formerly cable-bound piece of hardware that now doesn’t “need”
a cable anymore, but batteries (rechargable or not). Or worse: the mice that come with their own base stations and power adapters.</p>
<p>Mind you, your mouse and keyboard are usually around 50cm to 1m away from your Mac or PC. So why not use something with a cable?</p>
<p>I am currently shopping for a new mouse, hence the confusion. Well, actually I am annoyed. I was eying the beautiful Logitech MX Revolution, which is a wonderful piece of equipment, is ergonomic, has the right size for my paws, it would be perfect!</p>
<p>Unfortunately (for Logitech) I refuse to buy something as mundane as a pointing device with its own PCU. Sure, they probably don’t care.</p>

			 <p><a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://pownce.com/">Pownce</a> are broken. <a href="http://myspace.com/">MySpace</a>, too. Oh, and pretty much every social networking site on the planet, too. For me, at least.</p>
<p>It’s not the technical aspect. Not the concept, either.</p>
<p>(Well, I don’t understand the hype and/or praise sites like Twitter is getting. From a technical standpoint, it’s well done, I won’t argue that, but I don’t get the <em>point</em> of the sites. But back to the topic.)</p>
<p>No, it’s the semantics.</p>
<p>You see, offline, I don’t call many people “friend”. This doesn’t mean I am surrounded by unpleasant people, quite the contrary. But I make a difference between friends and pals or contacts. A friend is someone I would risk my life for. Usually this two-way trust has grown over a few years, and is something important to me.</p>
<p>Now, online, I am <em>expected</em> to call every Tom, Dick or Harry “friend”, and somehow, that doesn’t work for me. I create an account at, let’s say, Pownce,
and am instantly bombarded by new friend requests. Usually by people I haven’t spoken to before, let alone met.</p>
<p>Yeah… I am afraid I can’t do that, Digital Dave.</p>
<p>Sites like <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> do it differently. People are “contacts”. If I decided I like them, I can promote them to “friends” or “family”. Which is okay. If we have spoken online, maybe in the office, maybe even met, then I am willing to add you as “contact”. That’s cool and <em>not</em> diminishing our relationship.</p>
<p>And this is my point: just calling someone “contact” instead of “friend”
doesn’t mean I don’t like that person. It just means I don’t know him/her well enough to consider him/her a “friend”. Because to me, this word has a <em>meaning</em>. Shying away from labeling you “friend” isn’t impolite, it’s honest.
<strong>Because we are not friends.</strong></p>
<p>There are people I am fond of, people I like, but with whom I am not <em>that</em> close. I enjoy hanging out with them, and I enjoy their company, but they’re not my friends. And that is perfectly alright, for both them and myself.</p>
<p>(Truth to be told, it wasn’t always like this. But I’m growing older, and my views change.)</p>
<p>Another example: The other day there was a bit of drama in our little <a href="http://cluckworkorange.com/">WoW guild</a>. There was a younger lad who we were playing and chatting with quite often. At some point, he felt thoroughly insulted when Christian (pal of mine)
and I kindly tried to explain to him that we were not his friends. Heck, we had never met. We were playing an online game together, and chatting a lot while doing so. We tried to get the message across, tried to explain that we liked him, but we didn’t consider him a friend in the true sense. He got upset and left the guild in anger.</p>
<p>Well, it happens. Not much I can do about it.</p>
<p>The net is our (relatively) new world. Our habits are changing, human relationships might, too—at least a bit. Still, should we abandon our values?
If everyone is a “friend”, it means nobody is. For me, this prospect leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Dear site builders, please stop trying to build a virtual Woodstock. I know you’re probably just trying to achieve a feeling of <em>“I belong here”</em> for your users so they come back, but for God’s sake, stop making me pretend I care equally about everyone. Because I don’t.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p><strong>Update, 2007-07-25, 9:18 CEST:</strong> jr <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/2007/07/24/were-not-friends-sorry/#comment-7508">suggested</a> the use of a new word for this type of online kinship, and I like the idea. His suggestion was “webbie”, but to me that sounds too much like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webby">a certain online award</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, my personal proposal is the use of “webster”. I’ve checked
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster">Wikipedia</a>, the original meaning of the word has kind of “expired”, so let’s re-use it. :) Are you with me, people?</p>

			 <p>After reading another <em>great</em> press release I think I now know what “Web 2.0”
means. Up until now I was convinced that if you asked 10 people what it means,
you’d get 10 different answers. Turns out all the tech guys have it wrong,
tho.</p>
<p>You see, it’s all in the pronunciation. It’s not <em>“Web two-point-zero”</em>, it’s actually <em>“Web two-point-oh”</em>. As in <em>“Web two-point-OH-MY-GOD WE’RE, LIKE,
TOTALLY COOL”</em>.</p>
<p>Don’t laugh.</p>
<p>The other day I looked with a friendly non-tech guy at some purdy web pages.
(I am not dissing him for not knowing this stuff, he is not a programmer,
which is completely okay. I am just telling this to illustrate a point.) It went like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Guy, pointing: “That looks pretty cool, what with it sliding out smoothly
and all! Ah, Web 2.0, great. Is that AJAX?”</p>
<p>Me: “No, it’s a <em>‘dropdown’</em>.”</p>
<p>Guy, pointing: “Or here, all these big image things with the text, that is
Web 2.0, right?”</p>
<p>Me: “No, it’s static images with text link overlays.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you, crazy Internet marketing hype machine. I wish you weren’t decentralized so I could come visit and burn you down.</p>
<p>That term should be banned from the face of the net. Every time I tell people I work on the Intertubes for a living, it’s always <em>“Wow, like Web 2.0?”</em>.</p>
<p>Okay, fellow tech guys, listen up, this needs to stop. I propose answering questions like that with <em>“No, not ‘Web 2.0’ and ‘AJAX’, we’re doing BARF now.
‘BARF’ stands for ‘Bidirectional Asynchronous Request Forwarding’, it’s hot right now. I could explain it, but it’d probably take too long. There’s a number of articles on oreilly.com, look it up, it’s great. It’s going to be in the next release of Django and Rails, man—right in the core, built-in!!”</em></p>
<p>Don’t tell me it wouldn’t work, <strong>don’t tell me it wouldn’t work</strong>.</p>
<p>If you’re laughing right now or thinking I am just saying this, you’re mistaken. Let’s turn the Bullshit Train around. I am dead serious.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p><strong>Update #1:</strong> The acronym was inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barf_%28soap%29">the fine Iranian soap products</a>,
of course.</p>
<p><strong>Update #2:</strong> I changed the phrase from “Bitwise Asynchronous Request Forwarding” to “Bidirectional Asynchronous Request Forwarding”. <em>It just makes more sense that way.</em></p>

<p>It just dawned me that on the web, Germany must be to the UK and US what China is to the rest of the “real” World (at least in the perception of the rich western countries): copycats.</p>
<p>Cases in point: <a href="http://frazr.com/de/">Frazr</a> vs. <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://studivz.de/">StudiVZ</a> vs. <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, a dozen del.icio.us clones vs. <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>.</p>
<p>Seriously, the (visible part of the) German startup scene is making a <em>sad</em> impression. Pretty much each new German site I see is more or less a carbon copy of a successful UK or US site. The other day I was even approached whether I wanted to help clone <a href="http://pownce.com/">Pownce</a> (<em>“Hey, how quickly could one copy a site like that?”</em>). What happened to ingenuity and/or integrity?</p>
<p>I really start to believe I know <a href="http://www.thealarmclock.com/euro/archives/2006/04/lowbudget_web_wizard_on_conten.html">the only original guy around</a>.</p>

			 <p>Dear Perl community,</p>
<p>I just wasted 15 minutes of my life trying to figure out how to get the index of a particular element in an array. Turns out I have to write a <code>for</code> loop to walk through the array. This is insulting.</p>
<p>Seriously, it’s 2007. If at this point in time you’re still defending your beloved language and/or using words like “elegant” or “quick” when describing Perl, you’re <em>bat shit crazy</em>. My 2c.</p>
<p>Love, Carlo.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum, 2007-07-04, 9:14 CEST:</strong> I forgot to mention a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>It wasn’t my choice to use Perl, I just have to deal with it.</li>
<li>I was talking about a <em>very</em> limited set of <em>unique</em> strings.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cookbook/">Perl Cookbook</a> offered a solution, which is seven lines of code, the core being a <code>for</code> loop.</li>

			 <p>So I have 100 invites for this new site called <a href="http://spock.com/">Spock.com</a>. In a nutshell,
I see it as Wikipedia + search engine, but just about people. It’s an interesting approach. For a general quick explanation, feature list, a few screenshots and all around overview, see <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/11/exclusive-screenshots-spocks-new-people-engine/">this TechCrunch article</a>.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that it’s not a social network, but more of a meta-
hub that allows you to find, tag and describe yourself and/or others. Like a mix of <a href="http://jyte.com/">Jyte</a> and <a href="http://claimid.com/">ClaimID</a>. It’ll be interesting to see it either take off completely (like Wikipedia) or tank completely (because of malicious users).</p>
<p>Anyways, I have invites to give away. If anyone is interested, leave a comment below or email me at <a href="mailto:carlo@zottmann.org">carlo@zottmann.org</a>. I’ll need your email address for that.</p>
<p>And if you already have access to it, stop by <a href="http://www.spock.com/user48c0s5464k3150p10s7k20c0p5844k9c57425c">my entry</a>.</p>

			 <p>The other day I met Justin Timberlake at a bus station here in Munich.</p>
<p>That was quite bizarre, he was just standing there, apparently waiting for the bus. At first, I wasn’t sure whether it was really him; just a guy in a shirt,
jeans and a jacket. I glanced at him a couple of times, the man looked a wee bit pissed, but not too much. You know how it is—you look at someone,
wondering whether your mind is playing tricks on you, or whether you’re going crazy, because what you see is highly improbable.</p>
<p>After two minutes I’ve decided to say something. He had noticed me glancing,
but hadn’t said anything. And there’s only so much glancing you can do before it becomes impolite or even rude.</p>
<p>I cleared my throat. “Mr. Timberlake?”, I asked.</p>
<p>He looked at me, still appearing a bit pissed.</p>
<p>“Allow me to introduce myself,” I’ve said. “My name’s Carlo Zottmann, I live here, and I work on the interwebs for a living.”</p>
<p>His brows narrowed a bit; puzzled, he appeared to be.</p>
<p>“I like your music. Not everything, but a couple of your songs are rather cool. Just wanted to let you know.” With that, I smiled and turned away.</p>
<p>After a moment he said, “Why did you tell me that?”</p>
<p>I turned back to face him. “Well, I know who you are and what you do. I think it’s only fair to level the playing field. And claiming I’d be your biggest fan and have all your albums would be a lie, so why do it.”</p>
<p>He grinned. “True.” And that was that, then.</p>
<p>Or not. Half a minute later and turned to me again and asked, “Do you know a pub or something around here?”</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>That’s how I ended up having a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weissbier">Weissbier</a> with him at the <a href="http://www.lehners-wirtshaus.de/">Lehner’s</a> in Trudering. Who’d have thought? Turned out he was dumped by some woman in the middle of Munich <em>without his entourage</em> (he didn’t want to go into details,
but I think it was planned to be a romantic evening), and he didn’t feel like calling them. Instead he had opted for walking around a bit. Makes sense,
Munich isn’t that big. We talked about our families and life, the job, the usual stuff. That was pretty cool, I have to admit. He’s just another bloke,
his job seems to be more glamorous than mine, but only a bit.</p>
<p>Fun fact: almost noone seemed to recognize him. I ordered for him, and there are a lot of english speakers in town anyways, so hearing another language is not unusual. Heh. When bringing us the bill, the waitress caught a closer look and for a moment seemed to faint. J’s expression hardened ever so slightly,
and he seemed to prepare himself for the unavoidable things to come, but I manage to interrupt.</p>
<p>“Don’t. <em>Please.</em>”, I asked her.</p>
<p>“But… this is…”, she started.</p>
<p>“I know who he is. Please, don’t. Show some mercy.” I grinned at her. “I don’t think he’ll object to giving you an autograph, but give the man some quiet time.”</p>
<p>She pondered it for a moment, and finally smiled. “Okay.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>So he paid for the food and the drinks, gave her the promised autograph, and then we slipped out. By then it was night, and the humidity of the day had vanished a bit.</p>
<p>“Well, thanks for the beer, Carlo.” he said.</p>
<p>I took the offered hand. “I didn’t pay. Thank you. Hey, need a lift or anything? I could call Dana, we could bring you back to the hotel…”</p>
<p>He interrupted me with a quick shake of his head. “Nah, ’s cool. I’ll walk back. Or take the subway.”</p>
<p>“Really? You sure?”</p>
<p>“Your town is tiny. I’ll manage.”</p>
<p>“Screw you, Timberlake. Munich fuckin’ rocks.”</p>
<p>He laughed. “Take care.”</p>
<p>“You, too.”</p>
<p>After that, I walked home. It’s only 20 minutes by foot, and it helped me to clear my head. Dana couldn’t believe what I told her after coming through the door, and was (understandably) a bit miffed I didn’t call her when we we’re still at the restaurant. I promised her to let her know right away the next time I met a celebrity at the bus station. Heh.</p>
<p>And that was how I had a drink with Justin Timberlake, of all people.</p>
<p>Now, this anecdote has been one of the greatest in my life, and is obviously completely made up. I consider it an excercise in <a href="http://doodleplex.com/glassmaze/index.php/lieterature">LIEterature</a>. So there.</p>

			 <p>The other day I talked about <a href="/2007/06/07/madrid-or-why-were-all-doomed/">our impending doom</a>, but Madrid wasn’t totally bad.</p>
<p>In fact, I had two great nights there. On Monday, after I’ve arrived, my esteemed colleagues and I went to a little tapas restaurant whose name I forgot. Too bad, because it was rather spiffy. Nice food, great wine, much fun. We actually walked there from the office, so I managed to get some quick glimpses at the city. Beats driving around in a taxi.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/a534355806_faabe04b62.jpg" alt="Rosa Jiménez at Casa Patas, Madrid, Spain, June 6th 2007"> On Tuesday, the good folks of <a href="http://es.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Spain</a> took us to <a href="http://www.casapatas.com/">Casa Patas</a>, a Flamenco-themed restaurant. Really nice food, good wine (once again). Around 22:30 we’ve all been <em>really</em> stuffed, and wondering where to go next, when we were told that there was a Flamenco show coming up, and we had tickets.</p>
<p>Now, mind you, I had no idea what to expect. Flamenco had never really appeared on my radar prior to that evening.</p>
<p>To make it short: it was <em>one hell</em> of a show. There were three singers, Pepe Jiménez, José “El Flaco” and Pedro Jiménez, two guitars, Jesus Losada and Victor “El Tomate” (I am not making this up, it’s what the pamphlet said).
Also, three dancers: Primitivo Daza, Miguel Canas and Rosa Jiménez. (Thanks to
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/david_o/">David</a> for letting me use the picture.)</p>
<p>And quite frankly, they rocked the house.</p>
<p>The music was superb. The dancing was mindblowing. It was an awesome evening,
and I was completely blown away. The other guys had a good time as well, and it’s been quite something!</p>
<p>Many thanks to both Marcos and Arno from <a href="http://es.yahoo.com/">the Madrid office</a> for planning a great night out. Here’s hoping you’ll never come to Munich because quite frankly, I wouldn’t know how to top that. ;)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I still have no idea what kind of Flamenco I had witnessed.
Apparently there are around 50 different styles of Flamenco, and I am a total n00b when it comes to classifying kickass foreign ethno entertainment. :p After spending some time listening to many different artists (<a href="http://pandora.com/">Pandora.com</a>
and <a href="http://last.fm/">Last.fm</a> be praised), I hadn’t made any progress. So I’ve asked my Spanish coworkers, and they couldn’t tell me either.</p>
<p>Then I’ve mailed the folks at Casa Patas (in English), explaining which show I had seen, and asking whether they could tell me the subtype(s) of Flamenco that were shown this evening, and guess what I got back? A form letter, <em>in Spanish</em>, with a rather lengthy Word document, describing the history of Flamenco, <em>in Spanish</em>. Gee, thanks. I wonder what made them think I could speak Spanish, after writing them in another language. ;)</p>
<p>So, that didn’t help either. It means listening to more music then, hoping to find something I might like. Well, that can’t hurt, but it’s driving me nuts to listen and listen and listen and not find the <em>right</em> thing.</p>
<p>Before discovering the Internet I’ve had a bit more patience, I think.</p>

plan/platform</a>, I’ve decided it’s definitely not worth $20/month for me.</p>
<p>Seriously, it’s just a wee blog, nothing big. In fact, it’s mostly a plain vanilla Wordpress setup. Nothing special there. And also I don’t get many visitors, so I was surprised to see the site to awfully slow. What gives? On top of that is the SSH access responding at glacier speeds at any given time;
very underwhelming, too.</p>
<p>So I’ve packed my things and set up shop at <a href="http://www.asmallorange.com/">A Small Orange</a>. It’s small,
it’s (said to be) reliable, and the change has been astounding (to me). It’s nothing <em>fancy</em> in the sense that they redefine web hosting or anything, they just host my stuff, and that’s it. Which is fine.</p>
<p>In the end, I pay a 1/4 of what Media Temple cost me, and in return get something that is more like what I was looking for. At least for the last two days. ;)</p>
<p>I might keep you updated about the long(er) term experience.</p>

			 <hr>
<p>A few days ago, the <a href="http://de.yahoo.com">company</a> sent me to Madrid, Spain,
for a summit.</p>
<p>Madrid was nice. I’ve met a lot of friendly people, co-workers and random passersby alike, taxi drivers and dancers (more on that later), and made some observation which lead me to believe our attempts at saving the climate are futile.</p>
<p>In short: from what I observed over the course of three days, along with what I’ve seen during our days on Teneriffe, Spain’s collective consciousness doesn’t seem to give a damn about energy conservation.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, please. Germany is far from being perfect and totally awesome in that regard, but most people are <em>trying</em> by now. Also the government tries to get people to conserve energy, to recycle, to re-use things. Hell, I remember the recycling ads from my childhood, so apparently the effort is made for a good number of years by now.</p>
<p>But Spain… man, this was nuts. One-off styrofoam cups everywhere. Two or three plastic cups at the watercooler, at once, which are thrown away after one go. (I mean, why wouldn’t you, there are many more available.) I was hard pressed to find four (4!) ceramic cups in the entire office, and used one of those then. (Seriously, I am not recycling my pants off for years just to start using styrofoam cups again while being away.) People leaving their cars running while they were waiting for someone on the street, for 10 minutes, 15 minutes… Incredible. (Apparently fuel isn&rsquo;t expensive enough yet.) And so on.</p>
<p>Then I talked to a colleague from France who told me that they started a “let’s recycle, everybody!” campaign last year or so. <em>Last year.</em> Which means that until last year, the concept seemed foreign to them.</p>
<p>There were more little things I’ve noticed which made me raise my eyebrows every now and then. Now, I am not a tree hugger and I don’t think I am the awesomest dude around when it comes to energy conservation and reducing waste (thusly reducing CO2 production). But if you’re a concerned human which at this point everyone <em>should</em> be, I think, then you can’t look at shit like this and help but twitch.</p>
<p>In the end it is a governmental fault. See, here in Germany the political caste has adopted CO2 reduction as an urgent issue, and sometimes they even do <em>act</em> accordingly. But even if they <em>don’t</em> they usually present it as burning issue, and hearing it over and over again, many people have adjusted or are at least starting to. Somehow the system kindasorta works, even if it could work better, but we’re getting there… I hope. None of us is without sin, so there.</p>
<p>But apparently a lot of <em>European</em> countries seem to hope the problem might just go away by itself. Which I find highly disturbing and which makes me think we’re all doomed.</p>

			 <p>A week ago I was doing some home improvement. Well, I tried. And failed. In a spectacular way—the carpet cutter slipped and chopped through the back of my thumb.</p>
<p>For a split second I had a clear look at my joint, then it got messy.</p>
<p>Well, Dana got me to the ER – not after saving my life, tho! Standing upright next to the stairs (upper end), I lost consciousness for about 30 seconds. She grabbed and yelled at me, and after a while I blinked and was back. Oiy.</p>
<p>Anyways, we got into the ER, and the friendly lady at the reception desk said <em>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&quot;</em>, and I could <strong>finally</strong> say the one thing I had always envisioned, yet never had the chance to pull off.</p>
<p><em>“I’m bleeding.”</em></p>
<p>Had to grin a bit after I’ve said it. So worth it. (Well, not really.)</p>
<p>To make a long story short, they stitched my thumb together again. Turns out I had actually really reached the joint, and even partially cut a tendon.
Splendid.</p>
<p>Now my whole hand is in a cast.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2007/05/photo-67.jpg" alt="Cast"></p>
<p>Typing is slow as molasses, mostly because the freaking cast is in the way.
The stitches are starting to itch, which probably is a good thing, but that doesn’t make it better.</p>
<p>The doc gave me two weeks off, and until then, the web is mostly “read-only”
for me. Because writing is slow, as mentioned—this blog entry took half an hour.</p>

You see, I grew up in Eastern Germany, and while I had no problems or real shortcomings there, I never really had the chance to buy computer magazines of any sort (programming, gaming etc.)—simply because <em>there were none</em>.</p>
<p>Well, then one happy day, friends of my parents from Western Germany visited us, and lo and behold, they brought a few dozen (slightly outdated) computing magazines, just for me.</p>
<p>Needless to say, a great day in my life.</p>
<p>But with the advent of the Intertron I retreated more and more from reading paper magazine, mostly because they’re too slow. And also have horrible search facilities. Plus the links don’t work, or even worse, <em>there are none</em>.</p>
<p>Still, I read some magazines. Not many, just a very few. Mostly on the weekends, because it’s so much cooler to read while lying in a hammock, and let’s face it, a laptop in a hammock just doesn’t cut it.</p>
<p>So, what do I read these days?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/">Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin</a>—great little publication, comes with the SZ Friday issue. It may sound silly, but I really fell for that one. I consider it one of my weekly weekend highlights, because I thorougly enjoy it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/">The Escapist</a>—a weekly <em>free</em> magazine about gaming culture. Not about reviews and previews and what’s hot etc, mind you. The magazine approaches gaming on a more psychological, human, laid-back level. Each issue has a particular topic, and you can read it either on the web or print it out (beautiful PDF version!) and read it on the subway. Which I do every now and then. Quite frankly, it’s a magazine so good I would actually buy it. Or subscribe to it.</li>
<li>I stopped reading <a href="http://pm-magazin.de/">PM Magazin</a> a short while ago, after getting it monthly for a few years. Somehow it doesn’t click with me anymore. Someone once described it to me as <em>“Bunte für Intellektuelle”</em>, which I found funny, while at the same time think it’s slightly incorrect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that’s it. I toss the topic on to <a href="http://mornography.de/">Hendrik</a>, <a href="http://mikewest.org/">Mike</a>, <a href="http://nureinhobby.org/jeck/">jeck</a>, <a href="http://zhaneel69.livejournal.com/">Zhaneel</a>, <a href="http://beryllia.livejournal.com/">Beryl</a> and - as an experiment - <a href="http://antigames.de/">the funky folks at Antigames.de</a>. Go!</p>

<p>Danke dafür.</p>
<p>Aber das kann ich Euch auch morgen persönlich sagen, wenn ich das an sich coole, aber leider funktionsunfähige Gerät zurückbringe, um mir Ersatz zu holen, den ich mir im Laden vorführen lasse.</p>

			 <p>I’ve <a href="http://tumblr.zottmann.org/">started a tumble log</a> the other day. I consider it an experiment; first of all, <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> is an <em>exquisite</em> service with a whole lot of potential. It serves as an extremely easy and comfortable tool to link all the new doodads, gimmicks, funny pictures and clever quotes I find on the Intertron.</p>
<p>And secondly, all the cool cats are doing it already, so there.</p>
<p>Thus, for the time being, I will do <a href="http://www.mornography.de/2007/04/05/huch/">what Hendrik did</a> and deactivate the daily automated splicing of my new <a href="http://del.icio.us/Carlo/">del.icio.us links</a> and blog-worthy <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/czottmann/">Flickr pictures</a> into my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Carlo">tail -f carlo.log RSS feed</a>, and opt for Tumblr raking them in automatically. In addition I’ll throw in the gems I found while reading feeds in Google Reader! What a deal!</p>
<p>That means if you want to keep track of the little things I see and find, those which do not warrant a blog post on their own here, take a look <a href="http://tumblr.zottmann.org/">tail -f carlo.tumblr</a>. Yes, I know the name is lame, screw you! :p There is <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/CarloTumblr">an RSS feed, too</a>.</p>

			 <p>Good entertainment. They’ve painted some grand pictures there; I’ve enjoyed the visual style. Loved the presentation; the fighting scenes with the slow/full motion switches were very well done. Featured strong women, always a plus.</p>
<p>Wasn’t as visionary as the hype wanted me to believe, but it has most certainly set a new high in action cinematography for me—it’s as much a visual milestone as <em>The Matrix</em> was back then. (Other than that you can’t compare those two flicks.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0920992/">Faramir</a> didn’t really fit in, I think. Good performance, but his blond hair stood out a bit too much.</p>

<p>Now, after taking a long, hard look at the various doodads sitting around the TV, which are burning energy in standby mode all day long, I’ve decided to introduce a master/slave extension lead to the mix. So these days, when I turn off the TV, the six other machines around it (gaming consoles, sound system,
DVR etc.) are <em>completely</em> turned off as well automatically. It’s pretty neat,
albeit not perfect yet.</p>
<p>And according to my calculations the 25€ I spent on the extension lead will be paid for by the energy bill savings within less than a year.</p>

<p><strong>Troubled languages.</strong> English is degrading each and every day, <a href="http://doodleplex.com/glassmaze/?p=458">says Glass Maze’s lapsed cannibal</a> in a amusing, yet angry rant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I often find myself in meetings where the English language is beaten,
burned, shat upon, drawn-and-quartered, and finally twisted into a monstrous parody of itself, then slapped onto a powerpoint slide and projected onto a wall, where its shame and ignominy are visible to all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And you know what? He might be right, but I believe <em>blood would come out of his ears on a daily basis</em>, if he were a caring German listening to his native language. Don’t know what I mean? Take what he said, double it, and imagine parts of any given sentence being peppered with English/German <em>halfbreeds</em> constantly.</p>
<p>I notice that I, personally, see a decline in the quality of <em>my</em> German &ndash;
which is my very own tongue, mind you &ndash;, due to the fact that I speak English half of the time for a good number of years by now. I switch between the languages without effort, sometimes in the middle of a sentence, and &ndash; worst of all &ndash; interchange English and German words rather frequently. Shame on me.</p>
<p>But the longer I think about it, the more I wonder whether this is a price we have to pay for globalization… Remember <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/">Blade Runner</a> with his “gutter speak”? Just thinking out loud.</p>

<p><strong>Dell IdeaStorm.</strong> Dell.com’s <a href="http://www.dellideastorm.com/">new suggestions site</a> kind of <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/">looks familiar</a>.

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I like their web-based office tools, even though I don’t use them regularly. They’re well done, no doubt about it. But by now I find it somewhat unnerving that <em>every single time</em> Google launches <em>something</em>, it is hailed as the holy grail of the intarwebs.</p>

<p>Arthas was the son of King Terenas Menethil, ruler of Lordaeron. As a youth,
he trained in the art of combat and joined the Silver Hand, a group of paladins. He became known for his exploits in battle. He also briefly dallied with a young mage named Jaina Proudmoore, but it didn’t work out because long-
distance things never end well. They decided to remain friends, which is as big a sign of impending doom as one can get.</p>

			 <p>The good fight against blog comment spam continues—I’ve added <a href="http://elliottback.com/wp/archives/2005/10/23/wordpress-hashcash-30-beta/">HashCash</a> to the mix after noticing the Akismet plugin catching up to 250 spam comments <em>per night</em>. Let’s see whether with HashCash this number goes down; after all it is supposed to stop bots, so the comments shouldn’t end up in Akismets queue in the first place. If you have problems posting comments (if you want to comment here for whatever reason… can’t think of anything at the moment),
drop me a line. My mail address can be found around here, you know where to look. <strong>Update:</strong> I deactivated HashCash again. After Akismet had to filter out ~50 spam comments in the last two hours, it became clear to me that HashCash doesn’t help at all. Awesome! :P</p>
<p><strong>Update #2:</strong> It dawned me that pretty much all of my incoming spam is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback">trackbacks</a>, and HashCash doesn’t process those for apparent reasons. Huh.</p>

			 <p>I had the <em>pleasure</em> to watch hordes of co-workers, past and present,
struggling to get through their days without going insane. The lot of them are capable people, but they appear to waste a lot of time (and nerves) by not asking the right questions when it comes to technology. And I am talking here about developers and non-developers.</p>
<p>Also, before I go any further, let me clarify one thing: I am writing this <em>not</em> to tell people they suck, but to share some personal findings and experiences about common pitfalls and how to get around them. I am aware that you can buy books about this topic by the dozen, and I don&rsquo;t want to go into philosophy, so this is merely a list of tiny things that I changed on my machines that had quite an impact on my productivity. Also, all this stuff works <em>for me</em> &ndash; it might not for you. I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>The general idea is to get rid of some obstacles that keep my mind from running like the well-oiled, finetuned, skillfully honed bucket of bolts that it is. This idea is neither new nor original nor mine, but hey, it&rsquo;s good!</p>
<p>So, onwards &ndash; let me share some observations with you.</p>
<h3 id="im-contact-status-notifications-are-evil">IM contact status notifications are EVIL.</h3>
<p>The other day I was sitting in a meeting, watching a presentation, when I noticed the constant <em>barrage</em> of IM presence notifications popping on and off in the lower right corner of the presentation laptop&rsquo;s desktop. Approximately one every 15 seconds. <em>&ldquo;That guy came online&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;The other guy went offline&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;OMG the third guy is out for lunch now&rdquo;</em>. It was hard to follow the presentation, to be honest. The funny thing was that the presenter didn&rsquo;t really seem to notice them anymore. Or didn&rsquo;t care, hard to say. In that case: why did he even turn them on in the first place? Oh, wait, he didn&rsquo;t, the messaging client has them activated by default. <strong>My advice: turn them off NOW.</strong> Usually these things do nothing else than stealing your attention from your actual work, either your conscious or unconscious attention. Seriously, you probably don&rsquo;t need them anyways. If you want to know whether someone is on, just take a peek at the damn contact list, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s there for.</p>
<h3 id="im-new-message-notifications-are-evil">IM new message notifications are EVIL.</h3>
<p>Most IM clients have an in-your-face attitude. When there is a new message coming in, it&rsquo;s slapped across the screen, on top of everything else, stealing the focus. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re typing a mail, looking on your keyboard, as most people do, and a new IM is coming in &ndash; the message window pops up, the cursor is put in the reply box, and you&rsquo;re writing the rest of the sentence (that was supposed to be part of the email) into the messenger window. <strong>My advice:
change that NOW.</strong> My client is configured to get out of my face. When a new message is received, the window is either popping up in the very background of the desktop, not stealing focus, or it is opened minimized in the taskbar.
That&rsquo;s enough. I&rsquo;ll see it soon enough, and it doesn&rsquo;t keep me from working.</p>
<h3 id="im-client-sounds-are-evil">IM client sounds are EVIL.</h3>
<p>Seriously, they might be hilarious at first, but the constant chirping and barking and clingclanging and dingdinging is unnerving. <strong>My advice:
deactivate sounds NOW.</strong> Mostly because you don&rsquo;t want your IM client to steal your attention or your focus, and sounds are the very best way to achieve that. Nice side-effect: your co-workers will start to like you again.</p>
<h3 id="new-mail-notifications-are-evil">New mail notifications are EVIL.</h3>
<p>Many IM or email clients allow you to watch your mailbox, telling you when new mail is coming in. Constantly. That&rsquo;s almost as bad as IM contact status notifications. How the hell are you supposed to follow a train of thought if shit is popping up <em>all the time</em>? Exactly. <strong>My advice: turn them off NOW.</strong>
You have a mail client, you check it every one or two hours anyways, that&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<h3 id="reduce-email-polling-interval">Reduce email polling interval.</h3>
<p>Three words: Information inflow paralysis. I get a few hundred mails per day,
something like 1 mails per minute. Mostly mailing list mails and bug tracker mails. <strong>My advice: Polling for new mails once per hour is enough.</strong> YMMV, of course. You have to answer them at some point, or even read them. At least in my profession (engineering, read: coding and fixing things) I have to do real work somehow, and I won&rsquo;t get anything done if I stare at my inbox all day long.</p>
<p>Now suggesting this I often hear the argument <em>&ldquo;But I am supposed to answer mails right away!&quot;</em>. Really? I mean, <em>really REALLY</em>? I would be surprised. If I had to venture a guess I&rsquo;d say that isn&rsquo;t true for most people. Unless you&rsquo;re working at NORAD and waiting for clearance to bomb Utah or Thuringia from space, it&rsquo;s probably okay to take an hour or two to reply to a new mail.
So what I do is keeping my mail client minimized, and taking a peek every hour.</p>
<h3 id="email-client-use-filters-for-the-love-of-god-use-filters">Email client: Use filters, for the love of God, USE FILTERS.</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, I get hundreds of emails. I&rsquo;d be pulling my hair out if I had to sift through them manually. Therefore, I set up filtering rules in my email client (I use Thunderbird 3alpha, by the way). When new mails are coming in, they are checked against ~3 dozen filters. They are tagged with the name of the mailing list, they are checked for particular keywords and filtered by senders &ndash; and tagged accordingly, too. Once that is done, everything that is tagged is moved <em>out of the inbox</em> into a huge archive. In addition, I have a number of saved searches; one for every mailing list, one for every keyword or topic. I can see on a glimpse how many new mails came in via any given mailing list. I can see on a glimpse whether there are new mails dealing with that particular project XYZ I am working on. <em>But first and foremost, the only stuff left in my inbox is everything that has not been processed, and that&rsquo;s usually the new mail for <strong>me</strong></em>. No bug reports, no mailing list mails, just stuff I should probably read right away. Also, the other mails are sorted into neat piles for easy consumption whenever I have the time. So I can see that the <em>clown-workshop-participants@example-company.com</em> list has 3218 new mails,
but I also know that this is not important and can wait.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the inbox of some of my co-workers, and at any given time they have a few hundreds or (deity forbid) thousands of unsorted mails in there. No kidding. I mean, WTF. How can you not feel totally overwhelmed with that many mails, read or not? It&rsquo;s clogging your mind, get rid of it.</p>
<h3 id="email-client-keep-your-inbox-clean">Email client: Keep your inbox clean.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Read.</li>
<li>Answer/process.</li>
<li>Tag and archive / move to related folder.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your inbox is full, even with emails already answered, then your unconsciousness thinks something like <em>&ldquo;OMG more work&rdquo;</em> and blocks your thoughts. No good.</p>
<h3 id="email-client-use-threading">Email client: use threading.</h3>
<p>Threaded view is great since you don&rsquo;t lose the context of a discussion. It&rsquo;s a matter of taste, of course. I like it. You might not. Nice side effect: you can collapse threads.</p>
<h3 id="desktop-delete-all-redundant-and-useless-icons">Desktop: Delete all redundant and useless icons.</h3>
<p>If you open your laptop and see ~200 icons on your desktop, and you don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s too much, you&rsquo;re crazy. (I&rsquo;m not making this up, I&rsquo;ve seen desktops like that.) Get help. Without knowing your desktop, I&rsquo;m sure you could delete half of it without missing anything afterwards.</p>
<h3 id="sum-up">Sum up.</h3>
<p>These are just a few things that come to my mind. I know that thinking about setting up 20 or 30 different email client filter rules might be a bit off-
putting, but think about it &ndash; it might be worth it. You might be spending an hour or two, but imagine the benefits: a clean inbox, more room to breathe,
less crap your eyes see and which causes your to ponder all the time,
knowingly or unknowingly.</p>
<p>All of these things work for me personally. As I&rsquo;ve said, YMMV. But I found that jumping through one or two hoops, like reconfiguring your IM client or adjusting your email client, was a good investment of time that helped me deal with all the information that comes my way and the amount of work in front of me.</p>
<p>Maybe it works for you, too. Who knows.</p>

			 <p>Vor ein paar Wochen hat ein &ldquo;Discount-Bäcker&rdquo; in Trudering aufgemacht. Ich vermutete, dass es sich um einen &ldquo;keine Bedienung, niedrige Preise&rdquo;-Laden handelt, war mir aber nicht sicher.</p>
<p>Gestern abend sitz ich im Bus, auf dem Weg heim, und seh' durchs Dunkel das erleuchtete Schaufenster. Letzteres mit einem neuen, handgeschriebenen Vermerk.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Kaffe + Crosso 1.50€&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>Was zum Teufel ist ein &ldquo;Crosso&rdquo;? Und &ldquo;Kaffe&rdquo;? Huh? Verwirrung.</p>
<p>Heute morgen hab ich dann mal reingeschaut und mit der Chefin geplaudert. Die Geschichte nahm dann innerhalb von 15 Sekunden Züge einer Ohnsorg-Theater-
Aufführung an.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ich: &ldquo;Guten Morgen, ich hätte gern das, was Sie da im Fenster bewerben… was
auch immer das ist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chefin: &ldquo;Haha… Kaffee und Croissant. Ist falschgeschrieben, oder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ich: &ldquo;Ich fürchte ja. Aber hey, es hat mich neugierig gemacht!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chefin: &ldquo;Ich weiss nicht genau, wie man ‘Croissant' schreibt. Hey
[Angestellte], wie schreibt man ‘Croissant'?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angestellte: &ldquo;Puh… äh… ich weiss es nicht aus dem Kopf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chefin: &ldquo;Ah, okay. [Angestellter], komm mal her. Hier sind Stifte, schreib
das Angebot nochmal richtig auf die Scheibe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angestellter: &ldquo;Wieso, was ist falsch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chefin: &ldquo;Da steht ‘Crosso', das stimmt nicht. Und ‘Kaffe' ist auch nicht
richtig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angestellter: &ldquo;Woher soll ich denn jetzt wissen, wie man das schreibt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ich: (etwas ungläubig) &ldquo;C-r-o-i-s-s-a-n-t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angestellter: &ldquo;Was? Nochmal, langsamer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ich: &ldquo;C-r-o-i-s-s-a-n-t. Aber dort an der Theke stehen ca. 5 verschiedene
Preisschilder, auf denen es steht. Nehmen Sie doch einfach eins von denen und
schreiben Sie es ab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angestellter: (murmelt, nimmt die Stifte, geht raus und beginnt zu
schreiben)</p>
<p>Chefin: &ldquo;… Ey, das ist falsch! Nimm halt das Schild!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Der Kaffee war übrigens okay, und das Croissant auch ganz gut.</p>

			 <p>Friday I finally got my new machine delivered to my doorstep: <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">24’’ iMac, Core 2 Duo, 2GB RAM, 7600GT</a>.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2007/02/imac2.jpg" alt="iMac"> First impression: it’s huge. Really huge. <em>“A couple of smaller iMacs are orbiting it!”</em>-huge. But very shiny. My 20” Dell flatscreen is still sitting next to it, looking small.</p>
<p>The transition from the Mac mini to the new box was uneventful, almost <em>too easy</em>, if there is such a thing. Next I moved a few gigabytes of porn data over from my PC, the 250GB drive took it with a mere <em>shrug</em>, as expected.</p>
<p>I also installed World of Warcraft/Burning Crusade, since it’s the only game I have lying around for OSX at the moment. (Which reminds me, I also have
<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/uruonlineagesbeyondmyst/">Uru</a> and <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/warcraft3reignofchaos/">Warcraft III</a> and should probably take them for a spin as well.)</p>
<p>Short verdict: <em>frickin’ sweet</em>. 1920×1200px, all settings cranked to max,
glow enabled, 16xAF—I get 30-60fps all the time, no matter where I am. One thing that for some reason doesn’t work, tho, is FSAA. Apparently the 7600GT doesn’t do FSAA in WoW, but it’s a known problem, and I hope they’ll fix it at some point. That said, it’s not like the lack of anti-aliasing is really apparent. :)</p>
<p>Also, the box doesn’t really break a sweat running <em>anything</em>. For example,
the CPUs hover around 20% while playing WoW. Even when converting AVI videos to something my iPod can handle it was blazingly fast, yet quiet and still responsive, the way it should be. The difference between a single G4 Mac mini and a Core 2 Duo iMac 24” is nothing short of breathtaking. (If it wasn’t, I’d be seriously disappointed anyways.) It performs admirably.</p>
<p>I named it <a href="http://familyguy.wikia.com/wiki/Rupert">Rupert</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://zottmann.org/2007/01/23/020000.html">Social whitelisting with OpenID, my take</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://zottmann.org/2007/01/23/020000.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2007-01-23 02:00:00 &#43;0200">Jan 23, 2007</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When I read <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2007/Jan/22/whitelisting/">Simon’s proposal about social whitelisting with OpenID</a> this morning, I was immediately intrigued by the idea. Basically, he’s suggesting that by whitelisting trusted OpenIDs, sharing these lists among peers, and using them to decide whether to place a new comment on your own blog in a moderation queue or not, a group of people could build a working, trust-based protection against comment spam(mers).</p>
<p>Go read. It’s good stuff. I’ll wait.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Welcome back.</p>
<p>Now, I was pondering this while walking home from the bus. Mainly, I was thinking how to make this approach technically feasible. I doubt anyone would be willing to manually collect all the whitelists of his peers by hand. Well,
at least <em>I</em> wouldn’t be. So, a polling mechanism would be needed.</p>
<p>Let’s say you have a cronjob gizmo that polls your peers’ whitelists once a day. I think in order to end up with a working implementation that doesn’t require much work or time once built, we’d need to come up with a standardized URL scheme. This would allow for simple inclusion of new trusted sources. For example, my whitelist would be accessible under
<code>[http://carlo.zottmann.org/trust/whitelist/][2]</code> (example, my OpenID is
<code>carlo.zottmann.org</code>, but the URL is not working right now). Yours would be stored at <code>http://[OpenID]/trust/whitelist/</code>.</p>
<p>Now if I decide to trust another netizen’s judgement when it comes to other people, I’d simply add her/his OpenID (for example,
<code>[http://my.open.id.omg/][3]</code>) to my imaginary polling mechanism, which would know where to look for the whitelist—at <code>http://[OpenID]/trust/whitelist/</code>, in our case that’d mean <code>[http://my.open.id.omg/trust/whitelist/][4]</code>.</p>
<p>Of course this implies that you have added <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/01/03/OpenID-for-non-SuperUsers">OpenID delegation</a> to your blog/site. Now if you move to another ID provider, you’d simply adjust the delegation, your ID would stay the same. As would the whitelist URL. You could even place on another machine, as long as the URL remains the same—<code>http://[OpenID]/trust/whitelist/</code>.</p>
<p>Now, when you decide I’m totally out of my mind after making a few bad choices about who to include in my whitelist, you’d simply “unsubscribe” from my whitelist, and that’d be it. On the next caching run our imaginary mechanism would weed out my list of trusted OpenIDs.</p>
<p>Another idea would be something like feed autodiscovery, but for whitelists,
although I’m not so sure about that. This would probably allow for more flexible implementation; then again I don’t find the idea of adding the line
<code>&amp;amp;lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;text/plain&quot; href=&quot;http://carlo.zottmann.org/trust/whitelist/&quot;/&amp;amp;gt;</code> (example) to my header each and every time I decide to try a new Wordpress theme appealing.
(Maybe I should switch to another blogging engine, but yeah… you know how it is.) A simple standardized URL would be, well, simpler. Of course that’s a personal opinion. <strong>Update:</strong> Mike is absolutely right (see comments), it’s silly to mention delegation while turning down the idea of whitelist autodiscovery. I somehow still prefer the notion of having a default location.</p>
<p>Well, it’s just an idea. I’m probably not the first to think about it, but as I’ve said, I promised myself I’d write about those things this year, instead of just mumbling inaudible while riding the bus home.</p>
<p>Opinions?</p>

			 <p>Apparently, for whatever reason, people came here and read my mad rant about
<a href="/2007/01/19/the-dawn-of.html">Jabber, OpenID And &ldquo;teh shiny&rdquo;</a>. To be perfectly honest, I was somewhat surprised about that. Anyways, allow me to address some responses.</p>
<p><a href="http://saint-andre.com/blog/2007-01.html#2007-01-19T12:37">Peter Saint-Andre answered with some interesting numbers.</a> (He is Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/">XMPP Standards Foundation</a>, Director of Standards at <a href="http://www.jabber.com/">Jabber Inc.</a>, Chair of the XMPP Council, and managing editor of the standards process followed by the XMPP Standards Foundation.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]here are 40-50 million people using Jabber technologies these days, but most of them probably don’t even know it since they think they’re using Google Talk, Live Journal Talk, Chikka, IM services from NTT or BellSouth or Gizmo or whomever, presence services like Jaiku and Twitter, etc. Or they work for FedEx or HP or Adobe or EDS or just about any Wall Street bank and those companies all use Jabber for their in-house IM service. Or they’re in the Marines or work for some other government agency that has deployed Jabber. Or they’re using something that doesn’t even look like IM because it’s in fact a network monitoring service or workflow system or whiteboarding app that just happens to use the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol to send around some XML in real time. Or. Well, you get the picture. Jabber/XMPP is fundamentally infrastructure, not a shiny client. Think HTTP, not Firefox.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very good point, and very good numbers. (Seriously, I am actually, truly wow’ed.) And I apologize for me not mentioning the infrastructure part. It is part of XMPP, of course, but I was talking about wide-spread adoption of XMPP/Jabber by the average IM user. XMPP is a superior protocol in my eyes,
and I was wondering why it didn’t take the <em>public</em> IM landscape by storm.
That said, as impressive these numbers are, in my eyes corporate or governmental clients and services really count, mostly because in these cases the employer (be it a company or a country) <em>dictate</em> which client to use. Now if all these people would use XMPP IM clients at home as well, then that would really make a splash.</p>
<p>Now I was wondering why not everyone is using an IM client that uses this superior protocol, and the reason is: there is no client that does really impress the public. Now, please, don’t get me wrong: There are a lot of good Jabber clients out there that appeal to devs and geeks. Hell, I’ve used a fair share of them myself. Some of them are pretty damn cool, others not so much,
and that’s okay. But now, even if you kick and scream about the awesomeness of IM client XYZ, the question remains:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Why is Joe A. IMuser still using ICQ &amp; Co. instead of a good, slick Jabber client?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Think about it. We’re talking about a good selling point that is heard by the un-geeky masses.</p>
<p><a href="http://philwilson.org/blog/">Phil Wilson</a> asked <a href="/2007/01/19/the-dawn-of.html#comment-5135">in the comments</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenID is for logging in to things. I look forward to your suggestion of a killer app for “logging in to things”. Also, your [..] comparison is fatally flawed. An IM infrastructure and protocol has a default application, an IM server and client, OpenId has, what? a login form?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was under the impression that it was an identity management platform/protocol. But in the end, yes, that means it is for logging in to things. ;) But as I’ve said, the “killer application” for OpenID could be something quite simple. For example, being an integral part of the Wordpress standard package so every WP installation would allow OpenID authentication by default. Yes, no, maybe? Well, I don’t know…</p>
<p>Really, I don’t have (m)any answers. I was just going with my new years resolution to blog more about what I think about. :)</p>
<p>Anyways: In the end, I think <a href="http://www.mikewest.org/">Mike</a> sums it up best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]n short, the public has no imagination when it comes to protocols. The fact that Skype took off has nothing at all to do with the backend communication layer, except insofar as that layer was better at getting through firewalls than anything else on the market. People used the protocol,
not because of the protocol, but because of the feature the protocol enabled.
When you say that Jabber will take off as soon as it has a client with some killer features, I don’t think that actually says anything about Jabber itself: you’re simply arguing for a shinier client. If Y! implemented the killer “Smilmiis” (How’s that for a name? :) ) in Messenger, people would use it. If AOL did the same, people would use it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well put, thank you. (The “mi”s in “S<strong>mi</strong>l<strong>mi</strong>is” stand for &ldquo;Mike&rdquo;, I believe.)</p>
<p>On a personal note: I know that I often lack the ability to <em>pinpoint</em> what I am pondering, or where I am going with a rant. I know that. I hope that more frequent blogging and “public pondering” will help me improve that ability.</p>
<p>Also, I might be totally off my rocker. That’s why I tagged it with “rant”.</p>

			 <p>I am thinking about my <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/linkblog/">linkblog</a> for a few days now, and whether to continue it or not.</p>
<p>On one hand, it <em>is</em> kind of comfortable to just <a href="http://www.google.com/help/reader/sharing.html">share items in Google Reader</a> or to just store another bookmark using <a href="http://myweb.yahoo.com">Yahoo!

<p>On the other hand, I think the <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/tag/post-it.html">Post Its</a> are the better format. It takes more time (and more work, even) to compile them over the course of a day, but I am more flexible in how to present them. Plus they are part of my main syndication feed.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Bye, linkblog. It’s been a nice experiment.</p>
<p>PS: That also means the related syndication feed will be deleted as well, of course.</p>

			 <p>I am planning to write a more or less full rundown of the year past for a few weeks by now, and I finally faced the fact that it won’t happen anytime soon—i.e. probably never. So I’ve decided to simply jot down some corner stones of a year that was strange, cool, tiresome and good to me.</p>
<ol>
<li>Proudest overall moment: Standin on ~80m2 of laminate flooring after installing it. I did it all by myself within 2 full days; yes, you can see it, it’s not perfect, but I installed it with my own hands. Great feeling. (I hardly couldn’t move for four days afterwards… bygones.)</li>
<li>Best job moments: shaking hands with the European VP after he told me my contract would be changed into a fulltime employment. A few weeks later I got the promotion mentioned when I had started the job. (It’s been an awesome ride right from the start, and it got …awesomer.)</li>
<li>Most exhausting moment: The moment the movers were out of the door, after they moved all our stuff to the new house. This was the culmination of roughly 10 months of planning, working, renovating and <em>doing stuff</em>. The minute it was <em>over</em>, we were happy, but done with.</li>
<li>Best gaming moment: standing/sitting in line for a Wii for a few hours. Silly idea, but it’s been a funny morning.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s hard to summarize a whole year; silly, actually. Still, when looking back I have a wee bit of a hard time to remember what happened. Mostly because it’s filled with so many things and events, in my personal life, in my career, then there was the whole house thing… I didn’t blog much, so that is not helping either.</p>
<p>(But realizing it makes for a good new years resolution. Scribbling down seamingly irrelevant observations, ideas and/or events means externalizing one’s memories. I should remember that more often. Note to self: in 2007,
write at least one blog entry per week.)</p>
<p>Still, while I am amazed 2006 flew by so fast (apparently), I don’t think I am missing much by not remembering. The overall feelings when trying to reach back in my memories are those of being incredibly busy, of being incredibly tired and of happiness.</p>
<p>A good year, then.</p>
<p>What were your best moments in 2006? Feel like sharing? In this case—<strong>tag,
you’re it!</strong> ;)</p>

			 <p>The aforementioned tech article <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/01/03/yui-greasemonkey/">is available now on YUIblog.com</a>! It’s explaining a way to use the excellent <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI library</a> in <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org">Greasemonkey</a>
scripts. I’m sure that this approach is neither the perfect nor the only solution to achieving YUI/Greasemonkey integration, but it works for me and I thought sharing can’t hurt.</p>
<p>Well, the article is <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/01/03/yui-greasemonkey/">here</a>, and the example script can be downloaded <a href="http://gist.github.com/297364">from this very site here</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few weeks ago I was minding my own business at <a href="http://de.yahoo.com">work</a>, writing a
<a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org">Greasemonkey</a> script to solve a problem I had, when I noticed that apparently I had found the solution for a GM problem that not only I had but a number of other people as well. So, I tinkered and tinkered and tinkered some more and discovered that I had managed to write something fairly wicked that I had never seen before.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to my own code, I always tend to be somewhat cautious about getting too excited about it. I myself might find it pretty cool and elegant,
but I always have the nagging feeling that I might have overlooked some glaring problem or messed up otherwise. (Interestingly enough this behaviour surfaced around the time I started working at Yahoo!. Heh. That’s what happens when you know there <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">are</a> <a href="http://simonwillison.net/">real</a> <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/">top</a> <a href="http://lerdorf.com/bio.php">dogs</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Schachter">around</a>.
Honestly, we pack some serious talent around the world, which can feel a bit frightening at times.)</p>
<p>Anyways, I finished it up and posted it on one of our internal mailing lists,
and after getting back some very encouraging comments I decided to show it to
<a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-JG9noGk0aa9kLMDBru_y9a2uxmo-">Eric</a>, one of our major Javascript famosos.</p>
<p>Turns out he found it interesting enough to ask me whether I want to write an article for one of our public dev blogs. Holy crap.</p>
<p>So yesterday I finished a working example, and today I’ve submitted my article. When all goes well, and after some (hopefully) serious proof-reading
(to make sure I don’t make a fool out of myself after all), it will be presented to the interwebs.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t want to tell you where or what, mostly because I am getting increasingly paranoid about bragging. But quite frankly, I am amazed I made it this far, and even if it isn’t published after all, at least it was considered interesting enough to let me take a shot there.</p>
<p>And for me, that is quite something.</p>

			 <p>A <a href="http://content.techrepublic.com.com/2348-10877_11-5911196-17.html">dirty, dirty, dirty keyboard</a> can be cleaned <em>thoroughly</em> easily, it doesn’t necessarily have to be thrown away—you can reuse it! Here’s how.</p>
<p>Unplug the keyboard. Then disassemble it, usually that means taking out the screws in the back and ending up with one plastic board holding all the keys and the (more or less) fancy casing. If the cable can be detached, even better.</p>
<p>Now, take the key board and the casing and put it in a dishwasher. Put it in an upright position. Close the dishwasher and let it do its dirty work.</p>
<p>When the dishwasher is done, take both parts of the keyboard and put them in a dry place. Again, in an upright position. Usually leaning them against a closet works fine. Leave them there for one or two days so the remaining water can drip out or evaporate. The longer, the better. It’s better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Once the parts are dry again, reassemble the keyboard and plug it in. Usually
(see disclaimer below) you’ll have a clean and working keyboard now. Even all the <a href="http://www.inktank.com/AT/index.cfm?nav=220">board chow</a> is gone! Splendid.</p>
<p>If it doesn’t work correctly, it’s probably not entirely dry yet. Just let it dry for another day or so and try again.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I’ve followed this procedure two times by now. The first time with an Apple Keyboard. No disassembling necessary (or possible). Worked fine. Second time just last week with a no-brand ergonomic PC keyboard. Both times I was successful. Your mileage may vary, and I won’t take any responsibility.</p>

			 <p>So… [Heroes][http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/]. I watched the pilot and the first episodes over the last few days, and to be honest—I couldn’t stop. It’s all around a great show so far,
from story (great) to writing (great) to acting (great) to everything else
(great).</p>
<p>![Heroes: Mohinder][https://attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2006/12/hro_1001_057.jpg]</p>
<p>Somewhere, I read something about the show along the lines <em>“X-Men, before they became X-Men”</em>. And actually, it’s not far from the truth. The story (or stories) are those of ordinary people today who discover they can do extraordinary things; they are the next steps in human evolution.</p>
<p>Indeed, this sounds a lot like X-Men. But here they are, without a professor in a wheelchair, without a “School for the Gifted Youngsters”, without an idea what’s going on with them… they are alone, unsure what to do, how to continue their lives. But in the end, these are everyday people. There’s the Japanese worker drone who learns he can bend time and space, the drug-addicted painter with precognitive powers, the young man who believes he can fly, the unbreakable teenage girl who just wants to be like everyone else…</p>
<p>And there’s the Indian genetics scientist who figured out a way to identify them, is murdered, and his son who wants to find out who killed him, and in the process picks up his father’s work.</p>
<p>It’s somewhat hard to talk about any given episode of “Heroes” without handing out spoilers by the dozen. So, if you haven’t already done so, make sure to watch it, right from the beginning. Each episode has a cliffhanger that had me staring at the screen in disbelief. Oh yes, it’s that good.</p>
<p>It might not be for everyone, true. But if you have a knack for superhero stories or X-Men (the movies), you will probably love “Heroes”. In that case make sure to visit [the official NBC site][http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/], too—it’s quite good, with a lot of extras that are worth checking out. I believe you can even watch full episodes there.</p>

			 <p>Heute auf dem Heimweg traf ich an der Bushaltestelle einen mir unbekannten jungen Mann. Ungefähr Mitte 20, geistig behindert, sehr freundlich, trug ein Spielzeugstethoskop um den Hals und einen Spielzeug-Erste-Hilfe-Koffer in der Hand.</p>
<p>“Ich arbeite hier!” sagte er zur Begrüßung und zeigte nicht ohne Stolz über die Schulter.</p>
<p>“Hallo.” antwortete ich ihm. “Ehrlich? Wo denn?”</p>
<p>“Da, beim Roten Kreuz!” und grinste.</p>
<p>“Oh, da helfen Sie dann Kranken?” – “Ja!” – “Klasse, find ich gut.” entgegnete ich und grinste zurück.</p>
<p>Wir unterhielten uns dann noch eine knappe Minute, bis mein Bus kam und wir uns gegenseitig ein schönes Wochenende wünschten. Er fands gut, dass er es jemandem mitteilen konnte, der ihn nicht wie einen Deppen behandelte—während mir klarwurde, dass wir anscheinend die eine oder andere Sache gemein haben.
Wir mögen leicht unterschiedlich verkabelt sein im Kopf, okay. Aber sonst?</p>
<p>Ich bin mir durchaus bewußt, dass er vermutlich kein ausgebildeter Mediziner war, natürlich. Aber offensichtlich hatte er ein Interesse und auch Freude daran, der Welt mitzuteilen, dass er… ja, was eigentlich? Wirklich dort arbeitete? Die Leute beim Roten Kreuz besucht hat? Dort behandelt wurde und die Idee gut fand, Arzt zu sein?</p>
<p>Ich weiss es nicht. Ich weiss nur, dass ich die gleiche Begeisterung, die er ausstrahlte, auch schon öfters in mir hatte. Zum Beispiel, als ich meine letzten Vorstellungsgespräche “gewonnen” habe. Oder feststellte, dass ich etwas kann, von dem ich nicht wusste, dass ich es kann. Oder mal wieder irgendein Problem besiegt habe.</p>
<p>Echte Freude, das war es, was ich da sah. Ansteckende Freude. Die Gründe dafür kenne ich nicht. Aber das vermindert die Erfahrung nicht. Ich kenne den Mann nicht, und ich bild mir nicht ein, dass wir jetzt Freunde sind und ich mit allen geistig Behinderten voll total <em>tight</em> bin und so. Aber so klein und unbedeutend die Begegnung am Ende auch war, so hat sie mich doch zumindest für heute ein wenig positiv beeinflußt. Wer weiss, ihn eventuell auch.</p>
<p>Und das ist doch schonmal was. Gute Nacht.</p>

			 <p>Am Samstag war ich mit meiner Holden mal wieder im Kino, es lief <a href="http://de.movies.yahoo.com/s/scoop-der-knueller/index-2109924.html">‘Scoop – Der Knüller’ von Woody Allen</a>—durchaus heiter! Gut, Woody Allen muss man mögen (was bei uns beiden eigentlich nicht zutrifft), der Film hat aber durchaus seine Momente, was allerdings sowohl an der eigentlichen Geschichte als auch am Ensemble liegt. Hugh Jackman, Scarlet Johansson… Der zerknitterte Herr Allen hat zwar auch ein paar ziemlich gute Zeilen (<em>&ldquo;Ich wurde im hebräischen Glauben erzogen, bin dann aber zum Narzissmus konvertiert&rdquo;</em>), nervt auf Dauer aber doch sehr durch das typische, bemühte Woody-Allen-Auftreten.</p>
<p>Allerdings muss man zu seiner Verteidigung vorbringen, dass er kein echter Schauspieler ist. Mehr ein Darsteller. Der Tom Cruise der psychotischen Elite, sozusagen.</p>
<p>Wie dem auch sei, der Film war nett, wir hatten Spaß. Mehr hatte ich auch nicht erwartet, daher passt das.</p>

			 <p>I am one of the &ldquo;if you want to do it, do it right&rdquo; school. I try to make it apply to everything. This is the reason why I am kind of ticked off when I hear people say things like <em>&ldquo;Oh my Gosh!&quot;</em> or <em>&ldquo;Jeeebus!&quot;</em>. Anyways, this
&ldquo;conversation&rdquo; occured two minutes ago in our office:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A (female): &ldquo;Fudge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>me: &ldquo;The word is &lsquo;fuck&rsquo;, not &lsquo;fudge&rsquo;. Curse properly, woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A: &ldquo;Fudge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>me: &ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A: &ldquo;Fudge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>me: &ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A: &ldquo;Guys, is it &lsquo;fudge&rsquo; or &lsquo;fuck&rsquo;? Hey, M, &lsquo;fudge&rsquo; or &lsquo;fuck&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>M: &ldquo;Is that an offer?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point everyone burst into laughter. I love this place.</p>

			 <p>When <a href="http://www.mornography.de">Hendrik</a> dropped <a href="http://myeve.eve-online.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=403">a few</a> <a href="http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&amp;threadID=430673">bomb shells</a> about the upcoming <a href="http://www.eve-online.com/news/newsOfEve.asp?newsID=380">EVE expansion</a>, I was feeling a bit unsure at first. On the one hand, I love playing with him. (Yes, I know how this sounds.) Plus, EVE consumed quite a bit of my time in the past; actually I dropped out and in a few times by now right from the beginning.</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2006/11/160x600_01.jpg" alt="EVE Online">On the other hand, my relationship with EVE was always somewhat …abusive; I wanted to like EVE, I actually still do, but she kept hitting me over and over again. Mostly with boredom, while at the same time flashing off some nasty (the good kind).</p>
<p>I always <em>felt</em> like there was much love just around the corner, but in the end it boiled down to doing endless cargo runs, spending mindnumbing hours mining asteroids or quickly dying at the hands of some over-equipped,
merciless (and most likely also bored) ass enemy player.</p>
<p>(Let me tell you: after doing endless cargo runs or spending mindnumbing hours mining asteroids, dying quickly at the hands of some over-equipped, merciless
(and most likely also bored) ass enemy player is to fun what a McNugget is to a real chicken.)</p>
<p>Nonetheless—I loved how EVE doesn’t put silly limitations on you. It just doesn’t. There this huge, vast playing field, waiting for players to fill it,
and I always just loved the <em>feeling</em> of having no limits. Trading? There.
Fighting? There (alright, point’n’click). Playing the stock market? There.
Auction house? There. Shiny things? You bet. Skill trees, warfare, money making, team play? They got you covered.</p>
<p>In the end, tho, it always ended with me looking for a good corporation to join. I was looking for a casual outfit. The problem with that? A casual outfit/corporation probably won’t cut it. If you want to play with the big boys, you have to put in some real effort. But sorry, I already do have a job,
I am looking for a <em>game</em>. I doubt you can make a difference (or play a nice,
fun game) when you’re on your own. So I couldn’t find a good corp, got bored or frustrated, and left. Then wait a few months, see something shiny, let the
“wounds” heal, forget, rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>And now they dangle <a href="http://www.eve-online.com/features/Revelations/">Revelations</a> before my watering eyes, and the more I read about it, the more I feel my weakness grow. Damn you, <a href="http://www.mornography.de">Mans</a>! God, I hate you. :P</p>
<p>Anyways, the expansion is supposed to be out tomorrow. And the <a href="http://www.eve-online.com/features/Revelations/">feature list</a> and what the <a href="http://myeve.eve-online.com/devblog.asp">devs are blogging</a> is mouth-watering. Oh my.</p>
<p>Are some of you playing EVE? I told you what I was looking for. Are there any companies willing to show two, somewhat capable pilots (who actually still have some funds left from the past) what EVE feels like if you have a bigger crew to roll with? Hypothetically speaking, of course. I still don’t know whether I will reactivate my account.</p>
<p>EVE, baby, I might be coming back. Will you promise not to hit me again if I do?</p>

			 <p>Well, the <a href="http://g-blog.net/user/Gossip/entry/32686">decision has been made</a>—it certainly feels weird.</p>
<p>The nice (?) side effect is my newly written <a href="http://docs.g-blog.net/code/wordpress/rss_2_plus_blogcomments.phps">Wordpress importer for RSS 2.0 and Blogcomments Module support</a> (catchy name). Download it, put it in your WP root folder in /wp-admin/import/ and rename it to rss_2_plus_blogcomments.php. Then run the import from your WP dashboard,
that’s all there is to do. Use it, abuse it, spread it, have fun.</p>
<p>Which reminds me: why is the original WP 2.0 RSS importer so freaking braindead?! And people—XML parsing with <em>regular expressions</em>? As part of the official WP package? Give me a break, really. This isn’t 1996, bloody hell.</p>
<p>So the new importer uses PHP5 and SimpleXML. It is still very much a hack job,
but at least it’s clean and can deal with CDATA.</p>

			 <p>Pure Ironie; ich mag mal wieder über Verschiedenes schreiben, empfinde
<a href="http://G-Blog.net">G-Blog.net</a>, die Blogging-Site, die ich selbst vor Jahren geschrieben habe, aber mittlerweile als zu beschränkt. Ich fürchte, ich kann nicht mal g’scheit Artikel mit Codebeispielen schreiben &ndash; die Formatierungsroutinen würden die Beispiele zerhackstückeln. An I18N darf ich nicht mal denken &ndash; da kommt mir das kalte Grausen. Plugin-Architektur: Fehlanzeige.</p>
<p>(Die schöne Schlussfolgerung ist, dass ich in der Zeit, seit ich das Teil geschrieben habe, eine <em>Menge</em> gelernt hab—sonst würde ich die Mankos nicht erkennen. Juhu!)</p>
<p>Die eine Lösung wäre ein kompletter Rewrite, aber für den habe ich weder die Zeit noch die Energie.</p>
<p>Die andere &ndash; simplere und (für mich) komfortablere &ndash; Lösung: ein neues Blog,
<em>a clean slate</em>, etwas, das ich nicht erst selbst programmieren muss.
<a href="http://www.mornography.de/">Hendrik</a> empfahl mir dann Wordpress (allerdings mehr aus Pragmatismus denn aus Überzeugung, vermute ich), und hier bin ich.</p>

erarbeite ich mir gerade den Ruf des &ldquo;Beauftragten&rdquo; in Fragen
<a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a>, und ich habe durchaus das Bedürfnis, einige Ideen dem Intertron zu unterbreiten, in der Hoffnung auf Resonanz. Schau’nmermal. Ich weiss noch nicht, wieviel meiner Ideen ich in der freien Wildbahn äußern darf,
heh. ;)</p>
<p>Mit etwas Glück (und der oben erwähnten neugewonnenen Freiheit) schaffe ich eine halbwegs regelmäßige Blog-Frequenz. Ich hab die eine oder andere Idee dafür… Wir werden sehen.</p>

scientist net smarts, I like what he&rsquo;s doing, so I&rsquo;m just pointing you there.
Take a look and tell me what you think.</p>

			 <p>Huh, a few months since my last post, eh? Bummer. Time flies when you&rsquo;re having fun or when you&rsquo;re busy. Or both.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve joined Yahoo! Germany in October the size of my brain has increased a bit, I think. Awesome company. My abilities are useful here, and I&rsquo;m learning quite a bit, which is a great combination in my book. I feel welcome.
During the (rather lengthy) interview process I&rsquo;ve had the feeling they are actually interested in my personality; turns out I was right &ndash; I was in fact tested for &ldquo;group compatibility&rdquo;. (Testing social skills might seem like a no-
brainer, but sadly, in many companies, it isn&rsquo;t…) This resulted in a TTI (time to integration;)) of less than two weeks, meaning after two weeks I didn&rsquo;t feel like the new guy anymore. Very cool.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the job is fun. Lots of work, of course, bugs to fix, new products to launch, things to take care of… I had forgotten how fast a day can go by, hehe.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the mailing lists. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I think there is, in fact,
such a thing as &ldquo;too much mail&rdquo;. But on the other hand a company with employee gaming mailing lists where people discuss WoW gold farming can&rsquo;t be bad, now can it. :P</p>
<p>And… boy, I&rsquo;ve seen things. Interesting projects in the works here. No, can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t tell, sorry. :)</p>
<p>So, to make it short, I&rsquo;m happy, for my work life is finally good again.</p>
<p>That is all. Commence doing your thing.</p>

<p>Then there are so many people. Again, playing in the same timezone as everyone else is really making a difference.</p>
<p>And then the Battlegrounds. I had the opportunity to enter Warsong Gulch
<strong>once</strong> during my time on Argent Dawn US, Alliance side. First of all,
timezones. Then the Alliance/Horde ratio. It always felt like there were like 10 Alliance people per 1 Horde player, which made finding an enemy BGs group somewhat hard.</p>

			 <p>What <a href="http://www.spreading-goodwill.org/show/31">a wonderful little story</a> I&rsquo;ve found over at <a href="http://www.spreading-goodwill.org/">Spreading Goodwill</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE MAYONNAISE JAR AND 2 CUPS OF COFFEE</p>
<p>When things in your life seem almost too much to handle, when 24 hours in a day are not enough, remember the mayonnaise jar and the 2 cups of coffee…</p>
<p>A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls. He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was.</p>
<p>The professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar.
He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was.</p>
<p>The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. He asked once more if the jar was full.</p>
<p>The students responded with a unanimous yes.&quot; The professor then produced two cups of coffee from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar, effectively filling the empty space between the sand.</p>
<p>The students laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the professor, as the laughter subsided, &ldquo;I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life.</p>
<p>The golf balls are the important things &ndash; your family, your children, your health, your friends, and your favorite passions &ndash; things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full.</p>
<p>The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, and your car. The sand is everything else &ndash; the small stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you put the sand into the jar first,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same goes for life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your partner out to dinner. Play another 18. There will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal later.</p>
<p>Take care of the golf balls first &ndash; the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee represented. The professor smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there&rsquo;s always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Out of sheer boredom and the need to do a little PvP research, I recently found myself exploring the Deeprun Tram on a local roleplaying server. With exploration under way, I trekked deep within the confines of the tram and found something rather unusual. What was this standing before me? Two naked night elves of course.</p>

			 <p>2-days shopping spree in order to get dressed for next weekend, where two of our friends are celebrating their wedding.</p>
<p>I just remembered how much I hate buying clothes. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t find anything at all, but I get angry by looking at price tags. A jeans for €189? A <em>jeans</em>? WTF? Is the part where my package is held laced with platinum? It&rsquo;d better be.</p>
<p>Anyways, after visiting the usual suspects (Esprit, H&amp;M, a number of local men outfitters etc.) I&rsquo;ve ended up with a nice combination, new shoes and a few new pieces of leg plate armor jeans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided our friends need no gift anymore. I spent roughly half a day hunting down clothing in order to look good at their wedding weekend, and by the gods, this must count for something, right? That&rsquo;s the greatest gift of all, right? :P</p>

			 <p>So, let&rsquo;s see…</p>
<p>DING &ndash; <a href="http://wow.allakhazam.com/profile.html?258094">Graun</a> reached season 50!</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ve had a very nice conversation with a human priest or warrior (?)
named Ptalaphose about the future of the Alliance.</p>
<p>I met a friendly Night Elf priest named Avaa which in Felwood. Our paths happened to cross a few times again. A overly pleasant lass. She invited me to run a few <a href="http://www.worldofwar.net/cartography/instances/zulfarrak.php">Zul&rsquo;Farrak</a> errands together with her and a few of her friends.
We had a blast. It was a very nice group, two lvl60, two Gahz&rsquo;rilla Scale Armor. Lucky me.</p>
<p>Oh, and I&rsquo;ve even travelled to <a href="http://worldofwar.net/cartography/worldmap/teldrassil.php">Aldrassil</a> and bribed a few younglings to help me start <a href="http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/guildroster.html?guild=Fancy%20Hat%20Brigade&amp;server=Argent%20Dawn">my own guild</a>. Which already has another member, an aspiring young Elven druid named Yule.</p>
<p>Later on I&rsquo;ve convinced those tunnel-dwelling Furbolgs to let me pass from Felwood to Winterspring and Moonglade. Ah, Moonglade… I&rsquo;ve never been there,
can you imagine? I&rsquo;m playing almost since release day, and I had no idea.</p>
<p>All in all it was a rather nice WoW weekend. Lots of casual and even a bit of not-so-casual roleplaying. It&rsquo;s amazing how much difference well-formed sentences and in-character conversations can make. That&rsquo;s why I love Argent Dawn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite nice to have the feeling of not being surrounded by 12-year-olds
(<em>&ldquo;OMGLOLZRUGAYWTF&rdquo;</em>) &mdash; unless the Blackrock server goes down again and Ironforge is overrun by profane Gnome warriors. Which reminds me: I&rsquo;ve reported about a dozen of those since they were making quite a ruckus on Saturday, heavily spamming the chat channels, yelling profanities, cussing at Argent Dawn citizens. Less than 12 hours later I&rsquo;ve got an email from Blizzard support: they are taking actions against those players. Now that&rsquo;s nice, isn&rsquo;t it? Apparently I wasn&rsquo;t the only one the kids&rsquo;ve ticked off. I&rsquo;ve no problems with PvP people using RP servers, for PvP is an integral part of the game, but people with the clear intention of gameplay disruption need punishment.</p>
<p>Anyways… if you happen to run around on Argent Dawn, drop me a line some time,
I&rsquo;d appreciate it. Also, if you&rsquo;re unaffiliated and like cunning head wear,
the <a href="http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/guildroster.html?guild=Fancy%20Hat%20Brigade&amp;server=Argent%20Dawn">Fancy Hat Brigade</a> will be there for you.</p>
<p>(That probably sounds like I&rsquo;ve done nothing but playing WoW the whole weekend, but interestingly enough, that wasn&rsquo;t the case.)</p>

			 <p>We had tickets for the U2 concert here in Munich last night, and we had a blast. Great concert. Bono saved the World two times, I think. :) Unsorted impressions: too much rain (1.5 hours, we were soaking wet), <em>Keane</em> as warming-up band, I stood in line for beer for 45 damn minutes, public transportation was overloaded (&lsquo;twas like Woodstock without the music), nice symbolic slogan (<a href="http://www.atu2.com/view.html?/pix/vertigo/dublin3/sp08.jpg">&ldquo;CoeXisT&rdquo;</a>), too frickin&rsquo; loud.</p>
<p>Seriously, too loud.</p>
<p>Admitted, the U2 boys are a tad older than us, and older people tend to have bad hearing, but we had protective earplugs put in, and only then it was manageable &ndash; so, no. Too loud. My ears still feel like they&rsquo;re under slight pressure.</p>
<p>Other than that: 2 hours of solid U2 goodness. Woooooo! :)</p>

			 <p>We went out to watch <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/mrandmrssmith">Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith</a> last night. Despite the mediocre reviews the flick is receiving, I have to say, it was a two-hour fun ride for me. Pitt and Jolie seemed to have fun in their roles, and it showed.

			 <p>So, over the last few weeks I have posted almost no entries. What can I say,
my life was wicked and weird. We went to Ireland, that was great. Still married, which is awesome. Planning to learn Spanish for no particular reason.
Learning Ruby and Rails and dusting off my Perl skills.</p>
<p>Then of course, major point, I wasn&rsquo;t really happy at work anymore. I tried to keep my mouth shut about the office, which is a clever thing to do, methinks;
still sometimes, the unhappiness showed.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ve decided to do something about it. It took a while to bring that plan to fruition, but it succeeded.</p>
<p>Anyways, I gave in my several-weeks-notice today, which was a rather bizarre feeling after over four years of working there. I still have a few weeks to go there, which is good because there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff to be taken care of. Among them, about 3 weeks of vacation time still to be spent.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s the gist of what&rsquo;s going on at the moment.</p>
<p>Oh, and in October, I start working at Yahoo! Germany. :)</p>

			 <p>Herzlichen Dank an die kreative Seele, die beim Versuch, unser Moped in der Tiefgarage aufzubrechen, eine Feile ins Zündschloss steckte und dabei abbrach.</p>
<p>Herzlichen Dank dafür, dass ich das Ding in gut eineinhalb Stunden wieder herausholen durfte.</p>
<p>Herzlichen Dank dafür, dass ich das in der prallen Sonne machen musste, um überhaupt etwas sehen zu können.</p>
<p>Herzlichen Dank dafür, dass ich dabei das halbe Moped auseinanderbauen musste,
um überhaupt irgendwo heranzukommen.</p>
<p>Herzlichen Dank dafür, dass ich danach feststellen musste, dass das ganze Zündschloss im Eimer ist, und ich weder das Lenkradschloss entriegeln, noch das Moped anlassen kann.</p>
<p>Herzlichen Dank dafür, dass ich jetzt zusehen kann, wie ich das Ding zur Werkstatt bekomme &ndash; das Lenkradschloss ist ja noch verriegelt, und der Lenker steht dabei zur Seite.</p>
<p><strong>Herzlichen Dank.</strong></p>
<p>WAS IST LOS MIT DEN LEUTEN??? Stellt man die Fahrräder ins Fahrradhaus vor der Wohnung, klauen sie einem früher oder später Sattel und Lenker, stellt man das Moped in die Tiefgarage, versuchen sie, es aufzubrechen.

<li>The freedom to study and modify the program for personal use</li>
<li>The freedom to copy the program</li>

<p>So, basically I&rsquo;m looking for something like the GPL without the part that allows users to spread modified versions of it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few of you have done this already, so it&rsquo;s my turn now. :)</p>
<p><em>1. What did you do in 2004 that you&rsquo;d never done before?</em> Driving on the left side of the road for four days straight. Yes, I&rsquo;m talking about our trip to Ireland.</p>
<p><em>2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</em> I didn&rsquo;t have any resolutions. I don&rsquo;t think you need the &ldquo;magic of the new year&rdquo; if you want to accomplish something. Do it or do it not, heck, you might even just try, but you don&rsquo;t need the new year to do it. :)</p>
<p><em>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</em> No. But a number of people are hard at work to make me answer this question with a clear &ldquo;yes&rdquo; next year.</p>
<p><em>4. Did anyone close to you die?</em> No.</p>
<p><em>5. What countries did you visit?</em> Ireland (lovely!). Austria (very briefly).</p>
<p><em>6. What would you like to have in 2005 that you lacked in 2004?</em> Emotional equilibrium. (Yes, I stole that answer from <a href="#">Beryl</a>. So sue me &ndash; she is right and I couldn&rsquo;t have put it any better.)</p>
<p><em>7. What day from 2004 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</em> Oiy. I clearly remember the wedding days of my little sister Claudia and my big semi-
sister Susi. :) And I recall a number of days because I was kicked in the nuts at work, so to speak. Can&rsquo;t remember the dates, tho.</p>
<p><em>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</em> Not quitting my job. Took an aweful lot of self-constraint, but I have to earn money to keep us afloat.</p>
<p><em>9. What was your biggest failure?</em> Not getting an Oscar. Really, no idea. I don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t fail anywhere, but there&rsquo;s nothing standing out.</p>
<p><em>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</em> Not really, apart from the occasional cold.</p>
<p><em>11. What was the best thing you bought?</em> Tough call… Our new leather couch comes to mind. Finally something Dana and I can spread out on at the same time. :)</p>
<p><em>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</em> Jon Stewart, for telling the media about itself.</p>
<p><em>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</em> There are too many fuckers in the company to name, sorry. On a global scale: the US government.
Politically, we&rsquo;re where we were some decades ago. Thankyouverymuch.</p>
<p><em>14. Where did most of your money go?</em> IKEA.</p>
<p><em>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</em> The USA didn&rsquo;t start a real World War in 2004. Yes, Iraq is screwed up, terrorism is on the rise, but at least they didn&rsquo;t fuck with the Middle East as a whole and/or North Korea and/or China (yet). I&rsquo;m not kidding, that makes me somewhat happy.
Yes, that is sad, but not on a personal level, I think.</p>
<p><em>16. What song will always remind you of 2004?</em> Probably &ldquo;Vertigo&rdquo; by U2.</p>
<p><em>17. Compared to this time last year, are you:</em> i. happier or sadder? Personal life: happier. Work life: much sadder. ii. thinner or fatter? No change. iii.
richer or poorer? A bit richer both in experience and financially, I think. ;)</p>
<p><em>18. What do you wish you&rsquo;d done more of?</em> Quitting my job, telling them to shove it. I wish I could do this once a week… the fun would never stop. Of course this&rsquo;d mean we&rsquo;d be broke in no time, so that makes it a no-go. (Short explanation: Dana needs to get a new job before I&rsquo;ll be willing to even consider any next steps.)</p>
<p><em>19. What do you wish you&rsquo;d done less of?</em> Getting that much agitated in the office. It&rsquo;s just not healty.</p>
<p><em>20. How did you spend Christmas?</em> With my wife. Good times, good times. :)</p>
<p><em>22. Did you fall in love in 2004?</em> I am in love already. Deeply, I might add.
No need or processing power to stray.</p>
<p><em>23. How many one-night stands?</em> I have an enormous penis. &ndash; Oh wait, that wasn&rsquo;t the question… None.</p>
<p><em>24. What was your favorite TV program?</em> Firefly.</p>
<p><em>25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn&rsquo;t hate this time last year?</em> I don&rsquo;t hate much. There&rsquo;s a lot of new stuff I find highly annoying, tho, yes.</p>
<p><em>26. What was the best book you read?</em> The Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson. Powerful books.</p>
<p><em>27. What was your greatest musical discovery?</em> I can make sounds with my armpits.</p>
<p><em>28. What did you want and get?</em> Oh boy. A new couch, check. Enough money to finally buy new furniture in January, check. Halo 2, check. World of Warcraft,
checkcheckcheck. :) Seriously tho, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff I wanted that I got.
I am grateful.</p>
<p><em>29. What did you want and not get?</em> New job.</p>
<p><em>30. What was your favorite film of this year?</em> &ldquo;The Incredibles&rdquo;, I think.
&ldquo;Luther&rdquo; was great, too.</p>
<p><em>31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</em> Can&rsquo;t really remember. And I turned 30.</p>
<p><em>32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</em> You should be able to guess by now. ;)</p>
<p><em>33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2004?</em> Ah, this
&ldquo;fashion&rdquo; thing everyone is talking about. I&rsquo;ve heard it&rsquo;s the rage among the kids nowadays, no?</p>
<p><em>34. What kept you sane?</em> The mood in our home, my marriage, and a few friends.</p>
<p><em>35. Which celebrity/public figure did you admire the most?</em> I can&rsquo;t think of a single public figure I particularly admire.</p>
<p><em>36. What political issue stirred you the most?</em> The insanity of the US election and its outcome. I&rsquo;m unable to understand it. At all. How…? Why…?
Didn&rsquo;t they…? Well, fear-mongering + deception + democracy == one big &ldquo;WTF?&rdquo;.
I mean, seriously, what the fuck. The World as such is a closed system, and one of the components seem to be completely fucking out of its mind… It&rsquo;s a good reason to be worried, methings. &ndash; Hey, you asked.</p>
<p><em>37. Who did you miss?</em> A couple of friends which are living far away.</p>

			 <p>So, we went to IKEA today, to buy a simple picture frame. When we left, we had bought this:</p>
<p><img src="//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2004-11-08-ektorp.jpg" alt="Couch"></p>
<p>In all fairness &ndash; we were eyeing it for about a year by now… and until one month ago, it cost €789. Then they lowered the price to €599. When we went there today the price tag said €299. We never had a chance, they got us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 2.15m long (that&rsquo;s ~613 feet or something, metric is so much better),
real leather, and damn comfy. They deliver it on Thursday, and with any luck,
I&rsquo;ll be getting Halo 2 the same day, so that&rsquo;ll probably the best day in my life, right after my wedding day. And the day I had good sex for the first time. And the day I… oh, you probably don&rsquo;t wanna know anyways.</p>
<p>I tell you, IKEA is the epitome of Dark Force. I loathe it for their skillful marketing abilities, and I totally envy it for the same thing. Unbelievable.
There wasn&rsquo;t ONE single IKEA visit yet where we didn&rsquo;t leave with much more crap than we had planned to buy. This place is customer Dantooine.</p>
<p>Anyways, looking forward to Thursday.</p>

			 <p>By now I&rsquo;m thoroughly depressed when I think about our <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/2004/07/22/of-love-hate-and-management-blogs/">aforementioned management blogs</a>. Today I had to learn a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>There were no new comments on the blog entry.</li>
<li>There was no new blog entry, not even a small one mentioning the staff meeting where the blog was explained.</li>
<li>The staff meeting where the blog was explained was a real h00t since the two managers (our vice and one of his quality management managers) were opposing themselves to a great deal. When the staff was discussing the why and how of the blog, the vice picked up his phone, listened to his mailbox, told everyone he had to go now and left.</li>
<li>I was told that one of the assistents is compiling a weekly digest of the blog comments made because they don&rsquo;t have the time to read them. She&rsquo;s supposed to extract the &ldquo;most valuable comments/opinions&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am aware that our vice CEO is incredibly busy and his job with the whole quality management isn&rsquo;t the easiest and most rewarding task. Subconciously, tho, I think we&rsquo;re fucked already.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to keep my mouth shut for the next two weeks and watch the whole thing from a quiet corner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep you posted.</p>

			 <p>My baby sister Claudia married her longtime friend Tino this weekend. Yes, we were invited. :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll skip the part where we fought against the Gods of the Autobahn on Friday (car crashes, construction sites and car crashes within construction sites along the road, took us ten hours to drive there) and how we got almost no sleep the night before and get right to the wedding day.</p>
<p>We drove to the town where the church is, Rossla. First, there was the appointment at the register office (that&rsquo;s the term?) where they were legally married. Afterwards we went over to the church where there was a nice ceremony (Tino&rsquo;s is of Christian faith). I was amazed to see they had hired a singer who was standing on the second floor, singing two songs (<em>My heart will go on</em> and <em>Goodbye, english rose</em>). Nice songs, she had a great, powerful voice, but I was slightly irrated by the fact that both songs are actually songs of farewell… nevermind. The priest was doing a great job talking about marriage and the life afterwards, and it was very cool and amusing, mostly because he wasn&rsquo;t preachy or anything, it was very down-to-earth and sometimes downright funny. (I thanked him afterwards… I was expecting some Father-Lovejoy&rsquo;ish speech, but I&rsquo;m glad he did it the way he did.)</p>
<p>Then we went for the traditional wedding day lunch (I really don&rsquo;t know what the english term is). The location was …interesting, to say the least. Apparently the owners were friends of Tino and Claudia. It was more a pub than a restaurant, and they clearly weren&rsquo;t outfitted to deal with 50 people. I mean, damn, they had four different types of spoons, knives and forks, and they had them <em>mixed</em>. That left me somewhat puzzled. The food was okay&rsquo;ish, but I was expecting something better on my sister&rsquo;s wedding day. Still, the newlyweds were enjoying it, so it was okay with me as well. (More on this notion later on.)</p>
<p>Afterwards, we drove to the final location, which was a restaurant slash rural party location, where they served coffee and cake and everything. That was nice. <strong>Great</strong> cake. A couple of hours later the catering service blessed us with good food again. :)</p>
<p>Finally the guy with the music arrived. He was some sort of village DJ, and I honestly have to say I loathed his mixture of music. I really did, it was tragically bad. In my personal opinion it was the musical version of a horrible and messy train crash. It was a mix of what Japanese and American tourist expect a typical German to listen to all day plus some eurodiscotrash from the slopes of the Alps (drunk skiing, yeah) plus the worst from the coasts of Mallorca. Interestingly, most people seemed to enjoy it. ;)</p>
<p>Then there was dancing, drinking, games for the newlyweds, drinking, yelling to the music, drinking, drinking, smoking, drinking and dancing.</p>
<p>All in all the night was rather strange to my eyes and ears. Yet, it seemed to thoroughly please both my sis and her husband, so it was okay with me as well. :)</p>
<p>At three in the morning, the party was over since everyone was either asleep, almost asleep, gone or hardly able to defy gravity due to excessive amounts of alcohol flooding their bloodstreams. (Man, these people can drink. I bet if more people would be like this, drinking was olympic already.)</p>
<p>A few thoughts about this very day and what I heard, saw and sensed. My sister is deeply in love with Tino, even after spending six years with him already, and this very day she was the happiest person in the world. I kinda know what it&rsquo;s like, and I&rsquo;m so glad she found a person to share her live with, not just some guy, but the very person who was clearly the missing piece in her life. I&rsquo;m thankful that I was able to catch a few glimpses of that love when they smiled at or danced with eachother.</p>
<p>But I think she hasn&rsquo;t married a single man, she&rsquo;s married a tribe, and I&rsquo;m <strong>not</strong> saying that in degrading manner. It&rsquo;s a small village, and apparently these few dozens of people all went through a couple of things over the last few decades, they know eachother and their lifes. It has brought them together in a family kind of sense. Many of them are related, closely or loosely, and those who are not are real friends. These people are there for eachother, they share everything, and if one of them ever needs help, the others are there.</p>
<p>My sister is part of this tribe now, and she&rsquo;s enjoying it. It is not my way of life, and while I don&rsquo;t think I could ever be a part of a community like this, I can clearly see that she can, and she is now. She&rsquo;s happy there, and so is her husband.</p>
<p>Over the last few years we were talking on the phone every now and then, and when she told me about the job insecurity and the fucked up job market I recommended packing the bags and moving away. She always told me that she wouldn&rsquo;t do that because of her friends and everything she had there. I wasn&rsquo;t really sure I understood what she meant, but there always was a certain sense of <em>&ldquo;my place is here&rdquo;</em>. I never really knew what she really wanted to express there, but now I know. And to be honest, I&rsquo;m glad I do.</p>
<p>So, all in all, I can say that the wedding day wasn&rsquo;t what I expected. Some parts were just great, other… eeeeh, not so much. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter what I think or what I would&rsquo;ve done if I had my say. I told her that (in my/our opinion) wedding days are best planned with the following thought in mind: <em>&ldquo;Screw you, it&rsquo;s OUR day.&quot;</em> Hell, we did the same. I&rsquo;m convinced half of the people at our wedding thought it was a crappy day, but who gives a damn, because it was our day, and it was good. So who cares whether I liked the lunch or the music &ndash; they seemed to enjoy it, my sister and her husband were happy, and that is <em>exactly</em> what counts for me. Also I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether my sister wasn&rsquo;t making a mistake by moving to a village as three times as big as our parking lot, but now I know she is happy there, this is what she wants. This is what she conciously decided her life should be like, and I&rsquo;m deeply and honestly happy for her. Not many people know for sure what they want, and they live their lifes constantly looking for a better place to live or better people to be with. She doesn&rsquo;t. Neither do I, and so I can relate, and seeing my little baby sister going her own way makes me really proud. :)</p>
<p>I love you, Claudia. Even if we don&rsquo;t talk much and almost never see eachother, I&rsquo;m with you. You&rsquo;ve picked a great guy to spend your life with, and I wish both of you the very best. May you have a good life and bright kids. You&rsquo;ll do great, you two. :)</p>
<p>Carlo</p>

			 <p><strong>Caution, rather unstructured rant ahead</strong></p>
<p>So, our internal company strategy is now mainly focussed on quality management, which, sadly is a topic long overdue. Not enough people, not enough time, to many fucking jobs in a day, the usual. Plus, an in-house communication which seems to come straight from the deepest depths in Hell.
One of the more capable managers was promoted vice CEO earlier this year, and our CEO tagged him with the honorable job of straightening out the internal processes &ndash; communications, inter-department processes, everything.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago we had a rather lengthy staff meeting about it where they were presenting the new ideas and everything. The new guy is actually a nice guy,
works for our company for a couple of years by now and knows his trades. Good for him. They&rsquo;ve announced that they want to flatten the hierarchies, to strengthen the overall quality of our work etc. etc. No layoffs, tho, in the long run we will probably hire a number of new people. And they want to do it
<strong>with</strong> us, not against us and not from above. Because they want it to take off, and they can&rsquo;t do that without the staff. So the premise is: whatever we do, we&rsquo;re trying to discuss it with you. And this time,we actually mean it.
(Actually, the whole quality management idea is one or two years late. People are tired, but hey, it&rsquo;s a just fight anyways.)</p>
<p>Well, good then. I applauded the overall notion.</p>
<p>(By now, they even hired an consultant who was interviewing people and assembling his findings in a report for everyone. <em>&ldquo;This is the mood, these are the problems, here are possible solutions, YMMV.&quot;</em> Was a good report, by the way.)</p>
<p>Pondering about how it can be done, I came to two conclusions. 1 - You can&rsquo;t email everyone everytime you want an opinion. 2 - You can&rsquo;t schedule a meeting everytime you want an opinion. So I went ahead and told them about management blogs. In great detail, actually. &ldquo;See, this is a weblog, this is the idea behind it, you&rsquo;d post and give those who want to discuss it the ability to do it&rdquo;. The vice CEO was amazed and thanked me for the idea, and to be honest, I still think he meant it. He asked me to set up a blog for him and his team
(the heads of our departments) so they can post whenever they feel like, i.e.
they want/need to live that new communication thang. (In the past, decisions were made and noone was informed, which led to confusion, anger and overall pissyness. You know the score, I guess.) He knew that if he wants to break the
&ldquo;nothing good has ever come from the top&rdquo; mood at the watercooler, he&rsquo;d have to fight for it.</p>
<p>So I did just that. After I&rsquo;ve explained the interface to them I told them four things.</p>
<ol>
<li>You have to post <strong>yourselves</strong>. It won&rsquo;t work if you let your secretaries do it. If you want it to work, <strong>you</strong> have to do it. If you don&rsquo;t plan to do that, we can stop right now.</li>
<li>You have to post regularily. Doesn&rsquo;t have to be long posts, just let them know whenever there is something going on, important or not. If you don&rsquo;t plan to do that, we can stop right now.</li>
<li>You have to explain people what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish. Only if they understand it, they won&rsquo;t oppose and/or ignore it.</li>
<li>Try to be clear and to the point.</li>
</ol>
<p>Number 3 is the hardest thing. We had about a dozen applications that were rolled out in the past, and noone told the staff why. <em>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bugtracking system.&rdquo; - &ldquo;What for? … Hello?&quot;</em> Couple of months later: <em>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a time tracking system.&rdquo; - &ldquo;Why are we doing this? … Hello?&quot;</em> It&rsquo;s pretty bad,
really. They count on us to figure it out ourselves. I&rsquo;m really not sure why they won&rsquo;t talk about it, but apparently in their minds the delivery is the goal. <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s delivered? Job&rsquo;s done.&quot;</em> Yeah. Except not. It&rsquo;s really really bad.</p>
<p>So, the new quality management idea is to communicate to avoid and solve problems. Great idea. The vice decided the new management blog is the way to go, the best tool for the job. Yes! Everything&rsquo;s gonna be peachy now!</p>
<p>Yeah. Except not.</p>
<p>Yesterday the vice CEO mailed the consultant&rsquo;s report to everyone. He mentioned the blog and that it&rsquo;ll be rolled out next week. My boys and I talked about it and concluded that spreading the report meant a raised need to discuss things, because that&rsquo;s what they said, the report is topic to discussion. It also meant that this day was the best day to officially start the management blog. You already have your first topic, so roll with it to promote the new tool you have. There&rsquo;d actually be a reason to check the blog
&ndash; you could discuss the different topics right there. So I&rsquo;ve told the Vice just that, and he agreed. This morning, one of his staff made the first post.
<em>&ldquo;Hello, this is a discussion board, here&rsquo;s the report, discuss please.&quot;</em> Then he mailed the URL to everyone, and that was it. When he wrote it he came to me asking which categories he should pick for the post. He was frightened and insecure about it. Well, you have to crawl before you learn to walk, right?
This was a new shore for him, the whole concept was/is rather alien to him and his pals. I figured they will become more secure as they use it.</p>
<p>When I talked about it with my co-workers at lunch, I was greeted by shrugs.
<em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo; - &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand that, what is it, a new tool we&rsquo;re supposed to use?&rdquo; - &ldquo;Do I have to post there now? ME?&quot;</em> Apparently they had no idea what to do with it. The concept was alien to them as well. And it made sense they were confused &ndash; because noone explained the idea to them in the first place.</p>
<p>And that was the point where I felt like banging my head against something very, very hard.</p>
<p>A couple of problems here.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They read the report by the consultant, apparently they talked about it in one or two meetings, but the line <em>&ldquo;You, the management, aren&rsquo;t vocal enough about your actions and you should fucking change that if you want your employees to fucking trust you again (fuck)&quot;</em> didn&rsquo;t go through. (I&rsquo;ve paraphrased a bit.) The post and the mail by our head of department was clearly too cryptic and vague again. Old style. No change there. (I didn&rsquo;t notice right away because I knew what the idea behind the blog is.) Violation of rule #4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Vice didn&rsquo;t hand the job to his secretary but one of his staffers. At least for the introductory post I&rsquo;d have wished for a post by him. It&rsquo;s about examples, about setting a certain standard, by giving your employees a feeling of <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying hard not to repeat the mistakes of the past, this time we really want to do it&rdquo;</em>. Alas, he was to busy to spend 15 minutes posting the first entry. Disappointing. Violation of rule #1… in a way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One post, one mail, everyone but a handful of people was confused. Great job. Violation of rule #3. Excellent work, Smithers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Summary: It&rsquo;s not about the tool, it&rsquo;s about how you communicate, it&rsquo;s about content. It&rsquo;s a long way ahead, I think, but at this very moment I feel we&rsquo;re doomed once again. Why? Because the management still have no real clue. If they had, if they would&rsquo;ve understood the (probably hysterically expensive)
findings report, they would&rsquo;ve tried to change something right away. They would&rsquo;ve tried to be clear and trustworthy and convincingly trying. <em>sigh</em> We might have upgraded our tools to be tools of the 21st century, but in the end it probably just means we&rsquo;ll poke our eye out with a state-of-the-art laser-
guided pickaxe.</p>
<p>So, what next? They&rsquo;ve scheduled a staff meeting for tomorrow where they tell everyone what they want to accomplish. (I won&rsquo;t be around to attend because my baby sister is getting married and we&rsquo;re on our merry way to their place.) I really hope they won&rsquo;t fuck that up as well.</p>
<p>And I really hope that when I come back on Monday, there&rsquo;ll be one or two more posts in the blog and a couple of comments to go along with.</p>

			 <p>Writing software is getting harder and harder. The more you learn, the harder it gets. It&rsquo;s not about the code (as <a href="http://allinthehead.com/retro/203/">Drew noticed earlier</a> &ndash; his article got me thinking quite a bit, actually), it&rsquo;s about the mind, the architecture,
the wish to do things well right from the start.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m there. While I was hammering down rather silly but working PHP code for G-Blog.net as it stands today, I&rsquo;m advancing much more careful in my development of the new version. Serenity (the codename for G-Blog.net v2) is one big construction site, and even tho everything is progressing rather nicely, I always have the feeling to forget something, a particular thought,
that - once I&rsquo;ve overlooked it - could bring the whole thing down later on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably nonsense, but still, the nagging feeling is there.</p>
<p>Other than that, I&rsquo;m slowly getting there. Python is a charm to work with, and my tools of the trade are <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/">Komodo</a>, <a href="http://www.sqlobject.org/">SQLObject</a>, <a href="http://www.effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm">ElementTree</a> and
<a href="http://dealmeida.net/projects/textile/">PyTextile</a>. I&rsquo;ve written a SettingParser module to not have to write every settings page by hand (does the rendering of the pages, the validation of the single settings and input fields, as well as the user level authentification,
all controlled by a description XML file), I&rsquo;ve tightened security/privacy on an user model level (i.e. there&rsquo;s even less chance anyone but you will see your private entries), you can already make and edit entries, the registration/login etc. are built in, user levels (as in free accounts,
premium accounts, moderators, admins etc.)… there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff done in its basic form, and I think I got a good foundation to further develop the site.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, I&rsquo;m slowly getting there. (Emphasis on &ldquo;slowly&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>Anyways, I felt like utilizing my screen capture utility today, so here are
<a href="http://docs.g-blog.net/bilder_etc/serenity/">some early shots of Serenity</a>.</p>
<p>Back to work.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="20-stages-of-perl-to-python-conversion">20 Stages of Perl to Python Conversion</h3>
<ol>
<li>See a reference to Python being compared favorably to Perl. Think to
yourself, &ldquo;another stupid little language that thinks it&rsquo;s better than Perl.&rdquo;
Ignore it. Repeat many times.</li>
<li>After seeing some reference to Python, decide, &ldquo;what the hell, I&rsquo;ll
have a look.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Take a look at the language. Start with the tutorial. Become utterly
aghast at the use of indentation for nesting. Think, &ldquo;Where are the braces?
Where are the begin and end statements?&rdquo; Recall the horrors of Fortran 77.
Spaghetti code. Fixed column format. Think about running away screaming.</li>
<li>Decide instead to push on in disbelief. Encounter the part of the
tutorial about modules. Become utterly aghast that Python does not place high
importance on data hiding. Think, &ldquo;Python not supporting data hiding goes
against every fundamental principle of object oriented programming I know
(especially since I&rsquo;ve also been led to believe C++ is the beginning and end
of OOP).&rdquo;</li>
<li>Run away screaming.</li>
<li>Time passes.</li>
<li>Realize that you&rsquo;d overreacted. Think, &ldquo;Python probably does have it&rsquo;s
place. It&rsquo;s still no Perl.&rdquo;</li>
<li>See another reference to Python, this time even more favorable than
before. Decide to give it another try, and maybe this time write some code
instead of just follow the tutorial.</li>
<li>Pick some little project, some little easy thing, you&rsquo;ve been meaning
to do. Get to work on it in Python.</li>
<li>About halfway through the project, come to the sudden and ironic
realization that the use indentation for nesting, which you had thought would
you would never get used to, has become natural.</li>
<li>Finish the project with only the typical minor difficulties involved
in learning a new language, but without any major hair pulling.</li>
<li>Acknowledge to yourself that Python is quite nice. Admit that there
are some things about it better than Perl. Acknowledge that it is certainly
better looking. Decide to use it again. Think, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still no Perl.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Use Python again the next day for a slightly larger proejct. Only
yesterday, you would have chosen Perl for this project without another
thought. Even after finishing the previous day&rsquo;s little project in Python, you
had briefly considered using Python for this larger one, but decided to use
Perl because it was too large to attempt with a language you were unfamiliar
with. Today, however, you decide to use Python anyways. Python seems strangely
alluring to you. Rationalize this by telling yourself that a larger project
such as this is a good way to learn Python faster. Think, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still no
Perl.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Time passes. Life happens. Choose Python for several little projects
that come along, all for the purpose of learning it better. Think, &ldquo;Python is
still no Perl.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Encounter a project much larger than anything you&rsquo;ve used Python for
yet. Decide, &ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ve been using and liking Python for all these little
projects I&rsquo;ve been doing. Now that I have a much harder and larger project, it
is time to use the proven workhorse, Perl, a language I am very familiar with
and one that is ideally suited for this project.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Begin the project in Perl.</li>
<li>After writing about ten lines, begin pulling out your hair. Become
disgusted at the ugly travesty your fingers just produced. Recall the horrors
of Perl. Poor indentation. Ambiguous semantics. Line noise. That section in
the Perl man page where it gives several examples of &ldquo;good ways&rdquo; to implement
a switch statement, while discouraging the most straightforward way. Think, &ldquo;I
cannot believe I&rsquo;ve been swallowing this garbage for years. What a masochist I
was. I was being screwed over by this pitiful hack of a language for all that
time, and I loved it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Run away screaming.</li>
<li>Finish the project in Python.</li>
<li>Refect upon your experience. Realize the dissidence of your former
admiration of Perl. Remember the occasions where you would have questioned
some of the now obvious design flaws in Perl, but didn&rsquo;t, because Perl was
everything cool, and everyone was using it. Think, &ldquo;Python is still no Perl.
Thank God.&rdquo;</li>
<li>(Optional) Log on to your favorite chat room, and never miss an
opportunity to plug your new favorite language. Because your typical style is
to use understatement, your firm and absolute devotion to Python will be
perceived as a very strong message, that will make people think.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I wish our resident Perl zealots wouldn&rsquo;t be just that: Zealots. A more open mind would help us all.</p>
<p>PS: Python is full of love and mind-numbing beauty.</p>

			 <p>After building community sites for a while by now I think I have grasped the social dynamics blueprint of community sites to some degree. For example: most community-centered sites are starting out small (naturally), then gathering a relatively small loyal following (#1), then gaining momentum (#2), attracting more and more regulars (#3) and &ndash; after a while &ndash; die (#4). The circle of life, so to speak. But the devil&rsquo;s in the details. Let&rsquo;s take a look at how it works (according to me):</p>
<ol>
<li>The small loyal following. People find the site through different channels; they like the concept, the idea, identify with it and decide to stick to it. Everyone knows everyone else, fuzzy feelings ensue, good place to hang out.</li>
<li>Gaining momentum. The regulars tell their friends who come to check it out, are heartily welcomed by the existing users who like to see their beloved site to bloom. They believe in the site for a number of reason, that&rsquo;s why they hang out there all the time. There&rsquo;s a feeling of going forward, of reaching out to the sky.</li>
<li>Attracting more and more regulars. Too many people to know everyone, the old sense of community is somewhat lost in the site&rsquo;s process of growing. With the flood of new people joining there are a couple of black sheep (read: trolls and fuckwads) who get an utterly moronic kick out of annoying people for one reason or the other.</li>
<li>Death of the site. The oldtimers have lost the faith in the site after seeing it go down the drain, after literally feeling the sense of quality, both in people and content. It&rsquo;s just not the same anymore. A few hardcore believers try to stay and smooth the waves but the majority doesn&rsquo;t care anymore, and their voices don&rsquo;t have the same weight anymore. Too many people, it&rsquo;s like the paradise is lost in a sea of tourists. The oldtimers leave, with them goes the old spirit of the site, the very soul of it, the maintainers get desillusioned, start to drink and close the site, having lost their faith in mankind.</li>
</ol>
<p>Personally I think this life cycle is bound to happen to every community site on this planet. Sooner or later, doesn&rsquo;t matter, the Community Reaper is going to get them/us all. My belief.</p>

<p>So, our little scooter is broken, the lights burn out every 10 klicks. It&rsquo;s less than a year old, so this problem should be a warranty case. I bring the scooter to the damn shop, and they refuse to answer my hypothetical &ldquo;warranty yes/no&rdquo; question. Fine, okay, they don&rsquo;t want to answer that question as long as they don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong. I can relate.</p>
<p>That was two days ago.</p>
<p>Yesterday I call them, asking whether they&rsquo;re done or not - I need the scooter back.</p>
<p>them: &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t done yet, we had to order a part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>me: &ldquo;Ah, I see. So I&rsquo;ll be able to pick it up tomorrow then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>them: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>me: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll call me when you know whether I can pick it up tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>them: &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ll call you when it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>me: &ldquo;Umm, I&rsquo;d rather know whether you can make it tomorrow or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>them: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call you when it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>me: &ldquo;But I need to know, I have to plan my day.&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s true, since it&rsquo;s a pain in the ass to get there.)</p>
<p>them: &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>me: &ldquo;…&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that point I was rather pissed. So, I&rsquo;ve just called them again.</p>
<p>me: &ldquo;Hi, I wanted to ask about my Scooter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>them: &ldquo;What was it again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>me: <em>names scooter type and the problem</em></p>
<p>them: &ldquo;Ah. Yes, the part wasn&rsquo;t shipped here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>me: &ldquo;So, I can&rsquo;t pick it up today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>them: &ldquo;If I get it in time, you can pick it up later today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>me: &ldquo;Great, can you call me when you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>them: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you when it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>me: &ldquo;I have to know up front so I know what bus to take. I&rsquo;m not going to drive out there just to learn it ain&rsquo;t done yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>them: &ldquo;Hmmm… well, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>me: &ldquo;Tell you what, I&rsquo;ll call again in two hours to see whether you got the part or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>them: &ldquo;Hmm. Well, yeah, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the last time I had a machine there, I swear. The stupid thing is that the only reason I brought the scooter there was because we bought it there
(back then they were much friendlier and supportive) and I thought the warranty thing would be easier there.</p>
<p>Goddammit.</p>

			 <p>Okay, so you want to use SpamBayes on your mail server in order to enjoy working with your webmail or IMAP again. Here&rsquo;s how to do it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your DH mail account needs to have shell access.</li>
<li>Install the latest <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> in your <code>$HOME</code> directory.</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/unix.html">SpamBayes</a> (I recommend the CVS version as the official/stable builds wouldn&rsquo;t install for me) as described in the paragraph &ldquo;Procmail&rdquo; on the linked page.</li>
<li>Using your webmail interface or IMAP, set up the following new folders: <code>Spam</code>, <code>TrainingHam</code>, <code>TrainingSpam</code>, <code>Unsure</code>.</li>
<li>Write the following code to a file named <code>.procmailrc</code>:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># ~/.procmailrc for Dreamhost
# Uses Maildir format mail directory.

## Directory for storing procmail-related files PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail

## Set to yes when debugging

## Remove # when debugging; set to no if you want minimal logging
# LOGABSTRACT=all

# Message directory (Courier IMAP and mutt)
MAILDIR=$HOME/Maildir

:0 fwr:hamlock
| $HOME/bin/sb_filter.py


# Messages that are so obviously spam that we should not train on them
# are put in the Spam folder.

# the recipient folder to /dev/null in order to delete the spam that
# scored 1.0 right away.)

$HOME/Maildir/.TrainingHam -s $HOME/Maildir/.TrainingSpam &gt;&gt;
$HOME/cronjob_sb_mboxtrain.log`
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Do a <code>crontab .cronjob</code> to install the cronjobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s it: You&rsquo;re basically done!</p>
<p>What does this setup do?</p>
<ol>
<li>Every incoming mail is scanned by SpamBayes.</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s definitely spam, it&rsquo;s moved out of your inbox to the <code>Spam</code> folder.</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s most likely spam, it&rsquo;ll remain in your inbox, and a copy is placed in the <code>TrainingSpam</code> folder for learning purposes.</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s most likely ham (good mail), it&rsquo;ll remain in your inbox, and a copy is placed in the <code>TrainingHam</code> folder for learning purposes.</li>
<li>If SpamBayes can&rsquo;t tell what it is, a copy is placed in the <code>Unsure</code> folder.</li>
<li>Good mail is kept in the inbox.</li>
<li>Once per night the cronjob (scheduled automatic task) is training your SpamBayes database with the contents of the <code>TrainingHam</code> and <code>TrainingSpam</code> folders.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first couple of days or weeks you might have to do some manual sorting in order to train SpamBayes to tell good from bad; if you have spam in your inbox, you move it to the folder <code>TrainingSpam</code>. If your <code>Spam</code> folder or
<code>TrainingSpam</code> contain good mails (ham), move those to <code>TrainingHam</code>. If there is mail in the &ldquo;Unsure&rdquo; folder, SpamBayes isn&rsquo;t sure whether it&rsquo;s spam or ham,
so you have to sort the mails to one of the two training folders yourself.</p>
<p>The initial training can be a bit tiresome, but after a relatively short period of time you&rsquo;ll enjoy a spam free inbox again. By now it works so well for me and Dana that we don&rsquo;t run spam filters in our desktop mail clients anymore. We just don&rsquo;t need them anymore. :)</p>
<p>A little shortcut for the initial training: connect to your mailbox via IMAP and copy all the old spam mails from your desktop clients to the
<code>TrainingSpam</code> folder on the server. I did that with a couple of hundreds spam mails, and that sped up my initial training quite remarkably. ;) Also, once your account is trained, and you want to repeat your success on another mail account, you can copy the file <code>.hammiedb</code> (which is all the training data) to the new account once you have set up everything there. :)</p>
<p>Have fun, and good luck.</p>

			 <p>Little follow-up to my <a href="http://g-blog.net/entry/14947">last work post</a> &ndash; now I am comfortable with giving away details.</p>
<p>So, we got the new boss, restructuring the tech/server/CMS department and our web/production department. So far, so good. Luckily, &ldquo;restructuring&rdquo; (in this case) doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;lay-offs&rdquo;; instead, a few new people are coming aboard.
The departments are getting reordered big time, they are actually trying to introduce a higher degree of structure, people are shuffled around and so on.</p>
<p>In the end, we don&rsquo;t have the two aforementioned departments but two new ones named &ldquo;IT Services&rdquo; and &ldquo;Multimedia Service&rdquo; (yes, it had to be english again,
even tho it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make sense, but hey) sporting two or three subdivisions each. Part of IT Services is one completely new &ldquo;Application Development&rdquo; division… and I&rsquo;m the leader holding the very fate of four doomed men in my hands, with Morn being one of my new beehatches taking care of a team of five guys.</p>
<p>Well, &ldquo;tadaaaa&rdquo; and stuff. :)</p>
<p>Apparently my vicious fight for the long overdue introduction of a versioning system, long overdue documentation requirements, long overdue workflow change as well as my stunningly good looks and witty remarks finally paid off. Well,
maybe it was just the versioning and workflow stuff. Anyways, so next week we&rsquo;re moving desks to our new offices (same floor, no really big deal). Of course there&rsquo;ll be a four-to-eight weeks period of handing over jobs,
knowledge and responsibilities to others, but after that, the daily business on a customer basis should be gone, and we should be working on a broader scale, consolidating our weak and shattered efforts to write good applications. I think our new team is a capable bunch, and I&rsquo;m looking forward working with them. Well, I don&rsquo;t want to bother you with the gory details;
probably doesn&rsquo;t make much sense if you&rsquo;re not part of the company.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure yet what kind of team leader I&rsquo;m going to be. I&rsquo;m still undecided. The despotic, ruthless leader with the iron fist? The evil mastermind with the cat? Nah, I think working on a rather democratic basis is the best idea. Learning from the all bad examples around me how not to do it is a good idea, methinks. ;)</p>
<p>On the downside: I&rsquo;m not sharing an office with my dear fem co-worker S.
anymore, which always meant hijinks. Also, the company is pulling the &ldquo;Great Company Card of Motivation&rdquo; on me, which translates into &ldquo;probably more work,
more responsibility, same pay&rdquo;. The usual. When will they ever learn? Also, my old department is going to be crushed under the workload since they&rsquo;ve transferred pretty much 50% of us to the other department. Smart move.</p>
<p>Still, I have new responsibilities, a new field of work and I think we&rsquo;re on the brink of revolution regarding the way we do our work. We&rsquo;re about to propel the development facet of this company into the 21st century… or at least the late 20th century. :P</p>
<p>Gives me some of my long-lost energy back. We&rsquo;ll see how long it can last.</p>

			 <p>I hereby proclaim the new official term to describe the casting show /
petridish cloning boy/girl band &ldquo;music&rdquo;:</p>
<p><strong>ProstiPop</strong>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prosti&rdquo; as in &ldquo;prostitutes&rdquo;, &ldquo;pop&rdquo; as in &ldquo;pop music&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not that far fetched if you think about it. They want fame and money <em>now</em>, without much work (face it, kids… one or two months in a &ldquo;talent camp&rdquo; is <em>nothing</em> compared to a life full of devotion and hard work), they are willing to sell their soul as well as their bodies/looks (as in &ldquo;they&rsquo;re just puppets, Jim&rdquo;)
for media coverage, and they are fine with the idea to not have old friends as band members but complete strangers.</p>
<p>Thus, I think they qualify as prostitutes.</p>
<p>They <em>might</em> not do the producers, but if you are willing to sign 20-year contracts (!) just to become yet another no-talent ass-clown on national TV then you&rsquo;re either desperate or an idiot or both.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>PS: I also proclaim the term &ldquo;YANTASCONT&rdquo; (&ldquo;yet another no-talent ass-clown on national TV&rdquo;) to be a valid new media buzzword. PPS: Spread the word, stop the ProstiPoppers.</p>

			 <p>Big restructuring is going on in the office. For the first time in two-
and-a-half years I have the feeling we&rsquo;re moving. I&rsquo;m not fully sure yet it&rsquo;s forward we&rsquo;re going to - at least not in the short run; in the long term, we probably are, yes. (There are still a couple of people we need to get rid of before we can get up to full speed, I think.)</p>
<p>So, yesterday was the weirdest day so far. Apparently I&rsquo;ve accidently impressed my boss to some degree with my research/debating/apps/work I&rsquo;ve done since he started a couple of weeks ago, because now that the new structure was introduced, I was offered a key position. Talk about falling up the ladder,
even if it&rsquo;s just one or two steps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really comfortable going into more details yet, tho.</p>
<p>Interesting times ahead, it seems. I refuse getting all too excited; I am working in this company too long to know that hopes are way too easy to crush.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep you posted, assuming you care.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been toying around with Dean Allen&rsquo;s mui funky <a href="http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</a> for a while by now, and finally, as I&rsquo;m approaching a certain state of development in G-Blog.net v2, I think I have a use for it. It&rsquo;ll most likely be the formatting gizmo of choice for the next version of this very site.</p>
<p>Anyways, while the original <a href="http://www.textism.com/article/739/">version 2.0 beta</a> is great, it&rsquo;s somewhat annoying to have as part of an object-oriented framework, since this version is basically just a number of functions. The code is good, but the frame that&rsquo;s holding it isn&rsquo;t. So I&rsquo;ve took the liberty of refactoring (kind of) the code into a PHP class which can easily be used in an OO context. I didn&rsquo;t add to its original feature set, I&rsquo;ve merely restructured the whole thing a bit.</p>
<p>How to use it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: get XHTML from a given Textile-markup string ($givenstring)</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<pre><code>   $textile =&amp; new Textile();
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>   print $textile-&gt;TextileThis($givenstring);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>Example: get Textile-markup from a given XHTML string ($givenstring)</li>
<li>Please note: This method is still work in progress.</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<pre><code>   $textile =&amp; new Textile();
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>   print $textile-&gt;DeTextileThis($givenstring);
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, without further ado: <a href="http://docs.g-blog.net/code/Textile/2.0beta_class_version/class.textile.php.txt">On to the Textile 2.0 beta class version!</a></p>

<a href="http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/windows.html">SpamBayes Outlook Plugin</a> is keeping me sane in the office. (Well, at least when it comes to email.)</p>
<p>But is it enough? The good the filters are, I still am overwhelmed by spam when I open up my webmail interface &ndash; the mail in there is already filtered by SpamAssassin but not yet processed by my client filters.</p>
<p>Or am I? A couple of weeks ago I&rsquo;ve discovered <a href="http://www.0Spam.com">0Spam.com</a>, a relatively new kid on the block. 0Spam&rsquo;s concept is a tad bit different from the usual spam filters, since it&rsquo;s making use of whitelists and blacklists. Here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>Every ten minutes or so, the 0Spam gizmos check my POP3 account. If they find mails from senders which are not on my whitelist yet, they&rsquo;re are moved to the 0Spam server, and the sender is sent a validation mail. Now the sender
(assuming it&rsquo;s a real person and not a viagra-powered penis enlargement robot)
has a week to visit the link in the mail where s/he is presented with a validation code s/he has to enter manually. Once this is done, the 0Spam gizmos know the original mail came from an actual human, and the particular mail is moved from the 0Spam server back to my POP3 account. The sender is then marked as &ldquo;good&rdquo; for future reference, which means that once you&rsquo;ve visited that validation link after mailing me, you won&rsquo;t have to do it ever again. You&rsquo;re validated once, and that&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>There are a number of settings I can edit in my account. First of all, I can set the time span the sender is given to validation link - options range between 1 to 14 days. If the sender doesn&rsquo;t visit the validation page within that time frame, the mail will be discarded. Second, I can set up more than just one POP3/Hotmail/Yahoo account to be checked periodically by ospam.
Third, I can influence the auto-whitelisting behaviour (the above mentioned behaviour of automatically marking a validated sender as &ldquo;good&rdquo; for the future).</p>
<p>Entering whitelists and blacklists.</p>
<p>A so-called &ldquo;whitelist&rdquo; is a list of good senders, people or domains that are trusted. The email whitelist is a list of all email addresses that are allowed to send you mail, which is kept up to date automatically. However, you can import your address book into the email whitelist to make it easier for your contacts to verify their first email to you. The domain whitelist allows you to whitelist any message from one or more specified domains and the keyword whitelist lets any mail into your inbox that contains any word or phrase you provide. Just to make sure I don&rsquo;t miss any important mails by people or sites I know, I&rsquo;ve imported my address book, and fed a number of domain name fragments to the domain whitelist, for instance &ldquo;amazon&rdquo;, &ldquo;bloglines.com&rdquo;,
&ldquo;bungie&rdquo;, &ldquo;dreamhost.com&rdquo; and &ldquo;ebay&rdquo;. As you can see, you don&rsquo;t have to provide full domains; allowing &ldquo;amazon&rdquo; to mail me means mails from amazon.de,
amazon.com, amazon.ca etc. go thru. You get the picture.</p>
<p>Blacklists are the exact opposite, but they have to be treated more carefully.
You may configure 0Spam.com to block mail from your account if a message is from any address in the email blocklist or if it contains a word or phrase found in the keyword blocklist. It&rsquo;s not recommended to use the email blocklist to block spammers, as most spammers use email addresses that change each time they send out mail. Sometimes it <em>is</em> nice to have a blocklist, tho.
For instance, after receiving 20 &ldquo;security patches&rdquo; from &ldquo;Microsoft Support&rdquo; a day (I&rsquo;m talking about the Blaster worm which was sending itself across the net using supportATmicrosoftDOTcom as fake sender), I&rsquo;ve put the said mail address on the blocklist, and the mails were discarded as soon as 0Spam discovered them.</p>
<p>So far, the service works like a charm for me. The key to leading a care-free life with 0Spam without loosing all your friends is to import your address book and to think hard about what domains should be whitelisted. Remember -
even Amazon and Ebay are using bots to send out different types of valid mails, and these bots will not make it thru the validation. Therefore you should definitely whitelist these domains you know for certain you&rsquo;ll be receiving good mails from. I highly recommend skimming thru your mail client&rsquo;s trash folder to see which sites are &ldquo;rightfully&rdquo; mailing you periodically.</p>
<p>The great thing about 0Spam is that it works with almost every email account on the planet. And you don&rsquo;t even have to change anything in your mail client setup, because it&rsquo;s not really sitting between you and your mailbox, it&rsquo;s more like an automated watchdog doing its rounds roughly every ten minutes,
grabbing everything from your mailbox that doesn&rsquo;t seem to belong there.</p>
<p>By the way, if your mail client is always open and getting new mails from the server every minute or so, 0Spam will not work, because the mail client will most likely grab the mails before 0Spam can. Hence, the filtering will fail.
So it&rsquo;s recommended to make your mail client check for new messages every 30 minutes or once per hour. This might seem long, but remember, you&rsquo;re not getting that much &ldquo;good&rdquo; mails anyways &ndash; you&rsquo;re just not noticing it because of all the spam. ;)</p>
<p>Also, once 0Spam took a peek at a mail, it&rsquo;ll be marked as read. I&rsquo;m not sure whether or not this applies to Hotmail accounts as well, but it does for my plain old vanilla POP3 account. The mails are marked as unread in my mail client after downloading them from the server, tho, so I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a problem. It sure is not for me.</p>
<p>Alltogether I&rsquo;m very happy with 0Spam. It&rsquo;s doing a fine job. The service is running quite stable so far, even tho it&rsquo;s still in development. And even if a spam mail is making it thru the 0Spam filter because it&rsquo;s claiming to be from buyviagragoddammitATebayDOTcom - my Firebird will catch it client-side.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re still having problems with unsolicited emails, give <a href="http://www.0spam.com">0Spam</a> a whirl. The site is a bit plain, but the service is free and working. I can&rsquo;t tell you whether there are hidden drawbacks or not. Theoretically speaking,
there is a chance someone else&rsquo;s filter will mark the 0Spam validation mails as spam. I&rsquo;m not aware of such a case, but you&rsquo;ll never know. Also, some might argue that this type of service (whitelisters) are &ldquo;against&rdquo; the &ldquo;open character&rdquo; of email, i.e. the idea behind the medium - everyone can be reached by everyone else. I say the medium went downhill once email marketing took off. Personally, I&rsquo;m rather talking to others using Jabber/ICQ/AIM than email;
it&rsquo;s a more fluid conversation. YMMV.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s it. From the &ldquo;spam fuckers made our live worse&rdquo; front, this is ye olde Gossip.</p>

			 <p>My big &ldquo;semi-sister&rdquo; accepted an honest proposal made to her by her boyfriend.
In short, they&rsquo;ll get married. Congrats, my dear Susi. I&rsquo;m so glad you finally got your ass up, Andreas. ;) I already thought I&rsquo;d see her implode with excitement over this relationship before you were able to ask her, hehe.</p>
<p>This reminds me that my baby sister and her boyfriend decided to get married a while ago <em>as well</em>. I was totally sure I&rsquo;ve posted this here already, but apparently I didn&rsquo;t. Damn you, my weak mind! Anyways, my &ldquo;real&rdquo; sister is getting married, too. Which I suspected to happen for the last three or four years already… turns out I&rsquo;ve foreseen the future once again. ;) So, belated congratulations to you, too, Claudia! And Tino, of course!</p>
<p>Man, next year is gonna be wedding&rsquo;ish to the max. Funk!</p>

			 <p>A breakthru for mankind: I&rsquo;m writing this entry using my lap. Well, the iBook sitting on my lap, to be precise. I love this thing. (The iBook.) Great piece of hardware, definitely a keeper. Which, of course, is directly connected to the rather hefty price tag. Then again, it was a breeze to set up and connect to the Internet, too, and it&rsquo;s a rather pleasant experience alltogether after all so far.</p>
<p>How to connect an iBook to a (Windows) LAN:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plug in LAN cable.</li>
<li>Use the network properties to either use the &ldquo;automatic connection type guessing gizmo&rdquo; or simply enter the wanted IP address.</li>
<li>Done.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whaddaya know, that&rsquo;s it. No hassle, no reboots, just workie. I start to believe the Apple marketing department didn&rsquo;t lie after all. ;)</p>
<p>Oh, and speaking of gizmos… this baby is oozing style and gizmos and style gizmos. For example, when you close the iBook, it&rsquo;ll enter sleep mode. How do you see it&rsquo;s in sleep mode? There&rsquo;s a little soft light on it, and it&rsquo;s pulsating in the same frequency as a baby asleep. I love it. :)</p>

<p>It works in much the same way as its female counterpart, which uses the hormones estrogen and progestin to shut off the release of eggs to prevent pregnancy. In the male version, testosterone and progestin are used to turn off sperm production.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m writing PHP code on a regular basis, and I need to document my code.</p>
<p>Problem: I&rsquo;m lazy, and 9 out of 10 times, the basic <a href="http://www.phpdoc.de/">phpDoc</a> comments for functions or variables/properties are semantically identical.</p>
<p>Solution: <a href="http://docs.g-blog.net/code/cDocPHP/0.1/">cDocPHP</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little script I hacked together. It&rsquo;s neither neatly written nor particularly great nor commented (hehe), but what it does, it does quite okay.
So what does it do? Simple: it&rsquo;s a little form where you can input a package name, your name (i.e. the author&rsquo;s name) and upload a PHP file. When you submit, the script will process the uploaded file: it&rsquo;ll be scanned line by line, and as soon as it finds a variable declaration (&ldquo;var $xyz&rdquo;) or a class declaration (&ldquo;class xyz&rdquo;) or a function declaration (&ldquo;function xyz()&quot;), a pile of pre-written <a href="http://www.phpdoc.de/">phpDoc</a> comment tags is inserted. If a function is found,
it&rsquo;ll scan the contents of the function, and if there is a return value specified, a &ldquo;@return …&rdquo; tag is added to the comments as well. That&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a killer app, but it&rsquo;s a timesaver. Plus you don&rsquo;t have to remember whether there was a return value or not. If the script added a return comment,
then there was. Sure, you still have to fill in the nitty gritty, but in the end, you&rsquo;ll save time nonetheless.</p>
<p>I wrote it because I needed something like it, it was written in a 20 minutes timeframe, and it&rsquo;s cool for what it does. And so, with a honest tip to hat to
<a href="http://simon.incutio.com/">Simon</a>, I&rsquo;ll share my love with you. If you like it, use it, if not,
don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s as easy as this. ;) If you know a tool that does it better, please tell me &ndash; as I&rsquo;ve said, I need all the documentation/tagging help I can get…</p>

			 <p>Another Sobig worm is making its rounds. It doesn&rsquo;t make use of any hidden security holes, it solely utilizes the stupidity of people. I still can&rsquo;t understand why people are opening attachments from people they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So the worm is spreading like a fucking wildfire, scans the infected PC for email addresses, and sends out mails using the found addresses as either sender or recipient. Somewhere, it found some of my old company email addresses, and now I&rsquo;m getting tons of &ldquo;you suck, please fuck yourself and die noisily&rdquo; mails from virus walls and other companies' security countermeasures which think I sent those mails.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I went to a class reunion. We graduated 13 years ago and obviously a lot has happened. The evening was actually quite pleasant, and I had some good conversations. Hell, I even managed to make a demon from the past disappear&hellip; and that was a great thing.</p>
<p>Well, it was a good night, and now I&rsquo;m back home in Munich. Somehow, this evening with all the talking, all the memories of the past, this reminiscence as such, makes me feel even more at home here, away from the places of my school days. Not necessarily a bad thing. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ve seen what some of them have done with their lives so far, or even, what they haven&rsquo;t done. Many of us left this town, this part of Germany, and found a future somewhere else, but some of us stayed, and some of them looked like they&rsquo;d lost their faith somehow. It may sound harsh, but I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not one of them.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, it was a good place to live. I had a good home. As I grew up, I outgrew the place and one day I left.</p>
<p>Looking back now, all these years later, is strange. Old thoughts, buried in my subconscious for a long time, have resurfaced. My school days are back in my mind. I don&rsquo;t feel like talking about it much, and I even doubt that the memories will affect me in any way, but I guess the memories of events that are now past will be there for a few days.</p>

			 <p><strong>TL;DR: An afternoon suffering through the performance of an improv theatre troupe is likely not going to save the company after all.</strong></p>
<p>The whole staff had to participate in a mandatory &ldquo;workshop&rdquo; today. Until we&rsquo;ve arrived at the location on afternoon we had no clue what would happen;
being the sceptical bitches we are my co-workers and I declared that if this would turn out to be one of those &ldquo;get off your shoes and hold eachothers hands&rdquo; type of thing, we&rsquo;d leave the scene immediately. Oh boy, we had <em>no</em> idea.</p>
<p>When we got there, it all started out with the more or less usual standing around, waiting for doom to hit us. While we were waiting, three totally unfamiliar faces showed up; one woman was dressed like a cleaning lady and bitching at several co-workers, one guy tried and failed miserably to make a
&ldquo;austrian waiter&rdquo; impression, and the second woman was running around in a business dress telling people she had &ldquo;no clue what&rsquo;s going on here but someone mentioned hats&rdquo; (quote). At this point we all were highly suspicious and tried to get drunk quickly - which is somewhat hard when all you got is orange juice and lemonade.</p>
<p>Then the fun began. We had to play games. No, not FPS or RTS, but the bad type. The &ldquo;look out, the bogeyman is trying to get you&rdquo; stuff. And counting games with numbers and noises. I&rsquo;m serious. Silly shit. This crap went on for a while, then these fools came up with a play for the staff - the company history… or better said: the company history if the company would&rsquo;ve existed 1000 years ago. Again, I&rsquo;m serious. And they tried to do that using improvisation. Anyone seen improvisational stage play? No? It&rsquo;s like trying to make gold from poo. Never works out. They lost their dignity, and I was looking for co-workers willing to stab me, really. None were to be found, and sadly, noone had drugs at hand neither.</p>
<p>After this motivational nightmare there was a rather lengthy break where almost everyone was trying to convince the others to knock him out or anything. The old &ldquo;please kill me&rdquo; routine &ndash; because we all knew we were only halfway thru.</p>
<p>Anyways, at one point the break was declared over, and we were dragged went back to our seats. They continued to do the improvisation stuff (look to the future yadda yadda yadda), then there was a couple of guys from the company &ndash;
higher levels &ndash; which were showing some typical meeting situations etc.,
which was fun because they were right, and since they were faces we could relate to, it was okay. Silly, but okay. After another 40 minutes or so the improv team took over again, made us pick colored cards from hats and told us that a) yellow cards represent the customer, the red cards represent the holding company and the green cards our own company, and b) we should try to write down what we as (customer|holding|company) expect from the whole merger
/going-back-to-the-holding thing which is currently going on. People did that,
folded the cards, threw them back into the hat. Then these guys take all the cards, mix them and shower them over the stage floor &ndash; and started a <em>totally</em> improvised play by picking up and reading random cards. Basically the <em>idea</em> behind the play was that everyone of them represented one of the aforementioned parties, and the overall scene we had to witness was about a customer asking for a job to be done, a concept to be written, blablabla.</p>
<p>At this point, the dignity was gone. At least theirs, in my eyes. A hundred years ago these folks would have been the property of a circus, leaving in cages. Nowadays they do &ldquo;improvisational stage play&rdquo; or whatever it is called,
making money from it.</p>
<p>Well, to finish up here &ndash; none of these bastards wanted to knock me out, so I had to watch the whole thing. I never thought it was possible to put so much time (and thus money) to waste so easily. We could&rsquo;ve done real work instead.
I mean, really… At least the buffet was good.</p>
<p>Next time I get a mail mentioning a workshop, I&rsquo;ll either call in sick or try to take the day off or anything.</p>

<a href="http://www.minidisc.org/part_Sony_MZ-N710.html">NetMD recorder</a> is crap software with a Flash 5 frontend? This POS called SonicStage is supposed to allow the user to easily transfer music (MP3, CD,
WAV, WMA) to a NetMD player. That&rsquo;s the point: it&rsquo;s <em>supposed</em> to do that.
What you get is a different story. A cluttered interface, a gross insult to usability and an overall disappointing piece of software. I expected quality stuff from Sony; not just in the hardware, but in the software department as well.</p>
<p>(Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I just <strong>love</strong> the hardware.)</p>
<p>To my surprise I found a much more convenient and thought-thru solution in the free <a href="http://www.real.com">RealOne player</a>. The player itself is quite okay, not perfect,
admitted, also there&rsquo;s quite a bunch of fluff noone really needs, but hey -
it&rsquo;s free. I had to install a plugin for Sony music devices support, and <em>that was it</em>. You mark a couple of songs, click &ldquo;copy to Sony&rdquo;, and they&rsquo;ll show up in the NetMD pane, where I can easily copy them to the minidisc device using the USB cable. Good stuff.</p>
<p>And the RealOne also runs quite flawlessly and speedy on Dana&rsquo;s PII 450,
whereas the SonicStage flash app is a real bitch on that machine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never thought I&rsquo;d ever say that, but: Real Networks 1, Sony 0.</p>

<p>Godspeed to the scientists who lost their lives today in their pursuit of bringing our species closer to the stars. May you rest in piece.</p>

			 <p>Everytime I think I&rsquo;ve seen it all, I open another PHP script of that one special co-worker of mine and find myself staring in painful amazement as I read thru the schizophrenic gibberish that is his code. No real structure,
fucked-up yet working hacks built upon older fucked-up yet working hacks, no abstraction at all, and a mess in the first place.</p>
<p>The irony is that in order to rewrite the application (that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to do at the moment) I have to understand what the old code does. Oh, the pain. Days like this one make me wish I was a bagman or a goat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men, looking for the perfect Christmas present? How about giving up pornography? It&rsquo;s the best present you could give your wife this year. […] But the crowning argument against pornography is the damage it does to relationships with loved ones. That is what motivates this particular column. The reason I highlight pornography here is because I keep running into it as a pastor. I keep encountering couples whose marriages have been shaken by the husband&rsquo;s secret &ndash; and, inevitably, discovered &ndash; use of pornography.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feck, I&rsquo;m doomed. :p</p>
<p>Yes, I am interested in porn. Not 24/7, not in every type, but sometimes it&rsquo;s kinda … nice … to have access to the biggest library of free porn on the planet, errm, I mean, to the internet. And let me tell you one thing: I think every man who claims to have never looked at porn, or claims to not find it appealing in some way (mind you, there are several levels and types of porn),
is lying. My opinion. Porn is made by men (mostly) especially for men
(mostly), so it&rsquo;s supposed to appeal mostly to men, on a very subtle level.
There&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it, if it&rsquo;s &ldquo;good&rdquo; pornography (i.e.
delivered in the right way for <em>your</em> subconciousness), your mind and your body will react to it. You can&rsquo;t suppress it, so why bother to try.</p>
<p>I agree that consuming too much porn or the wrong type of porn can be dangerous to a relationship, but hell, it&rsquo;s the same with alcohol or slasher movies. Everything can be dangerous …even seemingly harmless things like fly fishing. If the husband is spending all of his spare time on the river fishing, or in front of the TV filling himself up with barrels of bad american pseudo-beer, his wife might actually leave him after a while. Recap: Yes, porn can be a threat to a relationship, but there are a lot of things it can&rsquo;t do.
It might be able to give you a cheap kick, but it&rsquo;ll never be as good as the real thing, and it&rsquo;ll never replace the love in a relationship. It&rsquo;s cool every now and then, but if has priority over making love with your better half, then you have other problems anyways and should see a psychiatrist. ;)</p>
<p>Talking freely with your wife about watching porn every now and then might help as well. I do - it&rsquo;s nothing wrong with watching bad actors having idiotic lines (favourite quote: &ldquo;Uuuuh, now what do we have here?&rdquo; - it&rsquo;s your damn job to <em>know</em> for sure, stupid!) and making out, as long as you stay within healthy boundaries.</p>
<p>So, porn is nothing more like a tool you <em>can</em> use to get a cheap kick, but it&rsquo;s definitely not the devil per se and this article is pathetic. :P</p>

			 <p>Just got an internal job opening in my office mailbox. Looks like my boss is leaving the company. Now wouldn&rsquo;t that be nice I he would&rsquo;ve told us face-to-
face… we (the department and he) had an excellent relationship, until we were moved around - and he got a separate office in another part of the building.
Things went downhill from there. Did he lose &ldquo;contact with the base&rdquo;? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s leaving, hell no. Everyone has to find the right space for her-/himself, but it&rsquo;d be nice I wouldn&rsquo;t learn it from a frickin' &ldquo;internal job opening&rdquo; mail.</p>
<p>In other notes: my throat is sore and Dana asked me to explain some algebra to her in the evening. I&rsquo;ve forgotten almost everything algebra myself (been a long time since I learned it in school), so I gotta teach myself before I&rsquo;ll be able to explain <em>anything</em>. Heh.</p>
