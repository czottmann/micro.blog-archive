It&rsquo;s basically just a more or less random list of hilarious observations and one-liners; this description makes it sound more disjointed than it actually is. Good stuff.</p>\n<p>🎮 <a href=\"https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny\">Destiny 2</a> – After 2+ years of absence, I picked up the so-called &ldquo;Legacy Collections&rdquo;, containing yester-years' three big DLCs (Shadowkeep, Beyond Light, The Witch Queen), and am solo&rsquo;ing my way through them. It&rsquo;s still Destiny, for sure, even though they&rsquo;ve changed a lot over the years. I&rsquo;m having fun, 15€ well spent. I&rsquo;m currently in the first chapters of the Witch Queen DLC, and it&rsquo;s pretty nice! Haven&rsquo;t decided yet whether to buy Lightfall after that, or The Final Shape.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theoutline.com/post/7886/ursula-le-guin-carrier-bag-theory\">We should all be reading more Ursula Le Guin | The Outline</a> – I love the idea, the whole mindset. <em>&ldquo;The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction […] disputes the idea that the spear was the earliest human tool, proposing that it was actually the receptacle. Questioning the spear’s phallic, murderous logic, instead Le Guin tells the story of the carrier bag, the sling, the shell, or the gourd. In this empty vessel, early humans could carry more than can be held in the hand and, therefore, gather food for later. Anyone who consistently forgets to bring their tote bag to the supermarket knows how significant this is. And besides, Le Guin writes, the idea that the spear came before the vessel doesn’t even make sense.&quot;</em> I need to check my local library  for some of ULG&rsquo;s books.</p>\n<p>📚 <a href=\"https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/876fb0d6-74cb-4636-a93c-9f43a8585c0c\">&ldquo;Leave the World Behind&rdquo; by Rumaan Alam</a> – What a courageous book. As in: I think it takes a certain kind of courage to call it a day when your book is only 2/3 done. It wasn&rsquo;t a terrible read, but I felt like it was making promises all the time it couldn&rsquo;t keep. Both book blurbs and the related movie trailer made it sound quite VanderMeer’ian – I was expecting some New Weird, but it isn&rsquo;t that.

Not much, this time; I am/was working a lot, [new macOS app and all](https://actions.work/ui-actions).\n\n---\n\n[Late Night with Seth Meyers on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@LateNightSeth) – Love it. When he talks about \"jackals\", I feel wholly included, which either tells you everything you need to know about my sense of humor, or nothing at all.\n\n🎤 [\"Live (At the Time)\" by Demetri Martin](https://tidal.com/browse/album/338655462) – I had a blast listening to this stand-up special, but it's a different form than what I'm used to. It's basically just a more or less random list of hilarious observations and one-liners; this description makes it sound more disjointed than it actually is. Good stuff.\n\n🎮 [Destiny 2](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny) – After 2+ years of absence, I picked up the so-called \"Legacy Collections\", containing yester-years' three big DLCs (Shadowkeep, Beyond Light, The Witch Queen), and am solo'ing my way through them. It's still Destiny, for sure, even though they've changed a lot over the years. I'm having fun, 15€ well spent. I'm currently in the first chapters of the Witch Queen DLC, and it's pretty nice! Haven't decided yet whether to buy Lightfall after that, or The Final Shape.\n\n[We should all be reading more Ursula Le Guin | The Outline](https://theoutline.com/post/7886/ursula-le-guin-carrier-bag-theory) – I love the idea, the whole mindset. _\"The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction […] disputes the idea that the spear was the earliest human tool, proposing that it was actually the receptacle. Questioning the spear’s phallic, murderous logic, instead Le Guin tells the story of the carrier bag, the sling, the shell, or the gourd. In this empty vessel, early humans could carry more than can be held in the hand and, therefore, gather food for later. Anyone who consistently forgets to bring their tote bag to the supermarket knows how significant this is. And besides, Le Guin writes, the idea that the spear came before the vessel doesn’t even make sense.\"_ I need to check my local library  for some of ULG's books.\n\n📚 [\"Leave the World Behind\" by Rumaan Alam](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/876fb0d6-74cb-4636-a93c-9f43a8585c0c) – What a courageous book. As in: I think it takes a certain kind of courage to call it a day when your book is only 2/3 done. It wasn't a terrible read, but I felt like it was making promises all the time it couldn't keep. Both book blurbs and the related movie trailer made it sound quite VanderMeer’ian – I was expecting some New Weird, but it isn't that. In fact, I'm not sure *what* that book even wants to be. There's a lot of spooky foreshadowing both by the narrator (\"the trees knew\", \"old folks know\", \"kids can hear ghosts\" etc.) and dramatic plot points (people getting sick etc.), and nothing. comes. of. it. And then it ends. It just ends.  (C)\n\n🎤 [\"People Make Mistakes\" by J.F.

				"content_html": "<p>Unsere Corona-Infektionen sind überstanden: jeweils <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4 Nächte<!-- raw HTML omitted --> mit Fieber und dazwischen Tage, die typisch sind für heftige Erkältungen, und welche uns dann auch nach dem abschliessenden negativen Test noch eine gute Woche erhalten blieben.  Alles in Allem fühlte es sich an wie eine g&rsquo;scheite Grippe, nicht mehr und nicht weniger.  Mein Verstand sagt mir, dass die bisherigen vier COVID-Impfungen eine gute Idee waren.  Danke, Medizin!</p>\n<p>Wenn möglich, je nach Tagesverfassung, habe ich auch in der Krankheitszeit meine Runden durch die Hood gedreht.  Isolieren kann ich mich auch an der frischen Luft, mit gesundem Abstand zu anderen Menschen.  Meine Eltern waren in der Stadt, und auch wenn wir uns nicht umarmen oder ihnen unsere Wohnung zeigen konnten — dank Sonnenwetter mit steifem Wind waren wenigstens ein paar Spaziergänge und Gespräche <!-- raw HTML omitted -->drin. 🎉<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Langsam macht sich der Herbst an der Förde breit, und das sonnige Sommerwetter wird immer öfter unterbrochen von kurzen Schauern.  (Mir scheint, das Venn-Diagramm &ldquo;Jahreszeiten an der dänischen Grenze&rdquo; hat nur sehr knappe Überschneidungen, und die Übergangszeiten bemessen sich in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stunden. 😉)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Unser erster Herbst hier oben!  Aufregend.</p>\n<p>Die Ostsee hat ja weder Ebbe noch Flut, was ich sehr schätze.  (Meere wie die Nordsee werben zwar damit, die &ldquo;echte See&rdquo; zu sein, aber was bekommt man dort wirklich?  Die Hälfte der Zeit gibt es nur die Hälfte vom Meer — und niemand hinterfragt diesen etwas zweifelhaften Arbeitsethos?  C&rsquo;mon.)  Aber: starker Westwind kann das Wasser aus der Förde in die Ostsee schieben, was zu leeren Hafenbecken<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> oder auch zu trockengelegten Stränden führen kann.  Letzteres passiert gerade in der stürmischen Saison des Öfteren.  Als ich das das erste Mal unvorbereitet sah, hat es mich ziemlich verwirrt.</p>\n<p>Erste Vermutung: der Zar hat russische Militärkampftrinker nach <!-- raw HTML omitted -->St. Petersburg<!-- raw HTML omitted --> geordert, damit sie die Ostsee strategisch leerschlürfen.  Aber nope: nur das Wetter.  Und auch wenn ich weiß, dass die Solitüde-Strandabschnitte sehr flach sind — ich finde das Zusammenspiel der Naturgewalten beeindruckend: <em>Der Wind drückt über Stunden hinweg gigantische Wassermengen aus der Förde hinaus und sorgt für einen 10-15cm niedrigeren</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>Wasserstand.</em> 🤯<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Aber der Anblick macht mich an manchen Tagen auch etwas traurig, weiß ich doch, dass sich all das rapide verändert. Studien prognostizieren aufgrund der hausgemachten Grönland-Eisschmelze einen Anstieg des Meeresspiegels von <!-- raw HTML omitted -->27 bis 78cm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bis 2100<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>, <strong>hinzu</strong> kommt das Abschmelzen des ostantarktischen Eisschildes, welches einen Anstieg von ~5m bis 2300 ausmachen wird.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>  Selbst wenn wir heute unseren CO2-Ausstoß einfrieren <em>könnten</em>, die Veränderung auf planetarer Ebene ist schon in vollem Gange.</p>\n<p>Und so ziehe ich im Kopf sehr oft schon die Wasserlinie neu, wenn ich am Ufer entlang laufe.  Auch, wenn ich das eigentlich gar nicht möchte; aber es ist, wie es ist, sagt mein gelernter Gleichmut.</p>\n<p>Tja, stürmische Gedanken an herbstlichen Tagen.

				"content_text": "Unsere Corona-Infektionen sind überstanden: jeweils <nobr>4 Nächte</nobr> mit Fieber und dazwischen Tage, die typisch sind für heftige Erkältungen, und welche uns dann auch nach dem abschliessenden negativen Test noch eine gute Woche erhalten blieben.  Alles in Allem fühlte es sich an wie eine g'scheite Grippe, nicht mehr und nicht weniger.  Mein Verstand sagt mir, dass die bisherigen vier COVID-Impfungen eine gute Idee waren.  Danke, Medizin!\n\nWenn möglich, je nach Tagesverfassung, habe ich auch in der Krankheitszeit meine Runden durch die Hood gedreht.  Isolieren kann ich mich auch an der frischen Luft, mit gesundem Abstand zu anderen Menschen.  Meine Eltern waren in der Stadt, und auch wenn wir uns nicht umarmen oder ihnen unsere Wohnung zeigen konnten — dank Sonnenwetter mit steifem Wind waren wenigstens ein paar Spaziergänge und Gespräche <nobr>drin. 🎉</nobr>\n\nLangsam macht sich der Herbst an der Förde breit, und das sonnige Sommerwetter wird immer öfter unterbrochen von kurzen Schauern.  (Mir scheint, das Venn-Diagramm \"Jahreszeiten an der dänischen Grenze\" hat nur sehr knappe Überschneidungen, und die Übergangszeiten bemessen sich in <nobr>Stunden. 😉)</nobr> Unser erster Herbst hier oben!  Aufregend.  \n\nDie Ostsee hat ja weder Ebbe noch Flut, was ich sehr schätze.  (Meere wie die Nordsee werben zwar damit, die \"echte See\" zu sein, aber was bekommt man dort wirklich?  Die Hälfte der Zeit gibt es nur die Hälfte vom Meer — und niemand hinterfragt diesen etwas zweifelhaften Arbeitsethos?  C'mon.)  Aber: starker Westwind kann das Wasser aus der Förde in die Ostsee schieben, was zu leeren Hafenbecken[^1] oder auch zu trockengelegten Stränden führen kann.  Letzteres passiert gerade in der stürmischen Saison des Öfteren.  Als ich das das erste Mal unvorbereitet sah, hat es mich ziemlich verwirrt.\n\n[^1]: [foerde.news: \"Sturmtief Mirella pustet Wasser aus dem Hafenbecken\"](https://www.foerde.news/news/sturmtief-mirella-pustet-wasser-aus-dem-hafenbecken.html).\n\nErste Vermutung: der Zar hat russische Militärkampftrinker nach <nobr>St. Petersburg</nobr> geordert, damit sie die Ostsee strategisch leerschlürfen.  Aber nope: nur das Wetter.  Und auch wenn ich weiß, dass die Solitüde-Strandabschnitte sehr flach sind — ich finde das Zusammenspiel der Naturgewalten beeindruckend: _Der Wind drückt über Stunden hinweg gigantische Wassermengen aus der Förde hinaus und sorgt für einen 10-15cm niedrigeren_ <nobr>_Wasserstand._ 🤯</nobr>\n\n<figure class=\"fullwidth\">\n  <img \n    src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2022/aba50b0a5c.jpg\"\n    alt=\"Foto vom Fördestrand, links ohne und rechts mit Markierungen des üblichen Wasserstands\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>\n    Foto vom Strandbad Solitüde, links ohne und rechts mit Markierungen des üblichen Wasserstands\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAber der Anblick macht mich an manchen Tagen auch etwas traurig, weiß ich doch, dass sich all das rapide verändert. Studien prognostizieren aufgrund der hausgemachten Grönland-Eisschmelze einen Anstieg des Meeresspiegels von <nobr>27 bis 78cm</nobr> bis 2100[^2], **hinzu** kommt das Abschmelzen des ostantarktischen Eisschildes, welches einen Anstieg von ~5m bis 2300 ausmachen wird.[^3]  Selbst wenn wir heute unseren CO2-Ausstoß einfrieren _könnten_, die Veränderung auf planetarer Ebene ist schon in vollem Gange.\n\n[^2]: [Deutschlandfunk: \"Gletscherschwund auf Grönland: Forscher korrigieren Prognose für Meeresspiegelanstieg nach oben\"](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/groenlands-eisschild-laesst-meeresspiegel-um-mindestens-27-zentimeter-steigen-100.html)\n[^3]: [FAZ: \"Der sensible Eispanzer der Antarktis\"](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wissen/erde-klima/klimawandel-an-der-antarktis-wie-schnell-schmelzen-eisschilde-18246843.html). Die FAZ schreibt _\"Würde das in Paris vereinbarte Zwei-Grad-Ziel nicht erreicht, könnten erhebliche Teile der Ostantarktis schmelzen\"_ — ich bin mir sicher, der Konjunktiv ist fehl am Platz.\n\nUnd so ziehe ich im Kopf sehr oft schon die Wasserlinie neu, wenn ich am Ufer entlang laufe.  Auch, wenn ich das eigentlich gar nicht möchte; aber es ist, wie es ist, sagt mein gelernter Gleichmut.\n\nTja, stürmische Gedanken an herbstlichen Tagen.  Was die Klimakrise tatsächlich bewirkt, das habe ich erst wirklich verstanden, als ich nicht mehr in einer Großstadt wohnte.  Ich mag Großstädte, sie haben oft viel zu bieten, aber sie nehmen uns auch den dauerhaften direkten Bezug zur Natur.

Der traurige Blick der verwaisten und verschlossenen Geschäfte folgt den Besucher:innen, die durch Große Straße, Holm und Norderstraße schlendern. Das ist ein grundsätzliches Problem wie in vielen anderen Städten auch; wenn sich der Leerstand ausbreitet, wird die Gegend unattraktiver für die Anwohner, die zivile Gesellschaft und Geschäftstreibende.\n\nWie ich in dieser Woche bei einem spontanen Besuch in der coolen kleinen Urbanica Art Gallery[^1] im schnieken Käthe-Lassen-Hof erfahren durfte, investiert Flensburg in eine Abteilung Innenstadtmanagement!  Dieses hat die Aktion [\"Deine Innenstadt, Deine Ideen\"](https://www.flensburg.de/deine-ideen/) ausgerufen, und in der Urbanica einen entsprechenden Workshop veranstaltet.  Mit 630.000€ im Fördertopf sucht FL nach neuen Ideen, um seinen Kern zu beleben.  Ich kam schnell mit Emin (Urbanica + ein halbes Dutzend andere Ventures) und Bela, Jenny & Sönke (Stadt FL) ins Gespräch über Möglichkeiten, Ideen und gesellschaftliche Fragen (_\"Wem gehört die Stadt, der öffentliche Raum?\"_ etc.).  Gute Themen!\n\n[^1]: [Web](https://www.urbanica-art.com/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/urbanica.art.gallery/).\n\nMein Lamento _\"Mir fehlt Co-Working in der Stadtmitte\"_ beantwortete Bela grinsend mit _\"Wir helfen Dir mit den Anträgen, wenn Du selbst einen Space eröffnen willst!!\"_. Will ich? Uh… nicht im Moment, aber gut zu wissen, <nobr>danke! 😉</nobr>\n\nAussagen wie diese trugen zum Eindruck bei, den ich aus diesen 2h mitgenommen habe: hier sind Menschen, die tatsächlich an Ideen und Brainstorming interessiert sind; die helfen wollen, Projekte auf die Straße zu bringen; und die unsere Stadt dabei nicht zwangsläufig als Initiatorin, aber definitiv als Möglichmacherin <nobr>sehen. 👍🏼</nobr>\n\nUnd ja: nur Förde, Flens-Brauerei und Fahrzeugbau allein reichen nicht aus, um eine prosperierende, attraktive und lebenswerte Stadt zu erhalten.  Was diese auch anerkennt und aktiv vorantreibt, mit dem [\"Flensburg 2030\"-Stadtentwicklungsprozess](https://www.flensburg.de/Flensburg-2030/) und dem Bekenntnis zur Neuen Leipzig Charta[^2]: sie will **grün** (ökologisch, umweltfreundlich), **gerecht** (sozial) und **nachhaltig-produktiv** (ökonomisch) bleiben und/oder werden.  3 von 3, genau mein Ding!\n\n[^2]: Lesenswert: [\"Die Neue Leipzig-Charta ist das Leitdokument für gemeinwohlorientierte Stadtentwicklung in Europa. Sie formuliert konkrete Handlungsdimensionen und Schlüsselprinzipien guter Stadtpolitik.\"](https://www.nationale-stadtentwicklungspolitik.de/NSPWeb/DE/Initiative/Leipzig-Charta/Neue-Leipzig-Charta-2020/neue-leipzig-charta-2020.html;jsessionid=1F59DF5737FB692D61E9B28108FF1D51.live21324)\n\n<hr/>\n\n*Dieser Post ist Teil [meines \"Fresh in Flensburg\"-Newsletters](https://flensburg.life).  Ab Mitte April 2022 schreibe ich für knapp 6 Monate jede Woche eine Mail mit Eindrücken, Erlebnissen und vielleicht auch Fotos zu und aus \"meiner\" neuen Stadt.

Ich glaube, hier wird es auch nicht so wahnsinnig heiß, wegen Ost- und Nordsee nebenan, es wird weniger extreme Ausschläge geben, was glaubst Du?&quot;</em> — <em>&ldquo;Sehe ich genau so, let&rsquo;s do this!&quot;</em></p>\n<p>August 2022: <em>&ldquo;Holy shit, es ist bitte WIE HEIß in München‽ Ist Dir klar, dass wir auf eine gewisse Art Klimaflüchtlinge sind‽ 😳&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>Wenn ich dieser Tage auf die Wetterkarte von Deutschland schaue, sehe ich tiefrote Zahlen.  Wälder brennen und vertrocknen; der Harz (wo ich geboren bin und wo meine Blutfamilie wohnt) ist in großen Teilen nahezu kahl, dahingerafft von jahrzehntelanger Monokultur, von Trockenheit und von Borkenkäfern in einer fatalen Abfolge.  Große Flüsse und Seen trocknen rapide aus, und Süddeutschland erreicht teilweise subtropische Temperaturen.  Die Wetterextreme rund ums Jahr werden härter, das haben wir selbst die letzten zehn Jahre schon in München beobachtet.  Trinkwasser wird auch hierzulande öfters knapp.</p>\n<p>Wir als Menschheit sind in der Phase angelangt, in der das Fortschreiten der exponentiellen Klimaveränderungen spürbar wird, und ich will nicht lügen: Es macht mir Angst.  Nur Idioten haben keine Angst davor.  Ohne Übertreibung: ich bange um die Meinen südlich von mir, und hoffe, dass sie die wachsenden Extreme weiter gut überstehen werden.  Das wird nichts, was man aussitzen kann, dies ist nun unser ständiger Begleiter.  Dana und ich nehmen die Veränderungen schon seit Jahren wahr, wie viele andere aufmerksame Menschen auch, nur werden sie zunehmend drastischer.</p>\n<p>Aber unsere Einschätzung hat sich bisher bewahrheitet; auch hier wird es warm und teils auch heiß, ja, aber die nördlichen Meere fangen Einiges ab, gleichen die harten Ausschläge noch aus.  Und auch wenn ich die Sonne und den Sommer echt mag und geniesse: Die Stimme im Hinterkopf gibt keine Ruh'.  Ich weiß, dass sie Teil eines Chores ist, dass nicht nur ich diese Stimme im Kopf höre, nur verbessert das halt die Situation nicht.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Trotzdem bleibt mein Optimismus, auch wenn er es schwerer hat als noch vor 5–10 Jahren.  Vor vielen Jahren habe ich ein Interview mit dem Autor <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson\">Kim Stanley Robinson</a> gelesen<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>, in dem er ungefähr Folgendes gesagt hat: <em>&ldquo;As a species, we must be optimistic, because we can&rsquo;t <strong>afford</strong> to be pessimistic&rdquo;</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>  Das kann ich nicht vergessen, es ist für mich so ein Leuchtturm-Satz geworden — etwas, das mich leitet.</p>\n<p>Optimismus für mich ist das Benennen der Realität, egal wie gut oder schlecht, verbunden mit der Hoffnung auf Verbesserung, und dem Anerkennen, dass diese sicher nicht ohne aktives Bemühen erreicht wird — aber dass sie erreicht werden <em>kann</em>.  (Pessimismus dagegen ist Stagnation, das <em>&ldquo;Es wird eh nichts mehr, also warum sich bemühen?&quot;</em> — fatal.)</p>\n<p>Ja, die Realität könnte echt besser sein.  Klimakrise, Waldsterben, Pandemien.  Aber eben auch: weltweit <strong>endlich</strong> mehr Energie (ahem) beim Ausbau der Erneuerbaren, Geld für die Erforschung neuer nachhaltigerer Energiequellen, eine Renaissance in Medizin und Biotechnologie.  <strong>Wir werden überleben,</strong> auch wenn niemand sagen kann, wie die Welt dann in 50–100 Jahren aussehen wird, und wie hart die Zeit bis dahin wird.</p>\n<p>Ich werde meinen Teil dazu beitragen, klein oder groß, aber dazu muss ich (biologisch) funktionieren, und das kann ich besser bei kühleren Temperaturen.  Und vielleicht bedeutet das in ein paar Jahren einen weiteren Umzug — mal sehen.</p>\n<p>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaanyways.</p>\n<p>Ich komme vermutlich demnächst an den Punkt, an dem ich <a href=\"/2022/08/07/fresh-in-flensburg.html\">genug Brombeeren</a> hatte.  Never thought I&rsquo;d see the day.</p>\n<p>Oh, und lest mehr Kim Stanley Robinson!  Er schreibt optimistische Science Fiction (Optimismus wie von mir beschrieben).  Oft spielen die Handlungen in der nahen Zukunft, er extrapoliert dafür sehr gekonnt Entwicklungen und Probleme im Heute, zeigt Auswirkungen und auch immer mögliche Lösungen auf, gepaart mit viel Hoffnung und Ideen.

Wälder brennen und vertrocknen; der Harz (wo ich geboren bin und wo meine Blutfamilie wohnt) ist in großen Teilen nahezu kahl, dahingerafft von jahrzehntelanger Monokultur, von Trockenheit und von Borkenkäfern in einer fatalen Abfolge.  Große Flüsse und Seen trocknen rapide aus, und Süddeutschland erreicht teilweise subtropische Temperaturen.  Die Wetterextreme rund ums Jahr werden härter, das haben wir selbst die letzten zehn Jahre schon in München beobachtet.  Trinkwasser wird auch hierzulande öfters knapp.\n\nWir als Menschheit sind in der Phase angelangt, in der das Fortschreiten der exponentiellen Klimaveränderungen spürbar wird, und ich will nicht lügen: Es macht mir Angst.  Nur Idioten haben keine Angst davor.  Ohne Übertreibung: ich bange um die Meinen südlich von mir, und hoffe, dass sie die wachsenden Extreme weiter gut überstehen werden.  Das wird nichts, was man aussitzen kann, dies ist nun unser ständiger Begleiter.  Dana und ich nehmen die Veränderungen schon seit Jahren wahr, wie viele andere aufmerksame Menschen auch, nur werden sie zunehmend drastischer.\n\nAber unsere Einschätzung hat sich bisher bewahrheitet; auch hier wird es warm und teils auch heiß, ja, aber die nördlichen Meere fangen Einiges ab, gleichen die harten Ausschläge noch aus.  Und auch wenn ich die Sonne und den Sommer echt mag und geniesse: Die Stimme im Hinterkopf gibt keine Ruh'.  Ich weiß, dass sie Teil eines Chores ist, dass nicht nur ich diese Stimme im Kopf höre, nur verbessert das halt die Situation nicht.\n\n<figure class=\"fullwidth\">\n  <img \n    src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2022/1e602655e9.jpg\"\n    alt=\"Foto-Kollage: links ein voller Brombeerbusch; rechts Blick über die Flensburger Förde mit einer Möwe auf einem Stein, dahinter ein Segelboot, in der Ferne die dänische Küste\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>\n      <strong>\n        Heisser Sommer:\n      </strong>\n      Die Brombeeren wachsen wie Unkraut, und die Flensburger Förde ist immer noch der beste Platz, um runterzukühlen und Energie zu tanken\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nTrotzdem bleibt mein Optimismus, auch wenn er es schwerer hat als noch vor 5–10 Jahren.  Vor vielen Jahren habe ich ein Interview mit dem Autor [Kim Stanley Robinson](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson) gelesen[^2], in dem er ungefähr Folgendes gesagt hat: _\"As a species, we must be optimistic, because we can't **afford** to be pessimistic\"_.[^3]  Das kann ich nicht vergessen, es ist für mich so ein Leuchtturm-Satz geworden — etwas, das mich leitet.\n\n[^2]: Ich bin mir _sicher_, es war KSR, aber nachdem ich das Interview nicht mehr finde, kann ich es nicht verifizieren. Sorry.\n[^3]: _\"Als Spezies müssen wir optimistisch sein, denn wir können uns Pessimismus nicht **leisten**.\"_\n\nOptimismus für mich ist das Benennen der Realität, egal wie gut oder schlecht, verbunden mit der Hoffnung auf Verbesserung, und dem Anerkennen, dass diese sicher nicht ohne aktives Bemühen erreicht wird — aber dass sie erreicht werden _kann_.  (Pessimismus dagegen ist Stagnation, das _\"Es wird eh nichts mehr, also warum sich bemühen?\"_ — fatal.)\n\nJa, die Realität könnte echt besser sein.  Klimakrise, Waldsterben, Pandemien.  Aber eben auch: weltweit **endlich** mehr Energie (ahem) beim Ausbau der Erneuerbaren, Geld für die Erforschung neuer nachhaltigerer Energiequellen, eine Renaissance in Medizin und Biotechnologie.  **Wir werden überleben,** auch wenn niemand sagen kann, wie die Welt dann in 50–100 Jahren aussehen wird, und wie hart die Zeit bis dahin wird.\n\nIch werde meinen Teil dazu beitragen, klein oder groß, aber dazu muss ich (biologisch) funktionieren, und das kann ich besser bei kühleren Temperaturen.  Und vielleicht bedeutet das in ein paar Jahren einen weiteren Umzug — mal sehen.\n\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaanyways. \n\nIch komme vermutlich demnächst an den Punkt, an dem ich [genug Brombeeren](/2022/08/07/fresh-in-flensburg.html) hatte.  Never thought I'd see the day.\n\nOh, und lest mehr Kim Stanley Robinson!  Er schreibt optimistische Science Fiction (Optimismus wie von mir beschrieben).  Oft spielen die Handlungen in der nahen Zukunft, er extrapoliert dafür sehr gekonnt Entwicklungen und Probleme im Heute, zeigt Auswirkungen und auch immer mögliche Lösungen auf, gepaart mit viel Hoffnung und Ideen. Much, much love.\n\n<hr/>\n\n*Dieser Post ist Teil [meines \"Fresh in Flensburg\"-Newsletters](https://flensburg.life).

				"title": "How to use cross-island state management in Deno Fresh",
				"content_html": "<p>(This is just a quick write-up since the question/ topic came up on the Deno Fresh discussion board (<a href=\"https://github.com/denoland/fresh/discussions/230\">&ldquo;State sharing between islands&rdquo;</a>) to which I wrote a short reply. I felt like elaborating here. The examples are stripped to bare minimum, so there&rsquo;ll be no TS definitions and no import maps.)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2022/ec82456afa.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of the first piece of code from the text\"></p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve built a new site using the wonderful <a href=\"https://fresh.deno.dev/\">Deno Fresh</a> web framework.  You have a number of unconnected islands all over the place and now want them to interact with eachother without resorting to hacks like passing data around using some key on the <code>window</code> object.  <strong>In my personal experience</strong> the best way to do that is by using some sort of state management — using a <em>reactive</em> store of arbitrary data.</p>\n<p>There are a number of options here (Zustand, Redux, mobx etc. come to mind) but my preferred go-to is <a href=\"https://github.com/hmans/statery\">Statery</a> by my guy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hmans\">@hmans</a>.</p>\n<p>Statery bills itself as &ldquo;Surprise-Free State Management&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s 100% true. It does offer a store, the bare minimum of necessities to make that store and its state reactive, and then sends you on your merry way.  Personally, I prefer that approach over the usual <em>&ldquo;does everything (and your mom)&quot;</em> — do one thing, and do it right.  Statery nails that part.</p>\n<p>So, how do I set up a store and make two (or more) components share state?</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, a Statery store is just a JS module containing a variable which holds your state data.  If you want persistance you&rsquo;ll have to add it yourself. Also, you can have several separate stores doing different things.</p>\n<p><em>Side note regarding persistance: For example, in my current app one store contains <a href=\"https://github.com/hmans/statery#subscribing-to-updates-imperatively\">a simple subscriber</a> storing the current state to the visitor&rsquo;s local storage; when the visitor returns at a later date, during its initialization the store checks <code>window.localStorage</code> for existing store data and uses that to hydrate the store.</em></p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s consider <code>./stores/whatever_store.ts</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-typescript\" data-lang=\"typescript\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">import</span> {\n  <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">makeStore</span>,\n  <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">useStore</span>,\n} <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">from</span> <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;https://esm.sh/statery@0.5.4?alias=react:preact/compat&amp;deps=preact@10.8.2&#34;</span>;\n\n<span style=\"color:#75715e\">/* Make a store */</span>\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">const</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">store</span> <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">makeStore</span>({ <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">counter</span>: <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">0</span> });\n\n<span style=\"color:#75715e\">/* Write some code that updates it */</span>\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">export</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">const</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">incrementCount</span> <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> () <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=&gt;</span>\n  <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">store</span>.<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">set</span>((<span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">state</span>) <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=&gt;</span> ({\n    <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">counter</span>: <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">state.counter</span> <span style=\"color:#f92672\">+</span> <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">1</span>,\n  }));\n\n<span style=\"color:#75715e\">/**\n</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"> * A wee bit of abstraction so my components don&#39;t need to\n</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"> * import `useState` from Statery\n</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"> */</span>\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">export</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">const</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">state</span> <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> () <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=&gt;</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">useStore</span>(<span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">store</span>);\n</code></pre></div><p><em>Side note: notice the import URL here, <a href=\"https://zottmann.org/2022/07/19/til-how-to.html\">telling ESM to substitute its React dependency with Preact 10.8.2 on the fly</a> — which is what Fresh comes with.</em></p>\n<p>The store is created only once the first time the module is loaded/ initialized, all the exports use it when called.

				"content_text": "(This is just a quick write-up since the question/ topic came up on the Deno Fresh discussion board ([\"State sharing between islands\"](https://github.com/denoland/fresh/discussions/230)) to which I wrote a short reply. I felt like elaborating here. The examples are stripped to bare minimum, so there'll be no TS definitions and no import maps.)\n\n![Screenshot of the first piece of code from the text](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2022/ec82456afa.jpg)\n\nLet's say you've built a new site using the wonderful [Deno Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) web framework.  You have a number of unconnected islands all over the place and now want them to interact with eachother without resorting to hacks like passing data around using some key on the `window` object.  **In my personal experience** the best way to do that is by using some sort of state management — using a *reactive* store of arbitrary data.\n\nThere are a number of options here (Zustand, Redux, mobx etc. come to mind) but my preferred go-to is [Statery](https://github.com/hmans/statery) by my guy [@hmans](https://twitter.com/hmans).\n\nStatery bills itself as \"Surprise-Free State Management\" and it's 100% true. It does offer a store, the bare minimum of necessities to make that store and its state reactive, and then sends you on your merry way.  Personally, I prefer that approach over the usual *\"does everything (and your mom)\"* — do one thing, and do it right.  Statery nails that part.\n\nSo, how do I set up a store and make two (or more) components share state?\n\nIn a nutshell, a Statery store is just a JS module containing a variable which holds your state data.  If you want persistance you'll have to add it yourself. Also, you can have several separate stores doing different things.\n\n*Side note regarding persistance: For example, in my current app one store contains [a simple subscriber](https://github.com/hmans/statery#subscribing-to-updates-imperatively) storing the current state to the visitor's local storage; when the visitor returns at a later date, during its initialization the store checks `window.localStorage` for existing store data and uses that to hydrate the store.*\n\nLet's consider `./stores/whatever_store.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport {\n  makeStore,\n  useStore,\n} from \"https://esm.sh/statery@0.5.4?alias=react:preact/compat&deps=preact@10.8.2\";\n\n/* Make a store */\nconst store = makeStore({ counter: 0 });\n\n/* Write some code that updates it */\nexport const incrementCount = () =>\n  store.set((state) => ({\n    counter: state.counter + 1,\n  }));\n\n/**\n * A wee bit of abstraction so my components don't need to\n * import `useState` from Statery\n */\nexport const state = () => useStore(store);\n```\n\n*Side note: notice the import URL here, [telling ESM to substitute its React dependency with Preact 10.8.2 on the fly](https://zottmann.org/2022/07/19/til-how-to.html) — which is what Fresh comes with.*\n\nThe store is created only once the first time the module is loaded/ initialized, all the exports use it when called.  Therefore all components using that particular store module access the same data, not different instances.\n\nNext, let's write two components, `./island/StoreUsingComponent1.tsx`:\n\n```typescript\n/** @jsx h */\nimport { h } from \"preact\";\nimport { incrementCount, state } from \"../stores/whatever_store.ts\";\n\nexport default function StoreUsingComponent1() {\n  const { counter } = state();\n\n  return (\n    <p>\n      <button onClick={incrementCount}>\n        Increment number (clicked {counter} times)\n      </button>\n    </p>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n… and `./island/StoreUsingComponent2.tsx`:\n\n```typescript\n/** @jsx h */\nimport { h } from \"preact\";\nimport { state } from \"../stores/whatever_store.ts\";\n\nexport default function StoreUsingComponent2() {\n  const { counter } = state();\n\n  return <p>Current counter value: {counter}</p>;\n}\n```\n\nLastly, call them from a route or another island:\n\n```typescript\n/** @jsx h */\nimport { h } from \"preact\";\nimport StoreUsingComponent1 from \"../islands/StoreUsingComponent1.tsx\";\nimport StoreUsingComponent2 from \"../islands/StoreUsingComponent2.tsx\";\n\nexport default function Demo() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <StoreUsingComponent1 />\n      <StoreUsingComponent2 />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nAnd that's all there is.  Now when you click the button (located in `StoreUsingComponent1.tsx`) the text displayed by `StoreUsingComponent2.tsx` will change.\n\nYou could do the same thing w/ Zustand or any other state management library, of course.  I just happen to prefer [Statery](https://github.com/hmans/statery)'s sane and super-reduced API.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Während wir 2017-2020 das noch junge RECUP aufbauten, mit all den Experimenten für ein besseres Miteinander im Arbeitsalltag, mit den ersten offenen Gehaltsrunden im gesamten Team <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>, mit dem Anspruch von maximalmöglicher interner Transparenz, mit der fehlenden oberen Begrenzung des jährlichen Urlaubsanspruches (a.k.a. <em>&ldquo;nimm Urlaub, so viel Du möchtest&rdquo;</em>) etc. — damals sagte ich mehr als einmal im Scherz zu meinen Leuten <em>&ldquo;Alle, die hier anfangen, werden für ihr weiteres Berufsleben komplett versaut&rdquo;</em>, weil ich aus Erfahrung wusste, dass wir sehr viele Dinge (bewusst) anders machten als die meisten anderen deutschen Startups und Unternehmen.</p>\n<p>Und… ich hatte Recht damit.  <strong>Ich fühle mich versaut für die Jobs und Gigs, die da noch kommen werden.</strong>  Es waren fünf Jahre mit sehr viel Arbeit — mit sehr <em>sehr</em> viel Arbeit —, in denen ich echt viel gelernt und mega viel Freude erfahren habe als Teil einer großen Herde von Qualitätsmenschen.  Die Kehrseite: die volle Identifikation mit der eigenen Firma und die feste Überzeugung, etwas wirklich Wichtiges zu tun, ließ mich auch vergessen, öfters mal abzuschalten und nach der Startup-Phase eine gesunde Balance zwischen Arbeit und dem eigenen Ich wiederherzustellen.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Seit wir im vor drei Monaten im April 2022 die Stadtwerke Flensburg als unseren Stromversorger ausgewählt haben, sind die Preise für die Kilowatt-Stunde um ~17% gestiegen.  Unser aktueller Preis ist für 12 Monate fixiert auf 50,07 ct/kWh, aber … you know.  Die neue Klimarealität, die wirklich gute Agenda <a href=\"https://flensburg-mitmachen.de/flensburg-2030\">Flensburg 2030</a>, das faschistische Großmachtsstreben des russischen Zaren, plus diverse andere Faktoren — all das spricht dafür, den eigenen Energieverbrauch zu überdenken.</p>\n<h2 id=\"die-großen-brocken-sind-schon-weg\">Die großen Brocken sind schon weg</h2>\n<p>Ja, mit den großen Baustellen auf diesem Feld haben wir uns schon befasst:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Wir haben uns vom Wohnraum her verkleinert, nicht zuletzt auch, weil ein Haus in der Größe unseres alten für 2-3 Personen komplett überdimensioniert war.  Die Umgewöhnung auf eine Wohnung war nicht allzu schwer, <a href=\"https://zottmann.org/2022/06/25/fresh-in-flensburg.html\">in Gesamtheit betrachtet</a>. 😉</li>\n<li>Wir fahren primär ÖPNV und nur noch sehr selten mit dem Auto. Flensburg ist übersichtlich und hilft dabei; die Öffis sind gut ausgebaut, und die Stadt ist sehr Fußgänger- und Bike-freundlich.</li>\n<li>Wir haben aus Überzeugung seit Jahren keine Flugreisen mehr gemacht, auch wenn wir Stockholm und Skandinavien schon hart vermisst haben.  Nur: wenn mir die Umwelt wichtig ist (und ich darum z.B. bei einem auf Umweltschutz begründeten Unternehmen (<a href=\"https://recup.de/\">☕️</a>) arbeite), dann kann ich schlecht für die Urlaubsreise in ein Flugzeug steigen (und innerhalb von ein paar Stunden meine gesamte gute Arbeit des letzten Jahres negieren). Ich weiss um CO₂-Kompensation für Flüge, und dass sie besser als <em>keine</em> CO₂-Kompensation ist, aber ich habe auch genug darüber gelesen, um zu verstehen, dass das Konzept zu 75% Greenwashing-Augenwischerei ist. <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>  (Das ist kein Diss an Menschen, die im Urlaub in die Ferne wollen — aber bitte seid realistisch, wie gut oder schlecht dieses System <em>wirklich</em> funktioniert, denn es ist faktisch kein Ausgleich.)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"es-bleibt-der-tägliche-verbrauch-in-den-eigenen-vier-wänden\">Es bleibt der tägliche Verbrauch in den eigenen vier Wänden</h2>\n<p>Zwei Fragen, die wir uns anschliessend also gestellt haben:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Was brauchen &amp; möchten wir an elektrischen Geräten?</li>\n<li>Was verbrauchen diese Geräte, und vor allen Dingen: wann?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Die erste Frage haben wir größtenteils schon im Rahmen des Umzuges und dem damit verbundenen Reduzieren von <em>Dingen</em> beantworten können (siehe <a href=\"https://zottmann.org/2022/05/07/fresh-in-flensburg.html\">Fresh in Flensburg #4: 12 Kisten</a>).  Die Liste unserer Geräte ist ziemlich geschrumpft, also habe ich mich mit Frage #2 befasst.</p>\n<p>Eins meiner Lieblingstools ist der Energiekosten-Monitor, der zwischen Steckdose und Gerät platziert wird und den Verbrauch des eingesteckten Gerätes misst. (Ich nutze hier einen einfachen REV Energiekosten-Monitor — die gibt&rsquo;s in jedem Baumarkt, z.B. für <a href=\"https://www.bauhaus.info/messgeraete/rev-energiekosten-messgeraet/p/22768904\">12€ bei Bauhaus</a>).  Er zeigt sowohl den aktuellen als auch den gesamten Verbrauch über den Messzeitraum auf, somit kann ich einfach erkennen, wieviel Energie z.B. der TV im Standby und/oder im Betrieb benötigt. Lehrreich.</p>\n<p>Über die letzten paar Tage habe ich also alle dauerhaft stromversorgten Geräte auf den Prüfstand gestellt.  Spoiler: das bisschen Standby hier und da ist in Summe nicht zu unterschätzen.</p>\n<h2 id=\"watt-kostet-die-welt\">Watt kostet die Welt</h2>\n<p>Ein Gerät, welches rund um die Uhr <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1 Watt (W)<!-- raw HTML omitted --> verbraucht, verbrennt im Jahr <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8,76 Kilowattstunden<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (kWh). Bei einem aktuellen/ angenommenen kWh-Preis von <!-- raw HTML omitted -->~0,57 €<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bedeutet das <!-- raw HTML omitted -->~5,00 €/Jahr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>Gute Faustformel für den Juli 2022: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1 W/h = 5 €/Jahr.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Sorry für die doofe Zwischenüberschrift.</p>\n<h2 id=\"konkrete-beispiele-und-rechnungen\">Konkrete Beispiele und Rechnungen</h2>\n<p>Auf meinem Schreibtisch stehen derzeit u.A. ein Laptop-Dock, ein 34&quot;-Monitor und ein Paar Lautsprecher (die ich wirklich selten benutze). Wenn der Laptop nicht angeschlossen ist, verbrauchen die Geräte im Standby-Modus zusammen ca. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6 W<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Die Standby-Zeit beträgt pro Tag durchschnittlich <!-- raw HTML omitted -->18 Stunden<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>6W = 30 €/Jahr = 52,56 kWh</li>\n<li>18 h sind 75% des Tages</li>\n<li>75% von 30 € = 22,50 € = 39,42 kWh</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ein zweites Beispiel: unsere FritzBox (der Router) läuft 24/7 und mümmelt dabei <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10 W/h<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, weil sie keinen Standby-Modus kennt. Das klingt erstmal nicht viel, aber:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10W = 50 €/Jahr = 87,60 kWh</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anders gesagt: der Betrieb dieses Gerätes kostet pro Monat <!-- raw HTML omitted -->~4,17 €<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>Beispiel #3: der FritzRepeater läuft ebenfalls rund um die Uhr und verbraucht <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3 W/h<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3W = 15 €/Jahr = 26,28 kWh</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mal abgesehen von den steigenden Kosten: hier verbrauchen Dinge <strong>sinnlos</strong> Energie.  Wenn ich nicht arbeite, müssen mein Dock, Monitor und Lautsprecher nicht in Bereitschaft auf mich warten.  Wenn wir schlafen, benötigen wir weder Router noch WLAN…</p>\n<p><strong>Wenn ich es nicht benutze, warum verschwende ich dann Energie dafür</strong>, und warum bezahle ich es?  Aus Gründen des Luxus‽  Fuck that noise.  <strong>Hier sehe ich meinen Beitrag zur Energiekrise.</strong>  (Mehr dazu gleich.)</p>\n<p>Das waren lediglich drei konkrete Beispiele aus unserem Haushalt.  In vielen anderen Wohnungen stehen auch Smart Speakers (Alexa/ Google Nest/ Apple), dicke Boxen, 55&quot;-TVs etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"einfach-mal-abschalten\">Einfach mal abschalten</h2>\n<p>Hier ist ein kleines, aber wichtiges Detail zu vielen Geräten: wenn es keinen mechanischen Schalter besitzt, um es an- und abzuschalten, wird die Stromzufuhr des Gerätes von einem elektronischen Bauteil gesteuert.</p>\n<p>Was funktioniert nicht ohne Strom?  Yep: Elektronik.  Touch-Panels und -Tasten?  Elektronik.  Fernbedienung?  Elektronik.  Das heisst, Geräte mit derlei Aktivierungen verbrauchen nie <em>keinen</em> Strom.</p>\n<p>Aus diesem Grund präferiere ich mechanisch-elektrische Lösungen, die den Stromfluss physisch ermöglichen oder unterbrechen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>schaltbare Zwischenstecker (<a href=\"https://www.bauhaus.info/innenstecker-innenkupplungen/unitec-zwischenstecker/p/12149378\">Beispiel</a>, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4-5 €<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</li>\n<li>Steckdosenleisten mit Schalter (<a href=\"https://www.bauhaus.info/mehrfachsteckdosen/steckdosenleiste/p/12157803\">Beispiel</a>, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3 €<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</li>\n<li>einzeln schaltbare Steckdosenleisten (<a href=\"https://www.brennenstuhl.com/de-DE/produkte/steckdosenleisten/steckdosenleiste-einzeln-schaltbar-6-fach-2m-h05vv-f-3g1-5-weiss\">Brennenstuhl</a>, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->27 €<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</li>\n<li>analoge Zeitschaltuhren (ich bevorzuge <a href=\"https://www.theben.de/de/theben-timer-26-0260030\">die Modelle von Theben</a>, solide und sehr still, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->15 €<!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"konkrete-ergebnisse\">Konkrete Ergebnisse</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Auf meinem Schreibtisch ist eine einzeln schaltbare Steckdosenleiste installiert.  Nach der Arbeit lege ich den Hauptschalter um, und alles ist abgeschaltet; während der Arbeit kann ich die Lautsprecher sowie andere selten benutzte Geräte wie den Scanner bei Bedarf zu- und abschalten.  <strong>Einsparung: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->39,4 kWh/Jahr<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></li>\n<li>Zwischen Fernseher und Steckdosen sitzt ein Zwischenschalter.  In den <!-- raw HTML omitted -->20 h<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pro Tag, an dem wir das Gerät nicht benötigen, zieht es auch keine Energie. <strong>Einsparung: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7,3 kWh<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></li>\n<li>Für den Router habe ich auf eine analoge Zeitschaltuhr zurückgegriffen. Zwischen <!-- raw HTML omitted -->01:00 Uhr<!-- raw HTML omitted --> und <!-- raw HTML omitted -->07:00 Uhr<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ist die FritzBox abgeschaltet — <strong>Einsparung: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->21,9 kWh/Jahr<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></li>\n<li>Beim Repeater greift das gleiche Konzept wie beim Router — <strong>Einsparung: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6,5 kWh/Jahr<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Summe dieser Beispiele: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->75,1 kWh/Jahr = 42,81 €/Jahr<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Nicht irre viel, aber auch nicht wenig!</p>\n<p>Die meisten Stromanbieter gehen bei einem 2-Personen-Haushalt von einem Verbrauch von <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2500 kWh<!-- raw HTML omitted --> aus.  Würden wir das tatsächlich verbrauchen, dann bedeuteten diese <!-- raw HTML omitted -->75 kWh<!-- raw HTML omitted --> eine Einsparung von 3%, und sie müssen nicht für uns produziert werden.</p>\n<p>Und die Geräte für die Reduktion (Schalter, Steckdosenleiste, Zeitschaltuhren) amortisieren sich spätestens im zweiten Jahr, selbst wenn wir total naiv davon ausgehen, dass die Strompreise nicht weiter steigen werden. Klingt nach einer guten Investition!</p>\n<h2 id=\"mein-beitrag-zur-energiekrise\">Mein Beitrag zur Energiekrise</h2>\n<p>Mein Beitrag ist das <em>bewusste</em> Verbrauchen von Energie.</p>\n<p>Ich kann meinen eigenen Verbrauch beeinflussen — zumindest teilweise.  Unsere Wohnung hat einen elektrisch betriebenen Durchlauferhitzer, ich kann also zwar die Menge an heissem Wasser beeinflussen, aber nicht, dass Wasser <em>auf diese Weise</em> erhitzt wird.  Der Kühlschrank war ebenfalls schon fest verbaut und hat möglicherweise nicht die Energieklasse, die ich mir gewünscht hätte.</p>\n<p>Lediglich die Geräte, die mir gehören, die ich betreibe, die kann ich steuern.  Zeitschaltuhren für 24/7-Geräte, mechanische Schalter für Standby-Geräte.</p>\n<p>Ja, jede:r von uns muss einen Beitrag leisten, denn <strong>dieser Standby-Energie-Luxus ist verdammtes 20.-Jahrhundert-Denken!</strong>  Basically: Stecker raus wenn nicht gebraucht!

				"content_text": "<p class=\"summary\" title=\"Zusammenfassung\">In diesem Blogpost zeige ich anhand von konkreten Beispielen auf, wie man recht einfach den Energieverbrauch im eigenen Heim senken und somit potentiell viel Stromkosten sparen kann. Let's go!</p>\n\nSeit wir im vor drei Monaten im April 2022 die Stadtwerke Flensburg als unseren Stromversorger ausgewählt haben, sind die Preise für die Kilowatt-Stunde um ~17% gestiegen.  Unser aktueller Preis ist für 12 Monate fixiert auf 50,07 ct/kWh, aber … you know.  Die neue Klimarealität, die wirklich gute Agenda [Flensburg 2030](https://flensburg-mitmachen.de/flensburg-2030), das faschistische Großmachtsstreben des russischen Zaren, plus diverse andere Faktoren — all das spricht dafür, den eigenen Energieverbrauch zu überdenken.\n\n\n## Die großen Brocken sind schon weg\n\nJa, mit den großen Baustellen auf diesem Feld haben wir uns schon befasst:\n\n1. Wir haben uns vom Wohnraum her verkleinert, nicht zuletzt auch, weil ein Haus in der Größe unseres alten für 2-3 Personen komplett überdimensioniert war.  Die Umgewöhnung auf eine Wohnung war nicht allzu schwer, [in Gesamtheit betrachtet](https://zottmann.org/2022/06/25/fresh-in-flensburg.html). 😉\n2. Wir fahren primär ÖPNV und nur noch sehr selten mit dem Auto. Flensburg ist übersichtlich und hilft dabei; die Öffis sind gut ausgebaut, und die Stadt ist sehr Fußgänger- und Bike-freundlich.\n3. Wir haben aus Überzeugung seit Jahren keine Flugreisen mehr gemacht, auch wenn wir Stockholm und Skandinavien schon hart vermisst haben.  Nur: wenn mir die Umwelt wichtig ist (und ich darum z.B. bei einem auf Umweltschutz begründeten Unternehmen ([☕️](https://recup.de/)) arbeite), dann kann ich schlecht für die Urlaubsreise in ein Flugzeug steigen (und innerhalb von ein paar Stunden meine gesamte gute Arbeit des letzten Jahres negieren). Ich weiss um CO₂-Kompensation für Flüge, und dass sie besser als *keine* CO₂-Kompensation ist, aber ich habe auch genug darüber gelesen, um zu verstehen, dass das Konzept zu 75% Greenwashing-Augenwischerei ist. [^1]  (Das ist kein Diss an Menschen, die im Urlaub in die Ferne wollen — aber bitte seid realistisch, wie gut oder schlecht dieses System *wirklich* funktioniert, denn es ist faktisch kein Ausgleich.)\n\n[^1]: Siehe [Flüge und Klima: Wie sinnvoll ist CO2-Kompensation von Flugreisen?](https://www.rnd.de/lifestyle/fluege-und-klima-wie-sinnvoll-ist-co2-kompensation-von-flugreisen-QFZISN36CJHTZE6K4H4E6VWHFE.html) beim RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland.\n\n\n## Es bleibt der tägliche Verbrauch in den eigenen vier Wänden\n\nZwei Fragen, die wir uns anschliessend also gestellt haben:\n\n1. Was brauchen & möchten wir an elektrischen Geräten?\n2. Was verbrauchen diese Geräte, und vor allen Dingen: wann?\n\nDie erste Frage haben wir größtenteils schon im Rahmen des Umzuges und dem damit verbundenen Reduzieren von *Dingen* beantworten können (siehe [Fresh in Flensburg #4: 12 Kisten](https://zottmann.org/2022/05/07/fresh-in-flensburg.html)).  Die Liste unserer Geräte ist ziemlich geschrumpft, also habe ich mich mit Frage #2 befasst.\n\nEins meiner Lieblingstools ist der Energiekosten-Monitor, der zwischen Steckdose und Gerät platziert wird und den Verbrauch des eingesteckten Gerätes misst. (Ich nutze hier einen einfachen REV Energiekosten-Monitor — die gibt's in jedem Baumarkt, z.B. für [12€ bei Bauhaus](https://www.bauhaus.info/messgeraete/rev-energiekosten-messgeraet/p/22768904)).  Er zeigt sowohl den aktuellen als auch den gesamten Verbrauch über den Messzeitraum auf, somit kann ich einfach erkennen, wieviel Energie z.B. der TV im Standby und/oder im Betrieb benötigt. Lehrreich.\n\nÜber die letzten paar Tage habe ich also alle dauerhaft stromversorgten Geräte auf den Prüfstand gestellt.  Spoiler: das bisschen Standby hier und da ist in Summe nicht zu unterschätzen.\n\n\n## Watt kostet die Welt\n\nEin Gerät, welches rund um die Uhr <nobr>1 Watt (W)</nobr> verbraucht, verbrennt im Jahr <nobr>8,76 Kilowattstunden</nobr> (kWh). Bei einem aktuellen/ angenommenen kWh-Preis von <nobr>~0,57 €</nobr> bedeutet das <nobr>~5,00 €/Jahr</nobr>.\n\nGute Faustformel für den Juli 2022: <nobr>1 W/h = 5 €/Jahr.</nobr>\n\nSorry für die doofe Zwischenüberschrift.\n\n\n## Konkrete Beispiele und Rechnungen\n\nAuf meinem Schreibtisch stehen derzeit u.A. ein Laptop-Dock, ein 34\"-Monitor und ein Paar Lautsprecher (die ich wirklich selten benutze). Wenn der Laptop nicht angeschlossen ist, verbrauchen die Geräte im Standby-Modus zusammen ca. <nobr>6 W</nobr>.  Die Standby-Zeit beträgt pro Tag durchschnittlich <nobr>18 Stunden</nobr>:\n\n- 6W = 30 €/Jahr = 52,56 kWh\n- 18 h sind 75% des Tages\n- 75% von 30 € = 22,50 € = 39,42 kWh\n\nEin zweites Beispiel: unsere FritzBox (der Router) läuft 24/7 und mümmelt dabei <nobr>10 W/h</nobr>, weil sie keinen Standby-Modus kennt. Das klingt erstmal nicht viel, aber:\n\n- 10W = 50 €/Jahr = 87,60 kWh\n\nAnders gesagt: der Betrieb dieses Gerätes kostet pro Monat <nobr>~4,17 €</nobr>.\n\nBeispiel #3: der FritzRepeater läuft ebenfalls rund um die Uhr und verbraucht <nobr>3 W/h</nobr>.\n\n- 3W = 15 €/Jahr = 26,28 kWh\n\nMal abgesehen von den steigenden Kosten: hier verbrauchen Dinge **sinnlos** Energie.  Wenn ich nicht arbeite, müssen mein Dock, Monitor und Lautsprecher nicht in Bereitschaft auf mich warten.  Wenn wir schlafen, benötigen wir weder Router noch WLAN…\n\n**Wenn ich es nicht benutze, warum verschwende ich dann Energie dafür**, und warum bezahle ich es?  Aus Gründen des Luxus‽  Fuck that noise.  **Hier sehe ich meinen Beitrag zur Energiekrise.**  (Mehr dazu gleich.)\n\nDas waren lediglich drei konkrete Beispiele aus unserem Haushalt.  In vielen anderen Wohnungen stehen auch Smart Speakers (Alexa/ Google Nest/ Apple), dicke Boxen, 55\"-TVs etc.\n\n\n## Einfach mal abschalten\n\nHier ist ein kleines, aber wichtiges Detail zu vielen Geräten: wenn es keinen mechanischen Schalter besitzt, um es an- und abzuschalten, wird die Stromzufuhr des Gerätes von einem elektronischen Bauteil gesteuert.\n\nWas funktioniert nicht ohne Strom?  Yep: Elektronik.  Touch-Panels und -Tasten?  Elektronik.  Fernbedienung?  Elektronik.  Das heisst, Geräte mit derlei Aktivierungen verbrauchen nie *keinen* Strom.\n\nAus diesem Grund präferiere ich mechanisch-elektrische Lösungen, die den Stromfluss physisch ermöglichen oder unterbrechen:\n\n- schaltbare Zwischenstecker ([Beispiel](https://www.bauhaus.info/innenstecker-innenkupplungen/unitec-zwischenstecker/p/12149378), <nobr>4-5 €</nobr>)\n- Steckdosenleisten mit Schalter ([Beispiel](https://www.bauhaus.info/mehrfachsteckdosen/steckdosenleiste/p/12157803), <nobr>3 €</nobr>)\n- einzeln schaltbare Steckdosenleisten ([Brennenstuhl](https://www.brennenstuhl.com/de-DE/produkte/steckdosenleisten/steckdosenleiste-einzeln-schaltbar-6-fach-2m-h05vv-f-3g1-5-weiss), <nobr>27 €</nobr>)\n- analoge Zeitschaltuhren (ich bevorzuge [die Modelle von Theben](https://www.theben.de/de/theben-timer-26-0260030), solide und sehr still, <nobr>15 €</nobr>)\n\n<figure class=\"fullwidth\">\n  <img \n    src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2022/8a370d8ecb.jpg\"\n    alt=\"Foto-Kollage: eingesteckter Energiekosten-Monitor in einer Steckdose; eingesteckter Zwischenschalter in einer Steckdose\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>\n      <strong>\n        Power Couple\n      </strong>\n      Links ein Energiekosten-Monitor, rechts ein Zwischenschalter\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n## Konkrete Ergebnisse\n\n- Auf meinem Schreibtisch ist eine einzeln schaltbare Steckdosenleiste installiert.  Nach der Arbeit lege ich den Hauptschalter um, und alles ist abgeschaltet; während der Arbeit kann ich die Lautsprecher sowie andere selten benutzte Geräte wie den Scanner bei Bedarf zu- und abschalten.  **Einsparung: <nobr>39,4 kWh/Jahr</nobr>**\n- Zwischen Fernseher und Steckdosen sitzt ein Zwischenschalter.  In den <nobr>20 h</nobr> pro Tag, an dem wir das Gerät nicht benötigen, zieht es auch keine Energie. **Einsparung: <nobr>7,3 kWh</nobr>**\n- Für den Router habe ich auf eine analoge Zeitschaltuhr zurückgegriffen. Zwischen <nobr>01:00 Uhr</nobr> und <nobr>07:00 Uhr</nobr> ist die FritzBox abgeschaltet — **Einsparung: <nobr>21,9 kWh/Jahr</nobr>**\n- Beim Repeater greift das gleiche Konzept wie beim Router — **Einsparung: <nobr>6,5 kWh/Jahr</nobr>**\n\nSumme dieser Beispiele: <nobr>75,1 kWh/Jahr = 42,81 €/Jahr</nobr>.  Nicht irre viel, aber auch nicht wenig!  \n\nDie meisten Stromanbieter gehen bei einem 2-Personen-Haushalt von einem Verbrauch von <nobr>2500 kWh</nobr> aus.  Würden wir das tatsächlich verbrauchen, dann bedeuteten diese <nobr>75 kWh</nobr> eine Einsparung von 3%, und sie müssen nicht für uns produziert werden.\n\nUnd die Geräte für die Reduktion (Schalter, Steckdosenleiste, Zeitschaltuhren) amortisieren sich spätestens im zweiten Jahr, selbst wenn wir total naiv davon ausgehen, dass die Strompreise nicht weiter steigen werden. Klingt nach einer guten Investition!\n\n\n## Mein Beitrag zur Energiekrise\n\nMein Beitrag ist das *bewusste* Verbrauchen von Energie.\n\nIch kann meinen eigenen Verbrauch beeinflussen — zumindest teilweise.  Unsere Wohnung hat einen elektrisch betriebenen Durchlauferhitzer, ich kann also zwar die Menge an heissem Wasser beeinflussen, aber nicht, dass Wasser *auf diese Weise* erhitzt wird.  Der Kühlschrank war ebenfalls schon fest verbaut und hat möglicherweise nicht die Energieklasse, die ich mir gewünscht hätte.\n\nLediglich die Geräte, die mir gehören, die ich betreibe, die kann ich steuern.  Zeitschaltuhren für 24/7-Geräte, mechanische Schalter für Standby-Geräte.  \n\nJa, jede:r von uns muss einen Beitrag leisten, denn **dieser Standby-Energie-Luxus ist verdammtes 20.-Jahrhundert-Denken!**  Basically: Stecker raus wenn nicht gebraucht!  Achte auf Deinen Verbrauch, wir dürfen unseren persönlichen Hedonismus nicht weiter über das Wohl der Gesellschaft stellen!  Alles richtig, meiner Meinung nach.\n\nABER.\n\nDie richtig großen Brocken sind nicht meine *persönliche* Aufgabe; wir sind Endverbraucher, wir können und müssen auch nicht alles abfangen, auch wenn uns die freie Wirtschaft diesen Eindruck sehr geschickt vermittelt hat.  Gesellschaft und Industrien müssen sich ändern, und damit meine ich nicht nur die Auto-, Mode-, Nahrungsmittel-, Flugreisen-, Metall- oder Fossilbrennstoffindustrien, sondern auch den \"Endless Growth\"-Shit im Technologie Sektor und die <abbr title=\"Not in my back yard\">NIMBY</abbr>-Kacke wie z.B. das *\"Windenergie? Gern, aber nicht hier, wo es total schön ist\"*-Denken in Süddeutschland.  (Das \"BY\" in \"NIMBY\" steht u.A. auch für \"Bayern\".)\n\nKurz gesagt: ohne mehr Zusammenhalt lokal und global, ohne mehr Nachhaltigkeit, ohne reales Besteuern von Externalitäten (Umweltverschmutzung, Menschenverschleiss) in der freien Wirtschaft wird es nicht gehen.\n\nLet's make it happen, all of it.  Fangt klein bei Euch daheim an, lasst uns ehrlich mit uns und unserer Umwelt sein, und darauf bestehen, dass für die nächsten Generationen nicht nur ein kleines Stück, sondern wieder ein ganzer Kuchen übrig ist.\n\n---\n\n## Abschliessender \"fun\" fact\n\nDas erste Amazon-Ergebnis für die Suchanfrage \"Samsung TV\" ist *Samsung Crystal UHD 4K TV 55 Zoll (GU55AU7179UXZG), HDR, Q-Symphony, Boundless screen [2021]* für <nobr>479 €</nobr>.  [Samsung's Produktseite](https://www.samsung.com/de/tvs/uhd-4k-tv/au7179-uhd-4k-smart-tv-2021-55-inch-gu55au7179uxzg/) beziffert den Stromverbrauch im Betrieb mit <nobr>101 W (SDR-Modus)</nobr> bis <nobr>130 W (HDR-Modus)</nobr>.\n\nNehmen wir mal an, dass Samsung bei diesen Angaben nicht lügt 😂, und dass dieser Fernseher <nobr>5 Stunden</nobr> pro Tag im Betrieb ist, dann verbraucht dieses Gerät bei einem 50:50-Mix dieser Bildmodi im Jahr <nobr>209,88 kWh</nobr> bzw. <nobr>119,63 €</nobr>.\n\nIch empfinde das als etwas absurd.\n",

				"content_text": "Ich erkunde meine Umgebung, wie ein Roomba-Staubsauger es tun würde.\n\nEs ist die gleiche chaotische Methodik: ich laufe in eine Richtung, bis ich auf eine Barriere stoße (ein Wald, eine Sackgasse, eine Autobahn, eine Wand, etc.), drehe mich etwas um die eigene Achse und gehe weiter. D rollt zwar hin und wieder mit den Augen (liebevoll und so), wenn wir auf einem unserer Spaziergänge feststellen, dass wir überraschenderweise im Kreis gelaufen sind, aber _\\*something something\\*_ Lernerfahrung.\n\nVor ein paar Tagen fand ich auf einem solchen mäandernden Streifzug eine etwas abgelegene Stelle zwischen [Mürwik](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCrwik) und [Sandwig](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwig).\n\n<figure class=\"fullwidth\">\n  <img \n    src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2022/d230dee6f4.jpg\"\n    alt=\"Eine dreiteilige Foto-Kollage: Füße im Wasser mit Blick Richtung Horizont; Blick über einen Kiesel-Strand (Wasser links, Waldkante rechts); Blick auf einen tunnelartigen Waldweg direkt am Wasser entlang\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>\n      <strong>\n        Happy places\n      </strong>\n      Holy fuck knuckles, are you serious right now\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nDas Wetter war nice, ich wollte mich bewegen, auch wenn ich erkältet war und mein Kopf nur auf gut 50% Leistung lief, und ich hatte schon einige Kilometer hinter mir. Ich hatte keine Termine, keinen Zeitdruck und keine Verpflichtungen; ich war nur etwas traurig, dass ich wegen der Erkältung das Barcamp im Technologiezentrum ausfallen lassen musste.  Ich setzte mich also auf die Steine, meine Füße im salzigen Wasser, die Sonne auf meinem beeindruckend vollen Haupthaar, [Kollund Østerskov](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kollund_%C3%98sterskov) in der Ferne, um mich herum nur Wald und Wasser und Stille, und ich tat … _nichts._ Ich war einfach nur ich <del>in der</del> als Teil der Natur. Und es war genug, großartig.\n\nNach ein paar Minuten tauchte dann plötzlich ein Gedanke auf, geboren aus tiefer Zufriedenheit mit diesem Augenblick: _\"Wenn ich jetzt der letzte Mensch auf der Erde wäre — das wäre auch okay, kein Stress deswegen.\"_  Genau da, an diesem Platz, in diesem Moment war einfach alles. total. in Balance.  Ich fühlte einen absoluten, erhebenden Gleichmut.\n\nGut, okay. Mir ist klar, dass das alles total nach _woo woo_ und performativem Zen-Bullshit klingt, und ich würde vermutlich auch abwinken, wenn mir jemand so etwas erzählt. Aber hier ist ein Geheimnis: so einen Platz hatte ich auch in München nie. Fantastische Momente mit den richtigen Leuten zur richtigen Zeit — klar, viele. Und ich 💛 München, immer noch. Aber ein Fleckchen Erde, welches solch intensiven Gefühle auslöst, das gab es nie dort, wo ich wohnte, auch nicht in Minga. Nichtsdestotrotz: schön war es in Bayern.  Nur meine _happy places_, die lagen bisher immer in der Ferne.\n\nBisher!\n\nUnd ja, es ist mir klar, dass im Moment die Sonne scheint und alles super ist, und irgendwann wahrscheinlich wieder Sturm und Regen und Schnee kommen und die Möwen uns das Leben zur Hölle machen werden und wir Ärger mit dem Vermieter haben usw. usf. Das weiss ich alles.

Am Montagmorgen um 7:30 Uhr standen die Männer vom Umzugsunternehmen auf der Matte, knapp vier Stunden später war all unsere Habe im LKW verstaut.  Nach der Wohnungsübergabe verabschiedeten wir uns von den Nachbarn, sprangen ins Auto und starteten nordwärts.  Die knapp 12 Stunden Fahrtzeit unterhielten wir uns mit, äh, sagen wir <em>&ldquo;vintage music&rdquo;</em> (Shoutout an <a href=\"https://www.80s80s.de/\">80s80s</a> und <a href=\"https://www.90s90s.de/radios/hiphop-rap\">90s90s Hiphop &amp; Rap</a> im Stream!).

Das neue Domizil ist sogar <em>noch</em> schöner mit uns darin, und nachdem die Möbel auch nicht mehr kreuz und quer im Weg stehen, ist es auch schon ziemlich wohnlich.  (Gut, es wäre noch noch gemütlicher, hätte ich mir nicht bei der Installation unserer massiven Miele-Waschmaschine das Kreuz verhoben, aber wenn das das einzige Problem bleibt, bin ich happy.)  Die wichtigsten Dinge sind geklärt: die Nachbarn scheinen nett zu sein; die neue Adresse steht in unseren Ausweisen; ich bin wieder selbständig; wir haben einen Stellplatz fürs Auto; wir kennen die Wege zum Recyclinghof, Baumarkt und Strand.  A propos:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Vier Worte dazu: &ldquo;1km bis zum Strand&rdquo;. <code>#happyAF</code>  Es gibt schlimmere Schicksale, finde ich!</p>\n<p>Noch ein positiver Effekt: dieser Umzug markierte den Abschluss einiger großer, lang andauernder Projekte und Themen; nun, da diese hinter uns liegen, schlafen D und ich spürbar besser und ruhiger als … naja, <em>als seit Jahren.</em>  Trotz gut befahrenen Bushaltestellen direkt vor dem Fenster!  Low-level stress, it&rsquo;s (been) a thing.</p>\n<p>Und wenn ich in den nächsten Tagen wieder fit bin und klar denken kann, und das Arbeitszimmer einsatzbereit ist, mache ich mir ein paar Gedanken zu meinen Plänen und den ersten Gigs.

Am Montagmorgen um 7:30 Uhr standen die Männer vom Umzugsunternehmen auf der Matte, knapp vier Stunden später war all unsere Habe im LKW verstaut.  Nach der Wohnungsübergabe verabschiedeten wir uns von den Nachbarn, sprangen ins Auto und starteten nordwärts.  Die knapp 12 Stunden Fahrtzeit unterhielten wir uns mit, äh, sagen wir _\"vintage music\"_ (Shoutout an [80s80s](https://www.80s80s.de/) und [90s90s Hiphop & Rap](https://www.90s90s.de/radios/hiphop-rap) im Stream!). Am Dienstagmittag war die Umzugscrew dann an der neuen Wohnung, und am späten Nachmittag war alles erledigt. Puh.\n\nUnd nun: **Flensburger Förde, Baby!** Da wären wir also.  Das neue Domizil ist sogar _noch_ schöner mit uns darin, und nachdem die Möbel auch nicht mehr kreuz und quer im Weg stehen, ist es auch schon ziemlich wohnlich.  (Gut, es wäre noch noch gemütlicher, hätte ich mir nicht bei der Installation unserer massiven Miele-Waschmaschine das Kreuz verhoben, aber wenn das das einzige Problem bleibt, bin ich happy.)  Die wichtigsten Dinge sind geklärt: die Nachbarn scheinen nett zu sein; die neue Adresse steht in unseren Ausweisen; ich bin wieder selbständig; wir haben einen Stellplatz fürs Auto; wir kennen die Wege zum Recyclinghof, Baumarkt und Strand.  A propos:\n\n<figure class=\"fullwidth\">\n  <img \n    src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2022/55b409498d.jpg\"\n    alt=\"Collage: Foto meiner Couch links, Strand rechts\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>\n      <strong>\n        #lifeGoals\n      </strong>\n      Zwischen diesen zwei Spots liegt ca. 1km.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nVier Worte dazu: \"1km bis zum Strand\". `#happyAF`  Es gibt schlimmere Schicksale, finde ich!\n\nNoch ein positiver Effekt: dieser Umzug markierte den Abschluss einiger großer, lang andauernder Projekte und Themen; nun, da diese hinter uns liegen, schlafen D und ich spürbar besser und ruhiger als … naja, _als seit Jahren._  Trotz gut befahrenen Bushaltestellen direkt vor dem Fenster!  Low-level stress, it's (been) a thing.\n\nUnd wenn ich in den nächsten Tagen wieder fit bin und klar denken kann, und das Arbeitszimmer einsatzbereit ist, mache ich mir ein paar Gedanken zu meinen Plänen und den ersten Gigs.  Es soll ja nicht langweilig werden.  `#neverStopNeverStopping`\n\n---\n\n*Dieser Post ist Teil [meines \"Fresh in Flensburg\"-Newsletters](https://flensburg.life).

				"content_text": "**Flensburg also.**\n\nDer Wunsch, irgendwann vielleicht einmal im Hohen Norden der Republik zu wohnen, in Nähe des Meers, den hatte D schon, als wir uns kennenlernten, glaube ich.  Jahreszahlen begannen damals mit \"1\", ich fuhr einen halbwegs neuen Golf II, und mangelnde Lebenserfahrung glichen wir mit diesem freshen Dreisatz aus Hotness, Blauäugigkeit und dynamischem Auftreten aus, den man nur mit Anfang 20 erfolgreich hinbekommt.\n\n<figure class=\"fullwidth\">\n  <img \n    src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/24102/2022/b591acf471.jpg\"\n    alt=\"Hafenspitze Flensburg\"\n  >\n  <figcaption>\n      <strong>\n        Hafenspitze Flensburg\n      </strong>\n      Die Hafenspitze wurde von der Flensburger Bürgerschaft im Jahr 1698 so benannt, weil sie den Hafen ziemlich spitze fand.  (Qualitätswitz!)\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nDie Küste lockte mit Urlaubserinnerungen: mit der *Gewissheit*, dass dort definitiv auf jeden Fall selbstverständlich immer die Sonne scheint; mit dem fest im Kopf verankerten Gefühl von Sand in Unterwäsche und unter den Füßen; mit den Flashbacks an diesen Moment als Teenager, in dem ich begriff, dass das Meer, auf das ich blickte, schon immer da war und in seiner Unermesslichkeit alles überdauern wird, resultierend in einem tiefen Gefühl von Ehrfurcht.  (Dass zwei dieser drei \"Wahrheiten\" lediglich darauf beruhten, dass ich immer nur in Sommermonaten dort war — geschenkt.)\n\nDie Ostsee war immer dieser Ort, den man im Urlaub sieht und geniesst, um dann den Rest des Jahres diesen zwei, drei Wochen nachzuschmachten und dem nächsten Trip entgegenzufiebern.  Diesen Status Quo ernsthaft zu hinterfragen, das war mir ein zu hoher emotionaler Aufwand.\n\nAusserdem: war ich nicht erst *vor Kurzem* nach München gezogen? (1998.)

				"content_text": "#### TL;DR\n\nI built a little helper tool named **Bearing** which allows for scripting Bear. It adds to Bear's own capabilites by slightly abstracting and enhancing the experience:\n\n1. There's a dedicated `bearing` CLI tool that accepts plain arguments.  No more `bear://…` calls, no more URL-encoding anything.\n2. The CLI tool returns callback responses as JSON.\n\n<https://github.com/carlo/bearing>\n\n\n#### Why?\n\nA few weeks back I switched from Evernote to [Bear](https://bear.app/).  I like Bear a lot (Markdown!) but its lack of Applescript support is irritating. Out of the box, Bear can be automated using [its x-callback-url API](https://bear.app/faq/X-callback-url%20Scheme%20documentation/), yes. But you don't get any return values for those calls in a simple way.\n\nI guess that's why all existing Bear-related scripts go H.A.M. on its SQLite DB. The [Bear FAQs say the following](https://bear.app/faq/Where%20are%20Bear's%20notes%20located/) about that:\n\n> For most users in most situations, we highly recommend not [to work with Bear's database]\n\nGreat. Also: understandable. That led to me setting out to build a simple wrapper app so I could work with Bear from command line and scripts in a easy and structured way without putting the notes database at risk.\n\n\n#### What can it do?\n\nExample: Creating a note\n\n```\n/usr/local/bin/bearing \\\n  create \\\n  --title=\"Bearing test note\" \\\n  --text=\"Works for me!\"\n```\n\n… returns …\n\n```\n{\n  \"title\": \"Bearing test note\",\n  \"identifier\": \"4963F8B4-3FE0-4835-B96D-7DCCB6101A62-1917-00013DC4BC4EE819\",\n  \"_success\": true\n}\n```\n\nSearching, tagging, editing etc are supported, as is everything else the x-callback-url API allows for. :)\n\n\n#### Dope, let's go\n\nMore information on usage, installation and whathaveyou can be found on Github:  \n<https://github.com/carlo/bearing>\n\n**It's still early days, and it definitely still has a few rough edges**, there are bugs.

The small robot — shaped like a miniaturized bulldozer with a CRT monitor for a cockpit — sits in a charging dock, waiting to be awoken. Like Pixar’s adorably anthropomorphic WALL-E, Cozmo falls somewhere between a Mars rover and an animated woodland creature. It’s lifelike enough to evoke sympathy, but still enough of a toy not to teeter too close to the uncanny valley._\n\n_With the tap of a smartphone screen, Cozmo comes to life. It makes a subtle motion to indicate it’s shaking off its slumber and begins wheeling over to the edge of the table. When it gets too close, it slams to a halt and looks down over the cliff, emitting a series of terrified chirps. When it wheels back and reorients itself, Cozmo takes a hard look at the other faces in the room. Some are new, but others it remembers from before it fell asleep._\n\nAnki Cozmo.

Ein Team der Universität Washington (USA) hat jetzt eine mechanische Hand entwickelt, die von einer künstlichen Intelligenz gesteuert wird. Diese hat sich selbst beigebracht, wie sie sich bewegen kann und muss, um bestimmte Aufgaben zu meistern.\n\n_This five-fingered robot hand developed by University of Washington computer science and engineering researchers can learn how to perform dexterous manipulation — like spinning a tube full of coffee beans — on its own, rather than having humans program its actions._\n\nDas kurze, eingebettete Video zeigt die Fähigkeiten der Hand sowie Ausschnitte aus dem Lernprozess.\n\n### [Australischer Roboter Hadrian mauert Haus in 48 Stunden](http://www.ingenieur.de/Branchen/Bauwirtschaft/Australischer-Roboter-Hadrian-mauert-Haus-in-48-Stunden)\n\ningenieur.de\n\nDie Meldung an sich ist schon ein knappes Jahr alt, aber ich wurde gerade erst darauf aufmerksam gemacht.  (Danke dafür, Leser [Eduard Anton](https://twitter.com/ede_/status/745749932884254720)!)\n\n_Ein Roboter namens Hadrian aus Australien mauert ein Familienhaus in nur zwei Tagen. Bauarbeiter brauchen bis zu sechs Wochen. Die Firma Fastbricks Robotics will damit günstigere Häuser ermöglichen._\n\n_Auf den ersten Blick sieht Hadrian wie eine gewöhnliche Baumaschine aus. Ist er aber nicht. Der Roboter trumpft mit einem Können auf, das in der Baubranche recht einzigartig ist. Er verbaut 1000 Steine pro Stunde und mauert ein Haus in nur zwei Tagen. Selbst die besten Bauarbeiter schaffen in Wettbewerben höchstens 743 Steine. \\[…\\]_\n\n_Und so funktioniert Hadrian: Der Roboter greift auf 3D-Baupläne zu, die Konstrukteure in der sogenannten Computer-Aided-Design-Software (CAD) hinterlegen. Er lernt die Position jedes Ziegels kennen. Dann nimmt er sie nacheinander mit einer Greifhand auf, kürzt sie bei Bedarf, lässt Mörtel darauf fließen und legt sie an die richtige Stelle._\n\nHadrian wird kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt, und Fastbricks Robotics arbeitet an der Markteinführung bis Mitte 2017.\n\nIch empfehle, [das kurze Demo-Video](https://youtu.be/4YcrO8ONcfY) anzuschauen: 2:07 min, (sehr wenige) englischsprachige Einblendungen.\n\n---\n\n## Zu guter Letzt…\n\n### [AI, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning: A Primer](https://vimeo.com/170189199)\n\nvimeo.com\n\nUnd wer einfache (englischsprachige) Erklärungen der Begriffe _\"artificial intelligence\"_, _\"machine learning\"_ und _\"deep learning\"_ sucht, dem sei dieses Video empfohlen.

Ich würde sie sofort probieren. Mahlzeit!\n\n_This summer, diners in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles will get their hands on a hamburger that has been five years in the making._\n\n_The burger looks, tastes and smells like beef — except it's made entirely from plants. It sizzles on the grill and even browns and oozes fat when it cooks. It's the brainchild of former Stanford biochemist Patrick Brown and his research team at Northern California-based Impossible Foods. \\[…\\]_\n\n_\"The demand for meat is going through the roof, and the world is not going to be able to satisfy that using animals — there's just not enough space, not enough water,\" says Brown, Impossible Foods' founder and CEO. \\[…\\]_\n\n_So Impossible Foods has developed a burger that it says is less resource-intensive, healthier and will eventually be cheaper to produce than red meat._\n\nFake-Fleisch-Patties für Impossible Foods' Burger, der Experten und Feinschmecker anscheinend vom Hocker haut.\n\n### [Neues aus der Zukunft – Die Good News von morgen schon heute lesen](http://blog.press-n-relations.de/pr-social-media-co/neues-aus-der-zukunft-die-good-news-von-morgen-schon-heute-lesen/)\n\nblog.press-n-relations.de\n\nThomas Seibold von press'n'relations hat mich für ihre Website interviewt.

The atom is trapped in a cone of electromagnetic energy and lasers are used to heat it up and cool it down, which causes the atom to move back and forth in the cone like an engine piston. \\[…\\]_\n\n_Here are four more tiny machines that could have a big impact._\n\n### [Stanford researchers ‘stunned’ by stem cell experiment that helped stroke patient walk](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/06/02/stanford-researchers-stunned-by-stem-cell-experiment-that-helped-stroke-patient-walk/)\n\nwashingtonpost.com\n\nAn der Stanford University School of Medicine wurde eine Studie beendet, in der Patienten, die nach einem Schlaganfall schwere motorische Störungen aufwiesen, Stammzellen ins Hirn gespritzt wurden. Das führte zu einer überraschenden Regeneration der beschädigten Hirnregionen, mit teils atemberaubenden Folgen: die Leute konnten Gliedmaßen wieder bewegen, die durch den Schlaganfall lahmgelegt worden waren, in einem Fall konnte eine 71-jährige Frau nach mehreren Jahren ihren Rollstuhl verlassen und wieder selbständig gehen.\n\n_Stanford researchers studying the effect of stem cells injected directly into the brains of stroke patients said Thursday that they were \"stunned\" by the extent to which the experimental treatment restored motor function in some of the patients. While the research involved only 18 patients and was designed primarily to look at the safety of such a procedure and not its effectiveness, it is creating significant buzz in the neuroscience community because the results appear to contradict a core belief about brain damage — that it is permanent and irreversible. \\[…\\]_\n\n_Gary Steinberg, the study's lead author and chair of neurosurgery at Stanford, said in an interview that while he is cautious about \"overselling\" the results of such a small study, his team has been \"stunned\" that seven of the 18 patients experienced significant improvement in their abilities following treatment._\n\n_\"Their recovery was not just a minimal recovery like someone who couldn't move a thumb now being able to wiggle it. It was much more meaningful. One 71-year-old wheelchair-bound patient was walking again,\" said Steinberg, who personally performed most of the surgeries._\n\n### [Die Allwetter-Solarzelle](http://www.heise.de/tr/artikel/Die-Allwetter-Solarzelle-3197636.html)\n\nheise.de\n\n_Ein Team \\[…\\] der Ocean University of China in Qingdao hat nun in Zusammenarbeit mit Kollegen an der Yunnan Normal University in Kunming eine Allwetter-Solarzelle entwickelt, die sowohl Lichtstrahlen als auch Regentropfen in Strom verwandeln kann.

Even mighty ExxonMobil saw its profit shrink by half in 2015 from the previous year.

Deswegen wird sich NadZ in Zukunft eher am Modell &ldquo;kuratierte Link-Sammlung&rdquo; orientieren: ich sammle die Artikel, die mich ansprechen, und bringe sie dann mit Link, kurzem Exzerpt und/oder ein bis zwei Sätzen auf Deutsch in den Newsletter.</p>\n<p>**#2:**<strong>NadZ wird definitiv etwas mehr &ldquo;makro&rdquo;.</strong> Technologische Fortschritte sind super, aber was wir mit ihnen anstellen bzw. wie sie unsere Gesellschaft verändern können (und werden), das ist mindestens ebenso wichtig wie die technische Entwicklung an sich.

Okay:\n\n**#1: Ich gehe ab sofort davon aus, dass Ihr (die tollsten Newsletter-Leser Deutschlands!) zumindest halbwegs gut Englisch sprecht.** Ich schaffe es schlichtweg nicht mehr, englischsprachige Artikel in deutsch zusammenzufassen.

Fallende Unfallzahlen werden gewissen Ängste bei Abschleppunternehmen und Anwälten auslösen. Wo keine Fahrer sind, sind weniger Raststätten vonnöten. Brauchen wir dann noch so viele Parkplätze wie bisher, und wenn nein, was heisst das für die Parkplatzbetreiber? Und so weiter.\n\nAutomatisierung und Roboter werden viele Jobs wegzaubern.

Quelle: Youtube, h2r Lab.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1GLNL2J\"><strong>Artikel im MIT Technology Review</strong></a> <a href=\"http://gt.zukun.tf/1GLNL2J\">«gtü»</a> — Forscher weltweit arbeiten an Systemen, die Robotern erlauben, erlerntes Wissen untereinander auszutauschen. Ein solches System ist <a href=\"http://www.robobrain.me/\">RoboBrain</a>.</p>\n<p>Vor Kurzem hat ein Roboter (Name/Typ: Baxter) via Robobrain die Daten eines komplett anderen Roboters (Name/Typ: PR2) genutzt, um zu verstehen, wie man Tassen auf andere Objekte stellt. Das klingt in erster Linie nach einer sinnlosen Aufgabe, ist aber durchaus komplex, schliesslich musste PR2 von seinem menschlichen Trainer erst diverse Konzepte erlernen, um zum Ziel zu kommen: welches dieser Objekte ist eine Tasse, wohin soll die eigentlich, und warum fällt sie dauernd wieder von diesem anderen Ding herunter — und was ist <em>das Ding</em> überhaupt? Und so weiter.</p>\n<p>Baxter übernahm dann schliesslich all dieses erlernte Wissen, und setzte es für sich selbst um, was bemerkenswert ist, schliesslich sind die zwei Maschinen durchaus unterschiedlich aufgebaut, simple Instruktionen können also nicht 1:1 übernommen werden.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Researchers at Cornell University previously devised an online game, called TellMeDave, through which volunteers can help train a robot to perform a task and associate different actions with commands given in everyday language. By guiding the robot through a task, a volunteer trains a machine-learning algorithm so the robot can perform the task again. And this learned behavior is stored in a central repository called RoboBrain that’s accessible by other robots […]</p>\n<p>Some time ago, through this platform, a type of research robot called PR2 had been taught to perform a number of a simple demonstration tasks, including picking up several mugs from a table and placing them on top of upturned bowls. Several hundred miles away, in a lab at Brown University, a different type of robot, called Baxter, has taken what PR2 had learned and used it to figure out how to perform the same task in a different setting.</p>\n<p>The work is part of an effort to figure out how robots might share information in useful ways. That could reduce the need for meticulous reprogramming, and it could allow robots to adapt to quickly when faced with a new task or an unfamiliar setting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Das ist natürlich nur ein kleiner Schritt, aber trotzdem bedeutend für die Robotik, und kein Endziel in sich. Wissen weiterzugeben ist schliesslich eine wichtige Fähigkeit. Eltern lehren ihre Kinder, z.B. wie man mit Messer und Gabel isst, wie man sein Zimmer aufräumt, dass Giesskanne und Steckdose nicht zusammengehören oder dass ein Feuerzeug ziemlich ungeeignet für die Haarpflege ist. Dadurch muss der Nachwuchs nicht alles Wissen selbständig erlangen, es wird ihm zugetragen, was seine Entwicklung beschleunigt. Das ist in der Robotik nicht so viel anders.</p>\n<p>Ich denke trotzdem, dass noch ein paar Jahre ins Land gehen werden, bis Robobrain eine eine eigene Kategorie für Erlerntes vom Typ “KILL HUMANS” hat. Hahaha.

Sie steuert das Tablet mit ihren Gedanken.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Two years ago, patient T6 volunteered for the BrainGate clinical trials and had a 100-channel electrode array implanted into the left side of her brain in regions responsible for movement.</p>\n<p>At the time, the Stanford subdivision was working on a prototype prosthetic device to help paralyzed patients type out words on a custom-designed keyboard by simply thinking about the words they want to spell.</p>\n<p>The prototype worked like this: the implanted electrodes recorded her brain activity as she looked to a target letter on the screen, passed it on to the neuroprosthesis, which then interpreted the signals and translated them into continuous control of cursor movements and clicks. […]</p>\n<p>The team’s breakthrough moment came when they realized their point-and-click cursor system was similar to finger tapping on a touchscreen, something most of us do everyday.

Ein genetisch verändertes Herpesvirus darf jetzt von Kliniken bei der Behandlung von bestimmten Arten von Hautkrebs eingesetzt werden. Das Virus infiziert die Tumorzellen, was das Immunsystem veranlasst, diese Zellen zu bekämpfen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An engineered herpesvirus that provokes an immune response against cancer has become the first treatment of its kind to be approved for use in the United States, paving the way for a long-awaited class of therapies. On 27 October, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a genetically engineered virus called talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) to treat advanced melanoma. Four days earlier, advisers to the European Medicines Agency had endorsed the drug.</p>\n<p>With dozens of ongoing clinical trials of similar ‘oncolytic’ viruses, researchers hope that the approval will generate the enthusiasm and cash needed to spur further development of the approach. <em>“The era of the oncolytic virus is probably here,”</em> says Stephen Russell, a cancer researcher and haematologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. <em>“I expect to see a great deal happening over the next few years.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Einen interessanten Artikel zur Meldung gibts auch bei <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1RUI1nM\">WIRED: <em>“The FDA Just Approved One Cancer-Killing Virus.

Quelle: Youtube, h2r Lab.\n\n[**Artikel im MIT Technology Review**](http://zukun.tf/1GLNL2J) [«gtü»](http://gt.zukun.tf/1GLNL2J) — Forscher weltweit arbeiten an Systemen, die Robotern erlauben, erlerntes Wissen untereinander auszutauschen. Ein solches System ist [RoboBrain](http://www.robobrain.me/).\n\nVor Kurzem hat ein Roboter (Name/Typ: Baxter) via Robobrain die Daten eines komplett anderen Roboters (Name/Typ: PR2) genutzt, um zu verstehen, wie man Tassen auf andere Objekte stellt. Das klingt in erster Linie nach einer sinnlosen Aufgabe, ist aber durchaus komplex, schliesslich musste PR2 von seinem menschlichen Trainer erst diverse Konzepte erlernen, um zum Ziel zu kommen: welches dieser Objekte ist eine Tasse, wohin soll die eigentlich, und warum fällt sie dauernd wieder von diesem anderen Ding herunter — und was ist _das Ding_ überhaupt? Und so weiter.\n\nBaxter übernahm dann schliesslich all dieses erlernte Wissen, und setzte es für sich selbst um, was bemerkenswert ist, schliesslich sind die zwei Maschinen durchaus unterschiedlich aufgebaut, simple Instruktionen können also nicht 1:1 übernommen werden.\n\n> Researchers at Cornell University previously devised an online game, called TellMeDave, through which volunteers can help train a robot to perform a task and associate different actions with commands given in everyday language. By guiding the robot through a task, a volunteer trains a machine-learning algorithm so the robot can perform the task again. And this learned behavior is stored in a central repository called RoboBrain that’s accessible by other robots \\[…\\]\n>\n> Some time ago, through this platform, a type of research robot called PR2 had been taught to perform a number of a simple demonstration tasks, including picking up several mugs from a table and placing them on top of upturned bowls. Several hundred miles away, in a lab at Brown University, a different type of robot, called Baxter, has taken what PR2 had learned and used it to figure out how to perform the same task in a different setting.\n>\n> The work is part of an effort to figure out how robots might share information in useful ways. That could reduce the need for meticulous reprogramming, and it could allow robots to adapt to quickly when faced with a new task or an unfamiliar setting.\n\nDas ist natürlich nur ein kleiner Schritt, aber trotzdem bedeutend für die Robotik, und kein Endziel in sich. Wissen weiterzugeben ist schliesslich eine wichtige Fähigkeit. Eltern lehren ihre Kinder, z.B. wie man mit Messer und Gabel isst, wie man sein Zimmer aufräumt, dass Giesskanne und Steckdose nicht zusammengehören oder dass ein Feuerzeug ziemlich ungeeignet für die Haarpflege ist. Dadurch muss der Nachwuchs nicht alles Wissen selbständig erlangen, es wird ihm zugetragen, was seine Entwicklung beschleunigt. Das ist in der Robotik nicht so viel anders.\n\nIch denke trotzdem, dass noch ein paar Jahre ins Land gehen werden, bis Robobrain eine eine eigene Kategorie für Erlerntes vom Typ “KILL HUMANS” hat. Hahaha. (Gott, Killer-Roboter-Witze sind so doof.)\n\n---\n\n## ALS-Patientin erhält Hirn-zu-Tablet-Interface\n\n[**Artikel beim Singularity HUB**](http://zukun.tf/1PdZwAm) [«gtü»](http://gt.zukun.tf/1PdZwAm) — Forscher an der Stanford University (USA) haben in Versuchen mit ALS-Patienten [^fussnote-als] ein Hirn/Tablet-Interface entwickelt, das es einer vollständig gelähmten Locked-in-Patientin erlaubt, per sog. “Neuroprothese” ein Android-Tablet zu bedienen. Sie steuert das Tablet mit ihren Gedanken.\n\n> Two years ago, patient T6 volunteered for the BrainGate clinical trials and had a 100-channel electrode array implanted into the left side of her brain in regions responsible for movement.\n>\n> At the time, the Stanford subdivision was working on a prototype prosthetic device to help paralyzed patients type out words on a custom-designed keyboard by simply thinking about the words they want to spell.\n>\n> The prototype worked like this: the implanted electrodes recorded her brain activity as she looked to a target letter on the screen, passed it on to the neuroprosthesis, which then interpreted the signals and translated them into continuous control of cursor movements and clicks. \\[…\\]\n>\n> The team’s breakthrough moment came when they realized their point-and-click cursor system was similar to finger tapping on a touchscreen, something most of us do everyday. \\[…\\]\n>\n> _“Basically the tablet recognized the prosthetic as a wireless Bluetooth mouse,”_ explained \\[Dr. Paul Nuyujukian, a neuroengineer and physician from Stanford University\\]. _“We pointed her to a web browser app and told her to have fun.”_\n\n[^fussnote-als]: _“Die Amyotrophe Lateralsklerose (ALS) ist eine nicht heilbare degenerative Erkrankung des motorischen Nervensystems. \\[…\\] Durch die Degeneration kommt es zur zunehmenden Muskelschwäche (Lähmung, Parese), die mit Muskelschwund (Amyotrophie) – durch Schädigung des zweiten Motoneurons – und mit einem erhöhten Muskeltonus (Spastik) – durch Schädigung des ersten Motoneurons – einhergeht.

Quelle: Dr. Andrejs Liepins/SPL\n\n[**Artikel in Nature**](http://zukun.tf/1l1Ge6d) [«gtü»](http://gt.zukun.tf/1l1Ge6d) — Die US-Regierungsbehörde FDA [^fussnote-fda] hat einer viralen Therapie gegen Melanoma die Zulassung erteilt. Ein genetisch verändertes Herpesvirus darf jetzt von Kliniken bei der Behandlung von bestimmten Arten von Hautkrebs eingesetzt werden. Das Virus infiziert die Tumorzellen, was das Immunsystem veranlasst, diese Zellen zu bekämpfen.\n\n> An engineered herpesvirus that provokes an immune response against cancer has become the first treatment of its kind to be approved for use in the United States, paving the way for a long-awaited class of therapies. On 27 October, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a genetically engineered virus called talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) to treat advanced melanoma. Four days earlier, advisers to the European Medicines Agency had endorsed the drug.\n>\n> With dozens of ongoing clinical trials of similar ‘oncolytic’ viruses, researchers hope that the approval will generate the enthusiasm and cash needed to spur further development of the approach. _“The era of the oncolytic virus is probably here,”_ says Stephen Russell, a cancer researcher and haematologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. _“I expect to see a great deal happening over the next few years.”_\n\nEinen interessanten Artikel zur Meldung gibts auch bei [WIRED: _“The FDA Just Approved One Cancer-Killing Virus. Expect More”_](http://zukun.tf/1RUI1nM) [«gtü»](http://gt.zukun.tf/1RUI1nM). Und ich denke, WIRED hat vollkommen recht, wenn sie die Therapie oberflächlich betrachtet als wenig aufregend bezeichnen, denn die Behandlung ist teuer (~$65.000) und gibt dem Patienten durchschnittlich “nur” ein paar Monate mehr.

Quelle: Boing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1QoQ2kf\"><strong>Artikel der International Business Times</strong></a> <a href=\"http://gt.zukun.tf/1QoQ2kf\">«gtü»</a> — Boing hat ein neues Mikrometallgitter-Material (“Microlattice”) vorgestellt, dass zu 99.9% aus Luft besteht. (Hauptsächlich besteht es aus winzigen querverbundenen hohlen Röhrchen, deren Wandungen ca. 1000⨉ dünner als ein menschliches Haar sind.)

Die Therapie soll es den Augen der Patienten, die an zunehmendem Verlust ihrer Sehfähigkeit bis hin zu völliger Blindheit leiden, ermöglichen, neue Photorezeptoren aufzubauen — und damit die geschädigten retinalen Zellen zu umgehen.</p>\n<p>Anders formuliert: RetroSense Therapeutics ist mit seiner Gentherapie anscheinend auf einem guten Weg, ein paar Arten von Blindheit zu umgehen.</p>\n<p>Das wissenschaftliche Feld, um das es hier geht, nennt sich Optogenetik — die Steuerung von genetisch modifizierten Zellen durch Licht. Vor ein paar Jahren kam die Forschung auf die Idee, sog. “Transportproteine” zu nutzen, die in grünen Algen vorkommen. Diese Proteine docken sich an Zellen an und öffnen diese, wenn sie mit Licht in Berührung kommen. Durch diese Öffnung gelangen Ionen in die Zellen, und dann … <em>passiert Wissenschaft!</em> Je nach Zelltyp geschehen unterschiedliche Dinge; die Auswirkung bei den Zelltypen in der Retina, die nicht durch RP zerstört werden, ist die Entwicklung einer Licht-Wahrnehmung und die Weitergabe dieser sensorischen Signale ans Hirn. Die Sehfähigkeit wird (teilweise) neu hergestellt.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It sounds completely crazy: as early as next year, using gene therapy scientists hope to restore sight in the blind by giving their eyes additional “light sensors.” […]</p>\n<p>In many eye disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa or macular degeneration, the rods and cones gradually die off. This leads to progressively failing vision, and — without a cure — eventually turns one out of four sufferers legally blind.</p>\n<p>These are cold, brutal diseases, but there is one silver lining: they leave ganglion and bipolar cells intact and still able to still communicate with the brain. […]</p>\n<p>In 2006, Dr. Zhou Hua Pan, a researcher at Wayne State University, decided to stick the protein [channelrhodopsin-2] into mice that were genetically engineered for photoreceptor degeneration. It worked on the first try; in less than three months after a single treatment, the mice passed every vision test the scientists could throw at them.</p>\n<p><em>“It worked perfectly, even in the very beginning,”</em> Pan told Wired. <em>“That was basically just really, really lucky.”</em></p>\n<p>Pan’s success did not escape the notice of the biotech industry. In 2009, RetroSense Therapeutics […] leased the eye-wiring tech from Pan in a bid to bring it to human trials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Die klinischen Tests sollen vor Jahresende beginnen.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"stanford-university-entwickelt-elektronen-kamera\">Stanford University entwickelt &ldquo;Elektronen-Kamera&rdquo;</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1LwSHZM\"><strong>Meldunge des SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</strong></a> <a href=\"http://gt.zukun.tf/1LwSHZM\">«gtü»</a> — Das Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in den USA hat eine neue “Elektronen-Kamera” entwickelt, mit der Aufnahmen von einzelnen Atomen in Bewegung gemacht wurden, während diese “Knitter” in einem Material erzeugten, das lediglich drei Atome dick war (sog.

Revealed by a brand new “electron camera,” one of the world’s speediest, this unprecedented level of detail could guide researchers in the development of efficient solar cells, fast and flexible electronics and high-performance chemical catalysts.</p>\n<p>The breakthrough […] could take materials science to a whole new level.

Die Therapie soll es den Augen der Patienten, die an zunehmendem Verlust ihrer Sehfähigkeit bis hin zu völliger Blindheit leiden, ermöglichen, neue Photorezeptoren aufzubauen — und damit die geschädigten retinalen Zellen zu umgehen.\n\nAnders formuliert: RetroSense Therapeutics ist mit seiner Gentherapie anscheinend auf einem guten Weg, ein paar Arten von Blindheit zu umgehen.\n\nDas wissenschaftliche Feld, um das es hier geht, nennt sich Optogenetik — die Steuerung von genetisch modifizierten Zellen durch Licht. Vor ein paar Jahren kam die Forschung auf die Idee, sog. “Transportproteine” zu nutzen, die in grünen Algen vorkommen. Diese Proteine docken sich an Zellen an und öffnen diese, wenn sie mit Licht in Berührung kommen. Durch diese Öffnung gelangen Ionen in die Zellen, und dann … _passiert Wissenschaft!_ Je nach Zelltyp geschehen unterschiedliche Dinge; die Auswirkung bei den Zelltypen in der Retina, die nicht durch RP zerstört werden, ist die Entwicklung einer Licht-Wahrnehmung und die Weitergabe dieser sensorischen Signale ans Hirn. Die Sehfähigkeit wird (teilweise) neu hergestellt.\n\n> It sounds completely crazy: as early as next year, using gene therapy scientists hope to restore sight in the blind by giving their eyes additional “light sensors.” \\[…\\]\n>\n> In many eye disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa or macular degeneration, the rods and cones gradually die off. This leads to progressively failing vision, and — without a cure — eventually turns one out of four sufferers legally blind.\n>\n> These are cold, brutal diseases, but there is one silver lining: they leave ganglion and bipolar cells intact and still able to still communicate with the brain. \\[…\\]\n>\n> In 2006, Dr. Zhou Hua Pan, a researcher at Wayne State University, decided to stick the protein \\[channelrhodopsin-2\\] into mice that were genetically engineered for photoreceptor degeneration. It worked on the first try; in less than three months after a single treatment, the mice passed every vision test the scientists could throw at them.\n>\n> _“It worked perfectly, even in the very beginning,”_ Pan told Wired. _“That was basically just really, really lucky.”_\n>\n> Pan’s success did not escape the notice of the biotech industry. In 2009, RetroSense Therapeutics \\[…\\] leased the eye-wiring tech from Pan in a bid to bring it to human trials.\n\nDie klinischen Tests sollen vor Jahresende beginnen.\n\n[^fussnote-fda]: _“Die amerikanische Food and Drug Administration (FDA, dt.

Zum Beispiel in der Form von Pillen, die vorn rein und hinten wieder raus kommen:\n\n> Medicine is already embracing miniaturization, and some technology now makes its way through the human body without any tether to the outside world. There are, for example, battery-powered gadgets about the size of a large vitamin pill that can snap images of the esophagus, intestine, and colon as they move along.\n>\n> And in 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave Proteus Digital Health, headquartered in Redwood City, Calif., the green light to market a much smaller swallowable technology: a single-square-millimeter silicon circuit that can be embedded inside a pharmaceutical pill.\n\nAndere Projekte haben Prototypen winziger “Greifer” entwickelt, die im Körper Biopsien vornehmen können.\n\n> At Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, David Gracias and his colleagues have developed microgrippers—star-shaped devices that can measure less than 500 micrometers from tip to tip. The grippers can be made of materials that respond to environmental factors such as temperature, pH, and even enzymes. A temperature-sensitive gripper’s arms will close when exposed to the body’s heat. If placed well, the arms will close around tissue, performing a miniature biopsy.\n>\n> Such grippers might provide a less invasive way to screen for colon cancer in patients who suffer from chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.\n\n---\n\n## Zu guter Letzt…\n\nWenn ich die neue NadZ-Ausgabe zusammenstelle, sehe ich oft Stories, die ich interessant finde, zu denen ich aber nichts schreiben möchte.

That’s possible because dying cancer cells also shed DNA into a person’s blood. Early on, the amount is vanishingly small—and obscured by the healthy DNA that also circulates. That makes it difficult to measure. But Lo says the objective is simple: an annual blood test that finds cancer while it’s curable.

[…] a relatively inexpensive, easy-to-use system controlled by an app that does all of the piloting and most of the mission planning itself. Packing a 3G or 4G SIM card, the drone stays connected to guidance software running in the cloud. The user simply has to tell the Matternet ONE where to go and the drone devises an appropriate route that avoids obstacles and restricted airspace. It can carry 2.2 pounds up to 12 miles on a single charge (charging stations placed along the route can extend that range). […]</p>\n<p>Matternet field tested its drone technology, proving that its aircraft can fly in bad weather and beyond the line of sight of its operators. It proved it was adept at retrieving medical samples and delivering medicine to places that are often inaccessible due to poor roads, bad weather or other issues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Mehr zu ONE findet man direkt bei <a href=\"http://mttr.net/\">Matternet</a>.)</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"zu-guter-letzt\">Zu guter Letzt…</h2>\n<p>Wenn ich die neue NadZ-Ausgabe zusammenstelle, sehe ich oft Stories, die ich interessant finde, zu denen ich aber nichts schreiben möchte.

Sie nennen sich _liquid biopsies_, und sie durchsuchen Blutproben nach kranker DNA.\n\n> Fast DNA-sequencing machines are leading to simple blood tests for cancer. \\[…\\]\n>\n> Today \\[Dr. Dennis Lo\\] is competing with labs around the world to repeat that scientific and commercial success by developing cancer screening tests based on a simple blood draw. That’s possible because dying cancer cells also shed DNA into a person’s blood. Early on, the amount is vanishingly small—and obscured by the healthy DNA that also circulates. That makes it difficult to measure. But Lo says the objective is simple: an annual blood test that finds cancer while it’s curable. \\[…\\]\n>\n> Building on the foundations put in place by doctors like Lo, commercial interest in liquid biopsies has recently started to explode. Eric Topol, a professor of genomics at the Scripps Research Institute, predicted this January that the technology, applied to cancer and other diseases, will become the “stethoscope for the next 200 years.”\n\n---\n\n## Matternet: The drone delivery startup that's actually delivering\n\n[**Artikel bei Fortune**](http://zukun.tf/1ChUCyn) — Und mal wieder ein Follow-Up, das mir am Herzen liegt. Im März 2014 schrieb ich über Matternet ( [Ausgabe #16, “Drohnen: es geht auch friedlich!”](http://zukun.tf/1ChUeA8)), ein Startup, das ein Drohnen-basiertes Liefernetz für Medikamente und leichte Güter zum Einsatz in unwegigen Gebieten entwickelt. Die Firma stand im letzten Jahr nicht still, und setzt gerade ein Pilotprogramm in der Schweiz um, in Zusammenarbeit mit der Schweizer Post und dem Logistikunternehmen Swiss WorldCargo.\n\nUnd auch ihr kommerzielles Angebot steht in den Startlöchern: Matternet ONE, eine autarke Drohne.\n\n> The startup also recently announced that it will release the first commercial version of its technology, a $5,000 transport drone called the Matternet ONE. \\[…\\] a relatively inexpensive, easy-to-use system controlled by an app that does all of the piloting and most of the mission planning itself. Packing a 3G or 4G SIM card, the drone stays connected to guidance software running in the cloud. The user simply has to tell the Matternet ONE where to go and the drone devises an appropriate route that avoids obstacles and restricted airspace. It can carry 2.2 pounds up to 12 miles on a single charge (charging stations placed along the route can extend that range). \\[…\\]\n>\n> Matternet field tested its drone technology, proving that its aircraft can fly in bad weather and beyond the line of sight of its operators. It proved it was adept at retrieving medical samples and delivering medicine to places that are often inaccessible due to poor roads, bad weather or other issues.\n\n(Mehr zu ONE findet man direkt bei [Matternet](http://mttr.net/).)\n\n---\n\n## Zu guter Letzt…\n\nWenn ich die neue NadZ-Ausgabe zusammenstelle, sehe ich oft Stories, die ich interessant finde, zu denen ich aber nichts schreiben möchte. Zum Beispiel diese hier:\n\n- [The Top 30 Science Stories of 2015](http://zukun.tf/1JSdILD): gute Liste, definitiv nicht vollständig, aber ein netter “Whoa!”-Refresher.\n- Neulich: [LightSail Spacecraft Sends Back a Selfie Showing Its Sail Stretched Out](http://zukun.tf/1JSbE6u) Tolles Projekt! Hab ich auf Kickstarter unterstützt.\n- [Die perfekte Verhütung für den Mann ist da—warum nutzen wir sie nicht?](http://zukun.tf/1fl6hTf) Ich warte auch darauf. (Siehe auch Ausgabe #26, [“Die Zukunft der Verhütung”](http://zukun.tf/1Rl9N0K).)\n- Kein Zweifel, die Arbeitswelt verändert sich radikal: [Niederlande verankern das Recht auf Homeoffice im Gesetz](http://zukun.tf/1JRbNqH)\n\nSolche Kurzlinks poste ich täglich [auf Twitter (@municode#nadz)](http://zukun.tf/1JSfLzj) und gleichzeitig natürlich auch [auf Facebook](http://zukun.tf/1Rl9Nhh).

Previous similar systems have relied on bulky solar panels to provide renewable electricity \\[…\\] In this case, semiconducting nanowires capture energy from sunlight and pass electrons to electrotrophic bacteria, which are nestled within the wires. The electrotrophs use the electrons to turn carbon dioxide and water into useful chemical building blocks.\n\n---\n\n## Blueprint for a Better Human Body\n\n[**Artikel in The Atlantic**](http://zukun.tf/1HeOOb2) — Und hier noch ein abschliessender Lesetipp fürs Wochenende. Da gehts um ein Thema, das mich persönlich sehr fasziniert und das sich auch [in meinen Ansichten zur Evolution](http://zukun.tf/1NirdW8) wiederfindet.\n\n> More and more amputees, engineers, and prospective cyborgs are rejecting the idea that the “average” human body is a necessary blueprint for their devices. _“We have this strong picture of us as human beings with two legs, two hands, and one head in the middle,”_ says Stefan Greiner, the founder of Cyborgs eV, a Berlin-based group of body hackers. _“But there’s actually no reason that the human body has to look like as it has looked like for thousands of years.”_ \\[…\\]\n>\n> What was once an industry bent on replicating the human body exactly, the world of prosthetics has started thinking more creatively about what the human body can be. As technology advances, as engineers start to borrow ideas and designs not just from human biology but from elsewhere, and as prosthetics become less stigmatized, there are all sorts of options opening up. The human body, and what people consider the “normal” human body, can be a whole lot more than what’s biologically possible.\n",

Ein paar Monate später zeigten sie auf der Entwicklerkonferenz Build 2015 eine Live-Demo, in der sie das Gerät mehr oder weniger vorn auf eine Kamera schnallten. Das Resultat ist [ein recht beeindruckendes Video](https://youtu.be/hglZb5CWzNQ).\n\nNatürlich darf man nicht vergessen, dass es eine von MS kontrollierte Demonstration war. Zwar war sich die Fachpresse nach eigenen Vor-Ort-Tests sicher, es hier mit einem _game changer_ zu tun zu haben, trotzdem gab es auch einige _“Saucool, aber…”_-Reaktionen. Die Technologie-Site [The Verge fasste den aktuellen Stand von HoloLens z.B. so zusammen](http://zukun.tf/1cGYv3M):\n\n> But HoloLens only feels natural when you’re not handling anything much bigger than a basketball. It produces a magic square the size of a large TV screen, and the moment something slips outside, it disappears. It’s possible to imagine that a small object has just dipped out of sight, but for a larger one, you either have to step quite a ways back or content yourself with just seeing pieces of it in the center of your vision. It shatters the illusion, and it looks very little like the amazing whole-world illusions of Microsoft’s videos.\n\nIch glaube nichtsdestotrotz, dass Microsoft da in eine sehr vielversprechende Richtung marschiert.\n\n[^fussnote-ar]: “Augmented Reality”, übersetzt “erweiterte Realität”, _“die computergestützte Erweiterung der Realitätswahrnehmung”_.

Dreissig! Hot damn. Bloss nicht nachlassen, oh Gott! Also habe ich ein paar gute Themen zusammengetragen in den letzten zwei Monaten. Diesmal gehts u.A. um die Marktzulassung des ersten Exoskeletts für Querschnittgelähmte, die mich tatsächlich glauben lässt, dass derlei Geräte schon in wenigen Jahren vielen Menschen aus ihrem Rollstuhl helfen werden. Und um Trinkwasser, und die Hoffnung, dass weltweite Knappheit in Zukunft vermieden werden kann. Und darum, dass das Leben in der Tat immer schneller wird, und wir uns das nicht einbilden.

Seit Anfang 2015 gilt in der EU eine neue Regelung für digitale Käufe (u.A.), die es für mich komplett unrentabel macht, Patreon zu benutzen. Aus diesem Grund habe ich alle bestehenden Pledges dankend von meiner Seite aus aufgelöst — der Aufwand, den ich betreiben müsste, um Patreon weiter zu nutzen, stünde in keinem Verhältnis zum Nutzen. Die Site macht sichs da einfach; das kann ich teilweise nachvollziehen, aber es hilft mir nicht weiter. Tja.

Der Clou dabei: das Gerät kostet $34; die Ausgaben für die Probenbehälter, die die zu testenden Blutstropfen “verarbeiten”, bewegen sich im Cent-Bereich. In Ruanda wurde das Gerät jetzt erstmalig in einem Feldversuch mit 96 Schwangeren eingesetzt.</p>\n<p>Und so funktionierts: dem Patienten wird an der Fingerspitze etwas Blut entnommen. Das Gerät mischt dann diese Tropfen in ihrem Probenbehälter mit Reagenzien: enthaltene Gold-Nanopartikel spüren eventuell vorhandene Antikörper auf, binden sich an sie, Silver-Nanopartikel reagieren dann mit den Gold-Nanopartikeln, und nach 15 min ist die Analyse komplett und wird im Smartphone gespeichert.</p>\n<p>Bis jetzt konnten solche Tests nur im Labor von Spezialisten auf Geräten durchgeführt werden, die mehrere Tausend Euro kosten. Das Smartphone-Addon ist günstiger, nur so groß wie ein iPhone, und das Training für das medizinische Personal benötigt, um die Bedienung zu erlernen, nimmt eine halbe Stunde in Anspruch.</p>\n<h3 id=\"links-zum-thema\">Links zum Thema</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Presse-Mitteilung der <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1zxb0UQ\">Columbia University: <em>Smartphone, Finger Prick, 15 Minutes, Diagnosis—Done!</em></a></li>\n<li>Artikel beim <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1zxb0nT\">MIT Technology Review: <em>A Smartphone Test for HIV and Syphilis Shows Promise in Rwanda</em></a></li>\n<li>Artikel bei <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1zxb07o\">Singularity HUB: <em>$34 Handheld Smartphone Device Diagnoses HIV and Syphilis in a Flash</em></a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"laser-sensor-für-hirntumorzellen\">Laser-Sensor für Hirntumorzellen</h2>\n<p>Wissenschaftler aus Kanada haben ein handliches optisches Messgerät entwickelt, das Hirnkrebszellen erkennen kann.

Damit liefert sie genug Frischwasser für rund 20% der Haushalte im Land, und zeigt, dass Desalination in einem so irre großen Maßstab machbar ist.</p>\n<p>Vor 10 Jahren war Israel noch komplett auf Regen- und Grundwasser angewiesen. Mittlerweile beherbergt das Land vier Seewasser-Entsalzungsanlagen, die zusammen 40% des Wasserbedarfs decken.

Dank technologischer und materialtechnischer Neuentwicklungen kann Sorek im laufenden Betrieb 1.000 Liter Trinkwasser für ~€0,35 erzeugen, was ich ziemlich beeindruckend finde. Das Wasser verkauft der Betreiber dann für ~€0,51 weiter, z.B. an die staatlichen Wasserwirtschaft.</p>\n<p>Und die Entwicklung bleibt nicht stehen: Lockheed Martin und einige andere Spieler arbeiten an Desalinatoren auf Graphen-Basis.

So behandelte Metallteile werden bis zu 10× stärker und reissfester, und viel unempfindlicher gegenüber Korrosion.</p>\n<p>Ein Stahlteil wird dabei in einen Tank mit einer Flüssigkeit getaucht, die diverse Metallionen enthält. Auf das Teil werden dann nacheinander unterschiedliche elektrische Spannungen gelegt; jede dieser Spannungen bringt eine Art Metallionen dazu, sich an den Stahl zu heften. Nach und nach entstehen dann mehrere Schichten, die auf Nano-Ebene miteinander agieren, und dem Stahlteil nachträglich zusätzliche Eigenschaften verleihen.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>Modumetal’s Prozess ist vor Kurzem dem Prototypen-Stadium entwachsen, und derart nano-laminierte Teile werden jetzt auf diversen Ölfeldern in den USA getestet. Dort wird teilweise mit hochaggressiven Chemikalien hantiert, was besondere Anforderungen an die Stahlteile stellt. Sollten sie sich beweisen können, wäre das ein großer Erfolg für die Firma, denn obwohl diese Technologie schon länger bekannt ist, war sie doch bis jetzt immer nur etwas fürs Labor. Modumetal hat es geschafft, sie in eine für die Industrie interessanten Größenordnung zu transformieren.</p>\n<p>Und rein theoretisch heisst das ja auch, dass man, würde diese Technik überall zur Anwendung kommen, auch weit weniger Rohmaterial bräuchte.

				"content_text": "Donnerstagmorgen sind dafür da, um sich zu auf den Frühstückssmoothie zu freuen. Bis die echten Anti-Aging-Pillen auf den Markt kommen, werden noch ein paar Jahre vergehen, und bis dahin muss ich unbedingt gesund bleiben…\n\nDie erste Ausgabe in diesem Jahr ist —zu meiner eigenen Überraschung!— tatsächlich schon die #30. Dreissig! Hot damn. Bloss nicht nachlassen, oh Gott! Also habe ich ein paar gute Themen zusammengetragen in den letzten zwei Monaten. Diesmal gehts u.A. um die Marktzulassung des ersten Exoskeletts für Querschnittgelähmte, die mich tatsächlich glauben lässt, dass derlei Geräte schon in wenigen Jahren vielen Menschen aus ihrem Rollstuhl helfen werden. Und um Trinkwasser, und die Hoffnung, dass weltweite Knappheit in Zukunft vermieden werden kann. Und darum, dass das Leben in der Tat immer schneller wird, und wir uns das nicht einbilden. Hurra!\n\nUnd, was nicht ganz so toll ist, es gibt schlechte Nachrichten für die Unterstützung via [Patreon](http://patreon.com). Seit Anfang 2015 gilt in der EU eine neue Regelung für digitale Käufe (u.A.), die es für mich komplett unrentabel macht, Patreon zu benutzen. Aus diesem Grund habe ich alle bestehenden Pledges dankend von meiner Seite aus aufgelöst — der Aufwand, den ich betreiben müsste, um Patreon weiter zu nutzen, stünde in keinem Verhältnis zum Nutzen. Die Site macht sichs da einfach; das kann ich teilweise nachvollziehen, aber es hilft mir nicht weiter. Tja. Wer mehr zu diesem ungemein erheiternden Thema wissen möchte, sollte nach _“Umsatzsteuer EU Mini-One-Stop-Shop”_ googlen. Yay.\n\nBis zur nächsten Ausgabe,\n\n— [Carlo](mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de).\n\n---\n\n## HIV- und Syphilis-Tests mit dem Smartphone\n\nDie University of Columbia hat ein Smartphone-Addon entwickelt, das schnell und zuverlässig HIV- und Syphilis-Antikörper in winzigen Blutproben erkennt. Der Clou dabei: das Gerät kostet $34; die Ausgaben für die Probenbehälter, die die zu testenden Blutstropfen “verarbeiten”, bewegen sich im Cent-Bereich. In Ruanda wurde das Gerät jetzt erstmalig in einem Feldversuch mit 96 Schwangeren eingesetzt.\n\nUnd so funktionierts: dem Patienten wird an der Fingerspitze etwas Blut entnommen. Das Gerät mischt dann diese Tropfen in ihrem Probenbehälter mit Reagenzien: enthaltene Gold-Nanopartikel spüren eventuell vorhandene Antikörper auf, binden sich an sie, Silver-Nanopartikel reagieren dann mit den Gold-Nanopartikeln, und nach 15 min ist die Analyse komplett und wird im Smartphone gespeichert.\n\nBis jetzt konnten solche Tests nur im Labor von Spezialisten auf Geräten durchgeführt werden, die mehrere Tausend Euro kosten. Das Smartphone-Addon ist günstiger, nur so groß wie ein iPhone, und das Training für das medizinische Personal benötigt, um die Bedienung zu erlernen, nimmt eine halbe Stunde in Anspruch.\n\n### Links zum Thema\n\n- Presse-Mitteilung der [Columbia University: _Smartphone, Finger Prick, 15 Minutes, Diagnosis—Done!_](http://zukun.tf/1zxb0UQ)\n- Artikel beim [MIT Technology Review: _A Smartphone Test for HIV and Syphilis Shows Promise in Rwanda_](http://zukun.tf/1zxb0nT)\n- Artikel bei [Singularity HUB: _$34 Handheld Smartphone Device Diagnoses HIV and Syphilis in a Flash_](http://zukun.tf/1zxb07o)\n\n---\n\n## Laser-Sensor für Hirntumorzellen\n\nWissenschaftler aus Kanada haben ein handliches optisches Messgerät entwickelt, das Hirnkrebszellen erkennen kann. Der bleistiftgroße Sensor identifiziert mittels Laserstrahlen krebsartige Zellen, und erlaubt es Chirurgen, während einer Operation schnell und non-destruktiv zu testen, ob Gewebe gesund ist oder Teil eines Tumors. (Der Sensor an sich ist handlich, aber ein dünnes Kabel verbindet ihn mit einer größeren Haupteinheit.)\n\nHerkömmliche Technologie wie z.B. Magnetresonanztomographie erkennt nach Angabe der kanadischen Mediziner zwar größere Tumore, aber Krebszellen, die sich in der Peripherie eines Tumors entwickelt haben, fallen oft durchs Raster. Ihr neuer Sensor ist dafür gemacht, solche Zellen während eines Eingriffs zu erkennen, damit sie entfernt werden können, was die Remissionrate des Patienten erhöhen dürfte.\n\n### Links zum Thema\n\n- Presse-Mitteilung der [McGill University: _Revolutionary new probe zooms in on cancer cells_](http://zukun.tf/1Ej3WRj)\n- Artikel bei [Med Device Online: _New Raman Spectroscopy Probe Could Improve Outcomes In Brain Cancer Surgery_](http://zukun.tf/1zxaXs5)\n- Artikel bei [KurzweilAI: _New laser probe identifies brain cancer cells in real time_](http://zukun.tf/1Ej0dmL)\n\n---\n\n## Wasser ins Töpfchen, Salz ins Kröpfchen\n\nDie weltgrößte Meerwasserentsalzunganlage, die auf Umkehrosmose-Basis arbeitet, steht in Sorek, Israel. Sie ist seit 2013 im Betrieb, wird aber erst jetzt auf volle Last hochgefahren: auf 627.000.000 Liter pro Tag (627.000 m³). Damit liefert sie genug Frischwasser für rund 20% der Haushalte im Land, und zeigt, dass Desalination in einem so irre großen Maßstab machbar ist.\n\nVor 10 Jahren war Israel noch komplett auf Regen- und Grundwasser angewiesen. Mittlerweile beherbergt das Land vier Seewasser-Entsalzungsanlagen, die zusammen 40% des Wasserbedarfs decken. Weitere Einrichtungen sind in Arbeit, und schon 2016 sollen es dann mehr als 50% sein.\n\nDie Anlage in Sorek überwindet einige Hürden, die den Prozess der Umkehrosmose immer etwas unwirtschaftlich gemacht haben, wie z.B. den hohen Energieaufwand. Dank technologischer und materialtechnischer Neuentwicklungen kann Sorek im laufenden Betrieb 1.000 Liter Trinkwasser für ~€0,35 erzeugen, was ich ziemlich beeindruckend finde. Das Wasser verkauft der Betreiber dann für ~€0,51 weiter, z.B. an die staatlichen Wasserwirtschaft.\n\nUnd die Entwicklung bleibt nicht stehen: Lockheed Martin und einige andere Spieler arbeiten an Desalinatoren auf Graphen-Basis. Hauchdünne Filter des Materials, nur 1 Atom dick, durch die Wasser hindurchfliesst, das enthaltene Salz aber hängenbleibt.

ReWalk ist ein robotisches Exoskelett, das querschnittgelähmten Personen das Gehen ermöglicht. Der Träger schnallt sich dabei in eine Art motorisiertes Gestell (das Exoskelett), das den Prozess der Bewegung übernimmt.\n\nReWalk’s computergesteuertes Kontrollsystem, das sich in einer Art Rucksack versteckt, steuert die Bewegungseinheit, die drei Modi beherrscht: Stehen, Sitzen und Gehen. Die Motoren an den Gelenken werden durch Akkus mit Strom versorgt, eine kabellose Fernbedienung am Handgelenk des Trägers schaltet zwischen den Modi um. Krücken sind für die Stabilisierung beim Gehen nötig.\n\nAlles in allem sehr, sehr beeindruckend und anscheinend lebensverändernd (Link zu einem deutschsprachigen Video-Erfahrungsbericht weiter unten). Aktuell ist das System mit ca. €61.000 (~$70.000) noch nicht wirklich günstig, aber auf dem Feld passiert gerade Einiges (siehe NadZ #27 zum “Soft Exosuit”) — ich denke, die Preise werden in den nächsten paar Jahre deutlich fallen, während die Auswahl an solchen Geräten steigt.\n\n### Links zum Thema\n\n- Pressemitteilung: [_ReWalk™ Personal Exoskeleton System Cleared by FDA for Home Use_](http://zukun.tf/1BM193i)\n- Produktseite: [_ReWalk™ – persönliche Nutzung_](http://zukun.tf/1w6IgAO)\n- [Deutschsprachiger Erfahrungsbericht bei Youtube](http://youtu.be/FS5tIuQCXAQ), 3:36 min (saugut!)\n- Artikel bei [Mashable: _FDA Approves First Robotic Exoskeleton for Paralyzed Users_](http://zukun.tf/1w6Ijwz)\n- Artikel bei [Slate: _ReWalk exoskeleton approved by FDA.

So behandelte Metallteile werden bis zu 10× stärker und reissfester, und viel unempfindlicher gegenüber Korrosion.\n\nEin Stahlteil wird dabei in einen Tank mit einer Flüssigkeit getaucht, die diverse Metallionen enthält. Auf das Teil werden dann nacheinander unterschiedliche elektrische Spannungen gelegt; jede dieser Spannungen bringt eine Art Metallionen dazu, sich an den Stahl zu heften. Nach und nach entstehen dann mehrere Schichten, die auf Nano-Ebene miteinander agieren, und dem Stahlteil nachträglich zusätzliche Eigenschaften verleihen.[^fussnote-nanoeigenschaften]\n\nModumetal’s Prozess ist vor Kurzem dem Prototypen-Stadium entwachsen, und derart nano-laminierte Teile werden jetzt auf diversen Ölfeldern in den USA getestet. Dort wird teilweise mit hochaggressiven Chemikalien hantiert, was besondere Anforderungen an die Stahlteile stellt. Sollten sie sich beweisen können, wäre das ein großer Erfolg für die Firma, denn obwohl diese Technologie schon länger bekannt ist, war sie doch bis jetzt immer nur etwas fürs Labor. Modumetal hat es geschafft, sie in eine für die Industrie interessanten Größenordnung zu transformieren.\n\nUnd rein theoretisch heisst das ja auch, dass man, würde diese Technik überall zur Anwendung kommen, auch weit weniger Rohmaterial bräuchte. Das kann nicht schlecht sein, oder?\n\n### Links zum Thema\n\n- [MODUMETAL website](http://www.modumetal.com/)\n- Artikel beim [MIT Technology Review: _Nano-Coated Steel Is 10 Times Stronger_](http://zukun.tf/1FtsncE)\n\n[^fussnote-nanoeigenschaften]: Röntgenblick, Schwerelosigkeit, tolle Brüste, volles Haar etc. Äh, ich meine: erhöhte Rostbeständigkeit, bessere Reissfestigkeit usw.\n\n\n---\n\n## Last but not least\n\n[**MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2015**](http://zukun.tf/1EsFixv) — Das MIT Tech Review hat ihre jährliche Liste von “Durchbrüchen” zusammengestellt: Entwicklungen, die zwar unter dem Radar der Massenmedien durchgeflogen sind, aber so grundlegend Neues hervorgebracht haben, dass sie ganze Industriezweige und Lebensbereiche umkrempeln können (und sehr vermutlich auch werden).

In Deutschland! Seit Anfang November ist das Mittel namens Glybera erhältlich, das die <em>sehr</em> seltene, erbliche Stoffwechselkrankheit Lipoproteinlipase-Defizienz heilt.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Bei LPLD-Betroffenen sammelt sich mit der Nahrung eingenommenes Fett im Blut, was oft zu lebensgefährlichen, wiederholten Entzündungen der Bauchspeicheldrüse führen kann.

Diese Gentherapie benötigt ca. 42 Injektionen, bis der Patient geheilt ist. Das klingt nicht so schlimm – allerdings kostet jede Injektion um die €50.000, eine vollständige Heilung schlägt so mit ungefähr €1,1 mio zu Buche.</p>\n<p>Autsch… Einerseits freut mich die Meldung an sich (Gentherapie <em>fuck yeah</em>), andererseits sind die Kosten im Moment halt noch kriminell hoch.

				"content_text": "Donnerstagmorgen sind dafür da, um festzustellen, dass heute erst Dienstag ist und die Sonne gerade untergegangen ist und _holy crap_, was für eine stümperhafte Einleitung.\n\nZwei Monate sind vergangen seit der letzten Ausgabe. So lang sollte die Pause eigentlich nicht sein, aber ich habe viel um die Ohren und den Kopf nicht frei genug fürs Schreiben. Passiert! Meine Hoffnung ist, dass 2015 ein besseres Jahr wird, in dem ich dann auch wieder mehr Luft für _NadZ_ haben werde.\n\nAber 2014 — was für ein Jahr! [17 Ausgaben _NadZ_](https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues) habe ich veröffentlich (inklusive dieser hier), bin 40 geworden, ich wurde [für den Grimme Online Award nominiert](http://zukun.tf/1nh685o), hab ihn nicht gewonnen und [meine Facebook-Seite](https://www.facebook.com/neuesausderzukunft) hat immer noch keine Million Gefälltmirs. Dafür habe ich einige tolle neue Leute kennengelernt, immer noch volles Haar und eine gewinnende Persönlichkeit. Also, passd scho’. ;)\n\nIch wünsche Euch ein paar stressfreie Weihnachtstage, und einen feinen Start ins neue Jahr …das uns wieder etwas weiter in die Zukunft bringt. Viel Spaß mit dieser #29, wir sehen uns 2015!\n\nBis zur nächsten Ausgabe,\n\n— [Carlo](mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de).\n\n---\n\n## Erste Gentherapie in Deutschland zugelassen\n\nIn Europa wurde erstmals eine Gentherapie am freien Markt zugelassen, und wo zuerst? In Deutschland! Seit Anfang November ist das Mittel namens Glybera erhältlich, das die _sehr_ seltene, erbliche Stoffwechselkrankheit Lipoproteinlipase-Defizienz heilt.[^fussnote-seltenheit]\n\nBei LPLD-Betroffenen sammelt sich mit der Nahrung eingenommenes Fett im Blut, was oft zu lebensgefährlichen, wiederholten Entzündungen der Bauchspeicheldrüse führen kann. Bisher gab es keine nachhaltigen Behandlungsmöglichkeiten. (Für mehr Hintergrundinfos empfehle ich den weiter unten verlinkten Motherboard-Artikel.)\n\nGlybera kann das richten! Diese Gentherapie benötigt ca. 42 Injektionen, bis der Patient geheilt ist. Das klingt nicht so schlimm – allerdings kostet jede Injektion um die €50.000, eine vollständige Heilung schlägt so mit ungefähr €1,1 mio zu Buche.\n\nAutsch… Einerseits freut mich die Meldung an sich (Gentherapie _fuck yeah_), andererseits sind die Kosten im Moment halt noch kriminell hoch. Egal: Fortschritt!\n\n### Was mich daran happy macht\n\nKlar, das ist wahnsinnig viel Geld, und der Patientenpool ist winzig, handelt es sich bei LPLD doch nicht um eine “Volkskrankheit” (was eigentlich ein Grund zum Feiern ist). Aber es zeigt mir, dass Gentherapien sich in Richtung Mainstream-Medizin bewegen, und bald auch für andere Krankheiten kommen werden.\n\nUnd wenn ich mir anschaue, wie stark z.B. die Kosten für Sequenzierung eines menschlichen Genoms in den letzten 10 Jahren gefallen sind (2004: ~$10 mio, 2014: ~$8.000), gehe ich davon aus, dass etwas Ähnliches auch bei Gentherapien passieren wird, sobald sie verbreiteter sind.\n\n### Links zum Thema\n\n- Meldung bei [Reuters: _“Exclusive: First gene therapy drug sets million-euro price record”_](http://zukun.tf/1ztNUTf)\n- Meldung bei der [Deutschen Apotheker-Zeitung: _“Rekordpreis für Orphan Drug : Glybera-Therapie kostet 1,1 Millionen Euro”_](http://zukun.tf/1zfdQgh)\n- Artikel bei [Motherboard: _“Die erste Gentherapie Europas kostet pro Patient so viel wie ein Krankenhaus”_](http://zukun.tf/1zfdTst)\n- Wikipedia: [Lipoproteinlipase](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoproteinlipase)\n- Artikel beim [US National Human Genome Research Institute: _DNA Sequencing Costs_](http://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/)\n\n[^fussnote-seltenheit]: Laut Deutscher Apotheker-Zeitung kommen in Europa etwa 150 bis 200 Patienten für eine Therapie mit Glybera infrage.\n\n\n---\n\n## Biotech & Medizin\n\n[**Gitter-Lichtscheiben-Mikroskop: Dreidimensionale Filme aus dem Innern der Zelle**](http://zukun.tf/1zfe47n) — Ein neuer Mikroskoptyp kann extrem scharfe und schnelle Bilder von zellulären und subzellulären Vorgängen schießen - und das auch über einen längeren Zeitraum. Entwickelt vom Nobelpreisträger Eric Betzig vom Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Maryland (USA) eröffnet er ganz neue Möglichkeiten für Biologen und Biochemiker:\n\n> _\\[Das neue Mikroskop ist\\]_ präzise, schnell und vor allem nichtinvasiv genug, um viele Vorgänge einzufangen, die sich bislang der Beobachtung entziehen. “Es erlaubt dreidimensionale Aufnahmen bei so hohen Geschwindigkeiten, dass man dynamische Prozesse in Zellen als kontinuierliche Ereignisse sieht und nicht als einzelne Schnappschüsse”, erklärt Betzig.\n\nBeeindruckende Videos und mehr gibts auf Englisch beim [Singularity HUB: _“Groundbreaking Microscope Makes 3D Video of Living Cells in Real Time”_](http://zukun.tf/1zfegDv).\n\n---\n\n[**Printing Circuitry for Bionic Implants**](http://zukun.tf/1ztOuka) — Der handelsübliche 3D-Drucker kann heutzutage problemlos Teile aus Polymeren oder Metall drucken. Von der Princeton-Universität in den USA wurde vor ein paar Tagen ein neues Druckverfahren vorgestellt, mit dem auch Halbleiter und andere Materialien gedruckt werden können, um so elektronische Systeme zu erstellen. Darüber hinaus entwickeln und verfeinern die Forscher Methoden, um derlei Elektronik mit biokompatiblen Materialien und auch lebendem Gewebe zu kombinieren, was mich natürlich sofort an exotische Implantate denken lässt.\n\nAls Demonstration wählten sie den Druck einer funktionierenden LED (bestehend aus sog. Quantenpunkten) auf einer Kontaktlinse. Ich erwarte die Vorstellung eines hochauflösenden Kontaktlinsen-Displays innerhalb der nächsten 12 Wochen… ;)\n\n---\n\n[**Harvard-Forscher entwickeln einen Magneten, der Giftstoffe aus dem Blut filtert**](http://zukun.tf/1CWLiuo) — Wissenschaftler am Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering in Boston (USA) haben im Oktober eine künstliche externe Milz präsentiert, die schnell Bakterien und Viren aus dem Blut filtern kann. Dieses Gerät ist nicht nur interessant für Patienten mit Immundefekten, sondern auch z.B. im Einsatz gegen Tropenkrankheiten wie Malaria – und auch Ebola.\n\n> In dem Prozess werden superglatte magnetische Kügelchen mit einen Durchmesser von 128 Millionstel Millimeter mit Opsoninen beschichtet—einem Protein, das sich an Kohlenhydrate auf Bakterien bindet—und dem Blut außerhalb des Körpers beigemischt. Ein stärkerer Magnet zieht die Erreger mit den Nano-Magnetperlen wieder aus dem Blut heraus. Dieses Verfahren filtert außer Bakterien auch Pilze und sogar Viren direkt aus dem fließenden Blut, ohne den Krankheitserreger vorher identifizieren zu müssen. Das spart wertvolle Zeit auf der Intensivstation, die für die Suche nach einem geeigneten Antibiotikum verstreicht.\n\nUnd auch hierzu gibts mehr Infos in der Form von Text & Video beim [Singularity HUB: _“Artificial Spleen ‘Cleans’ Blood of Pathogens”_](http://zukun.tf/1zff3Ez).\n\n---\n\n[**Amputee makes history controlling two modular prosthetic limbs**](http://zukun.tf/1ztPtAT) — Im Sommer schrieb ein Mann aus Colorado (USA) Geschichte, als er der erste vollständig Arm-Amputierte wurde, der beidseitig Prothesen trug und diese nach nur 10 Tagen Training auch kontrollieren konnte. Er trägt eine Art festes “Schulterkorsett”, das vom Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory Maryland (USA) entwickelt wurde, an dem die robotischen Gliedmaßen angebracht sind. Nervenpartien am Oberkörper werden mit einem Computersystem verbunden, dass die Impulse auswertet und in Bewegungen übersetzt. Der Träger “denkt” die Bewegungen, und die Prothesen setzen sie um. Das unglaublich [faszinierende Video](http://youtu.be/9NOncx2jU0Q) kann ich jedem nur ans Herz legen (4:33 min, englisch).\n\n---\n\n## Künstliche Intelligenz & Maschinenlernen\n\n[**The Three Breakthroughs That Have Finally Unleashed AI on the World**](http://zukun.tf/1CC4K0I) — Künstliche Intelligenz ist schon da, auch wenn sie noch nicht wirklich sichtbar und ziemlich begrenzt ist. Aber ihre Auswirkungen zeigen sich schon, zum Beispiel in der Gemeinde der Schachspieler:\n\n> The advent of AI didn’t diminish the performance of purely human chess players. Quite the opposite. Cheap, supersmart chess programs inspired more people than ever to play chess, at more tournaments than ever, and the players got better than ever. There are more than twice as many grand masters now as there were when Deep Blue first beat Kasparov. The top-ranked human chess player today, Magnus Carlsen, trained with AIs and has been deemed the most computer-like of all human chess players. He also has the highest human grand master rating of all time.\n>\n> If AI can help humans become better chess players, it stands to reason that it can help us become better pilots, better doctors, better judges, better teachers.\n\n---\n\n[**Machine Learning Reveals Genetic Control System**](http://zukun.tf/1A0qgNm) — Ein kanadisches Forscherteam der Universität von Toronto geht mit Hilfe maschinellen Lernens der Frage nach, welche DNA-Mutationen Krankheiten hervorrufen. Einfach zusammengefasst: sie bringen einem Computer bei, mittels sog. _Deep Learning_ in DNA-Daten nach versteckten und noch unbekannten Mutationen zu suchen, die Fehler beim “Zusammenbau” von Proteinen hervorrufen, und die damit Krankheiten wie Autismus, erbliche Krebsarten und spinale Muskelatrophie auslösen.\n\nUnd sie sind erfolgreich dabei, sagt die Pressemitteilung [der _U of T_, _“Machine learning reveals unexpected genetic roots of cancers, autism and other disorders”_](http://zukun.tf/1CC5kMa):\n\n> Once they had taught their system how to read the text of the genome, Frey’s team used it to search for mutations that cause splicing to go wrong.

Sicher, vieles davon steckt noch in den Kinderschuhen, aber vieles davon war vor 20 Jahren auch noch reine Science Fiction.  Ich wäre nicht verwundert, wenn in 20 Jahren Millionen von Menschen mehr Technologie *im* als *am* Körper tragen würden.  Dabei denke ich nicht an Elektronik im herkömmlichen Sinn, sondern an bionische Sensoren und Systeme, die Teil unserer Körper sind, wie auch immer sie dann aussehen mögen; an gezielte Mutationen, um Krankheiten oder Unzulänglichkeiten zu begegnen; an Nanotechnologie, die uns z.B. längere Lebensspannen beschert.  Vieles davon wird zu Normalität werden, ohne wird man sich fühlen wie ohne Smartphone heute.  So abwegig das jetzt auch klingen mag: erwähnte ich schon, dass die Forschungsabteilung der US-Regierung (DARPA) aktiv an Neuroprothesen zur Unterstützung des Erinnerungsvermögens arbeitet?  Das passiert, jetzt gerade.\n\nDie Menschheit entwickelt sich weiter.  In dem Moment, als der erste unserer haarigen Vorfahren ein Werkzeug benutzte, übernahmen wir eine aktive Rolle in der Evolution.  Wir waren und sind weiterhin stolz darauf, und sprechen von uns als \"Krone der Schöpfung\".\n\nDer Titel ist die reine Hybris, sicher.  Er kann und darf uns aber nicht dazu verleiten, auf der Stelle zu verharren.\n",

Quelle: Max Ortiz-Catalan</p>\n<p>Die Chalmers-Universität in Göteborg, Schweden, hat eine “Hirn-gesteuerte”, robotische Armprothese vorgestellt. Der Patient im Projekt ist ein LKW-Fahrer, der in den 2000ern seinen rechten Arm verloren hat, und dem vor über einem Jahr ein Titanimplantat am Oberarmknochen verankert wurde.

Ein gesunder Mensch muss nicht groß darüber nachdenken, ob und wie er seinen Arm heben will – der Impuls ist da, der Arm geht hoch, die Hand greift zu, etc. Das ist auch das Ziel dieser Prothesen: die Elektroden greifen die Impulse des Körpers am Armstumpf auf, und setzen sie in mechanische Bewegungen des Arms um. Je besser die Abtastung, desto größer die Chance auf korrekte Bewegungen. Bei externen, also auf der Haut angebrachten Elektroden können Umwelteinflüsse wie elektromagnetische Felder oder auch Temperaturschwankungen die Kommunikation stören. Diese Mankos treten hier nicht auf.</p>\n<p>Darüber hinaus besteht die Möglichkeit, die Kommunikation zwischen Arm und Körper auch zweiwegig zu machen – sensorische Informationen wie z.B. Druck könnten ans Hirn übermittelt werden.

(Bonuspunkte für die großartigen Fotos.)\n\n---\n\n[**Scientist Claims Menopause Will Not Exist in 20 Years Time**](http://zukun.tf/1zkCVMJ) – _“In 20 Jahren wird Menopause optional sein”_ sagt Dr. Aubrey de Grey der _Guardian Liberty Voice_. Fände ich super, denn das hiesse, das die Menschheit dann genug über den Körper und den Alterungsprozess weiss, um ihn abbremsen oder gar aufhalten zu können.\n\nEin paar detailliertere Ausführungen dazu gibt sein Kollege Michael Rae bei der _SENS Research Foundation_: [_“Rejuvenation Biotechnology: Toward the Indefinite Postponement of Menopause”_](http://zukun.tf/1zkDbv3).\n\n_Ob_ das optionale Verschieben der Menopause eine gute Idee ist, sei dahingestellt. (Ich persönlich finde es gut, wenn der Mensch mehr Optionen erhält.) Nichtsdestotrotz kann ich in dem Zusammenhang den zuvor verlinkten Artikel _“What Happens When We All Live to 100?”_ nur noch mehr empfehlen.\n\n---\n\n[**Harvard-Forscher entwickeln einen Magneten, der Giftstoffe aus dem Blut filtert**](http://zukun.tf/1CWLiuo) – Da waren die Kollegen von _Motherboard_ mal wieder schneller als ich: _“Die Sepsis ist ein hässlicher Bastard, mit dem eindeutig nicht zu spaßen ist: 18 Millionen Menschen erleiden weltweit pro Jahr eine Blutvergiftung, und jeder Dritte stirbt daran noch in der Behandlung. \\[…\\] Forscher am anliegenden Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering haben nun ein dialyseähnliches Gerät vorgestellt, das mit Hilfe von Magneten Krankheitserreger aus dem Blut fischt und so zahlreiche Leben retten kann.

Der internationale _“Vertrag über die Grundsätze zur Regelung der Tätigkeiten von Staaten bei der Erforschung und Nutzung des Weltraums einschließlich des Mondes und anderer Himmelskörper”_ von 1967 verbietet nämlich nur Staaten, von Himmelskörpern (wie z.B. Planeten und Monde) Besitz zu ergreifen; als der Vertrag geschlossen wurde, konnte sich noch niemand vorstellen, dass eines Tages eine nicht-staatliche Raumfahrtindustrie existieren würde.\n\nDie Frage ist nun, ob Firmen wie Planetary Resources[^fussnote-newspace], die in den USA registriert sind, überhaupt das Recht haben, auf Asteroid nach Rohstoffabbau zu betreiben. Diese Industrie steckt derzeit noch in den Kinderschuhen bzw. der Planungsphase, aber der Markt für derartige Dienstleistungen und Ressourcenbeschaffung dürfte in den nächsten Jahrzehnten mächtig wachsen, und Rechtssicherheit auf nationaler Ebene (und später auch auf internationaler) ist absolut notwendig für alle Firmen, die diese Industrie vorantreiben und sich in ihr bewegen.\n\nUnd nein, ich glaube nicht, dass die Praxis, die dieser Theorie folgen wird, noch viele Jahrzehnte entfernt ist.\n\n### Was mich daran happy macht\n\nIst es nicht toll, dass sich jetzt schon die Politik mit solchen Themen beschäftigen muss? ;) Mir ist klar, dass das nicht automatisch bedeutet, dass dieser Markt schon erschlossen und aufgeteilt ist, aber die Vorstellung ist anscheinend nicht nur für mich greifbar genug, dass politische Debatten dazu angestossen werden.\n\n### Links zum Thema\n\n- Joseph Stromberg in [Vox: _“Is asteroid mining legal?

Die Unternehmen wollen ihre Resourcen zusammenbringen, um gemeinsam neue Therapien für Patienten mit altersbedingten Leiden (wie u.A. neurodegenerative Krankheiten oder Krebs) zu finden, zu entwickeln und zu Marktreife zu bringen.\n\nSowohl AbbVie als auch Calico werden initial je $250 Mio in die Partnerschaft einbringen, mit Option auf weitere $500 Mio (pro Partner) zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt. Am Geld sollte es also nicht scheitern… Im Rahmen der Zusammenarbeit wird Calico eine Forschungs- und Entwicklungseinrichtung aufbauen, deren Fokus auf Wirkstoffforschung und -entwicklung liegen soll. AbbVie wird seinerseits wissenschaftliche und klinische Entwicklungshilfe geben, und helfen, die neuen Erfindungen am Markt zu etablieren.\n\nIn den letzten Monaten ging Calico mehrfach durch die Fachpresse, weil dort ein ziemlich beeindruckendes Team an Wissenschaftlern zusammengestellt wird, wie z.B. die Molekularbiologen Dr. Cynthia Kenyon (Fachgebiet: die Genetik des Alterungsprozesses) und Dr. Arthur Levinson (Zitat FAZ: _“Lichtgestalt in der Biotechnologieindustrie”_)\n\n### Was mich daran happy macht\n\nEs geht vorwärts mit Calico, die meinen das ernst und nehmen richtig Geld in die Hand!

Watson hat also in kürzester Zeit den “richtigen Riecher” bewiesen.\n\nAber Watson wird in den letzten Monaten auch auf anderen Feldern eingesetzt: u.A.\n\n- entwickelt er irrsinnige neue Rezepte aus Zutaten, die bisher vermutlich noch nie zusammen in einem Topf gelandet sind (ja, ich spreche wirklich über kreatives Kochen)\n- hilft er der Polizei von Tucson (USA) bei der Aufklärung der Entführung eines 6-jährigen Mädchens, in dem er in den zehntausenden Dokumenten, die mittlerweile in dem Fall zusammengekommen sind, nach Hinweisen und Verbindungen sucht, denen die Beamten dann nachgehen\n- kann er im Rahmen des _IBM Debating Technologies_-Projekt auf Zuruf Für- und Wider-Argumente zu beliebigen kontroversen Fragen konstruieren.\n\n### Was mich daran happy macht\n\nWir (als Spezies) forschen und forschen und forschen. Der Berg an Informationen und Wissen, den wir anhäufen, wächst schnell und unaufhörlich, es ist nahezu unmöglich, den kompletten Überblick zu erlangen. Einer der texanischen Mediziner des Watson-p53-Projekts brachte es auf den Punkt: _“Selbst wenn ein Wissenschaftler 5 Abhandlungen pro Tag lesen würde, wären fast 38 Jahre vonnöten, um all die Forschung, die allein bis heute zu diesem Protein stattgefunden hätte, vollständig zu verstehen.”_ Und das ist nur ein wissenschaftliches Projekt in einem einzelnen Forschungszweig, holy crap!\n\nAber: statt vor besagten Berg zu kapitulieren, erschaffen wir saucoole Technologie, die uns hilft, den Überblick zu behalten. Großartig!\n\n### Links zum Thema\n\n- Artikel bei [Fast Company: _“Now IBM’s Watson Tackles Questions That Have No Answers”_](http://zukun.tf/1AzAYHr)\n- Meldung des [Baylor College of Medicine: _“Study shows promise in automated reasoning, hypothesis generation over complete medical literature”_](http://zukun.tf/1smbI70)\n- Artikel in [Ausgabe #5: _“Dr. Watson”_](http://zukun.tf/1AzB1D4)\n- Artikel bei [The Verge: _“This is how supercomputers cook: IBM’s Watson dreams up creative dishes”_](http://zukun.tf/1AzB1mz)\n- Video einer kurzen Demonstration der [IBM Debating Technologies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJOtAzICzw#t=2726) (englisch)\n- Artikel bei [Mashable: _“How Big Data Could Help Prevent the Next Ferguson”_](http://mashable.com/2014/08/31/ibm-watson-ferguson/)\n\n---\n\n## Die Zukunft der Verhütung\n\nDie Parsemus Foundation, eine gemeinnützige Organisation, deren Ziel es ist, kostengünstige medizinische Ansätze für diverse Probleme zu finden, verkündete Anfang des Monats, dass ihr hochgradig interessantes Vasalgel nächstes Jahr in die klinische Testphase gehen wird. **Vasalgel ist ein Verhütungsmittel für die Herren** – dieses nicht hormonelle Polymer-Hydrogel wird in den Samenleiter gespritzt, setzt sich an dessen Wänden ab, und “püriert” dort die kleinen Soldaten, wenn sie Richtung Front vorbeischwimmen. (Ahem.)\n\nEine einzelne Injektion wirkt ~10 Jahre lang und kann jederzeit rückgängig gemacht werden, indem eine zweite Injektion vorgenommen wird. Deren Wirkstoff löst das Hydrogel auf, so dass es auf natürlichem Wege ausgeschwemmt werden kann. Das macht Vasalgel zu einer fantastischen Alternative zu Vasektomien. Keine Verödungen mehr, Kollegen, niemand muss Angst haben! Großartige Sache.\n\nEin verwandtes Projekt in Indien namens RISUG wird seit mehreren Jahren an Freiwilligen getestet, mit großem Erfolg; Vasalgel wurde in den Staaten entwickelt, um westlichen Standards zu genügen, und jetzt über mehrere Monate ebenfalls erfolgreich an Pavianen ausprobiert. Tests an westlichen Patienten beginnen 2015, die Parsemus-Leute peilen eine Markteinführung im Jahr 2016/2017 an.\n\n### Was mich daran happy macht\n\nIch habe vor ein paar Jahren einen sehr coolen Artikel auf WIRED darüber gelesen, und verfolge seither das Projekt durchaus aus Eigeninteresse. Ich halte ein Verhütungsmittel für Männer, das Hormonspritzen für die Damen nicht unähnlich ist, für überfällig — dahingehend, dass es eine zeitliche Begrenzung hat und reversibel ist. Ist doch super!\n\nAusserdem bin ich auf die gesellschaftlichen Auswirkungen neugierig, die eine Markteinführung mit sich bringen dürfte. Wenn Verhütungsmittel wie die Pille urplötzlich nicht mehr alleiniges Territorium der Frauen sind, sondern “Chancengleichheit” geschaffen wird. Wenn die Argumente _“Ich vertrage keine Kondome”_ (sicher, sicher) oder _“Die Dinger sind mir alle zu klein”_ (bwahahaha) nicht mehr automatisch bedeuten, dass Kerle komplett die Verantwortung abgeben dürfen.\n\nHah. ;)\n\n### Links zum Thema\n\n- Artikel im [Daily Beast: _“Male Birth Control, Without Condoms, Will Be Here by 2017”_](http://zukun.tf/1smbYTn)\n- Artikel von 2011 in [WIRED: _“The Revolutionary New Birth Control Method for Men”_](http://www.wired.com/2011/04/ff_vasectomy/all/1)\n\n---\n\n## Kampf den Autoimmunkrankheiten!\n\nDie Universität von Bristol (USA) vermeldete in der letzten Woche, dass eines ihrer Teams einen Weg gefunden hat, Autoimmunerkrankungen [^fussnote-aik] zu stoppen.\n\nSie fanden heraus, wie aggressive Zellen, die bei diesen Erkrankungen körpereigenes Gewebe angreifen, durch sog. Antigen-Immuntherapie effektiv in\n“Verteidigerzellen” umgewandelt werden können. Das Ziel dabei ist es, dem Körper die “Toleranz” gegenüber seinem eigenen Gewebe zurückzugeben, ohne (wie bei herkömmlichen Methoden) das Immunsystem zu schwächen. Das Interessante daran: es handelt sich, streng genommen, nicht um eine Heilung, denn die Krankheit wird nur dauerhaft “deaktiviert” – sie ruht!\n\nDie Studie aus Bristol bezieht sich auf Mäuse, das Projekt ist aber auf dem Weg in die klinischen Testphase. Verhalten ermutigende Nachrichten also für Menschen mit multipler Sklerose, Hashimoto-Thyreoiditis, Diabetes Typ 1 etc.\n\n### Was mich daran happy macht\n\nIch finde den Ansatz interessant: das Verfahren ist der Hyposensibilisierung bei Allergien nicht unähnlich. Dem Immunsystem wird beigebracht, bestimmte körpereigene Proteine nicht weiter zu attackieren.\n\nWie so oft steckt aber auch dieser neue Weg noch in den Kinderschuhen, klar. Mehr Forschung ist nötig, aber die grundsätzliche Herangehensweise ist neu und vielversprechend.\n\n### Links zum Thema\n\n- Meldung der [University of Bristol: _“Scientists discover how to ‘switch off’ autoimmune diseases”_](http://zukun.tf/1smaxUZ)\n- Wikipedia: [Autoimmunerkrankung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunerkrankung)\n- Wikipedia: [Hyposensibilisierung](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyposensibilisierung)\n- Diskussion in [/r/science](http://zukun.tf/1AzAwJ8)\n\n[^fussnote-aik]: _“Autoimmunerkrankung ist in der Medizin ein Überbegriff für Krankheiten, deren Ursache eine überschießende Reaktion des Immunsystems gegen körpereigenes Gewebe ist. Irrtümlicherweise erkennt das Immunsystem körpereigenes Gewebe als zu bekämpfenden Fremdkörper. Dadurch kommt es zu schweren Entzündungsreaktionen, die zu Schäden an den betroffenen Organen führen.”_ Danke, [Wikipedia](http://zukun.tf/1AzAst9).\n",

Der Hausarzt entnimmt Blut, das zu einem Labor geschickt wird, in dem ein paar teure Tests ausgeführt werden, und ein paar Tage später erklärt der Arzt dem Patienten, was das Problem ist, und/oder ordnet weitere Tests an — neue Blutentnahme, etc.</p>\n<p>Die US-Firma Theranos hat über die letzten zehn Jahre ein Blutlabor-System entwickelt, das ungefähr 70 verschiedene Tests automatisiert mit einer winzigen Menge Blut (ein bis zwei Tropfen = ~50 µl = 0.05 ml) ausführen kann. Diese Anzahl von Tests durchzuführen würde mit herkömmlichen Methoden <em>mehrere</em> der bekannten, großvolumigeren Blutproben benötigen, jede davon um die 4 ml.</p>\n<p><strong>Theranos’ Laborsystem ist vollautomatisiert</strong>, um menschliche Fehler weitgehend ausschliessen zu können — und um <strong>50-90% günstiger als Konkurrenzprodukte</strong> (auf dem US-Markt), was auch Krankenversicherungen und Ärzte freuen dürfte. Bluttests sind nämlich nicht wirklich billig, was einer der Gründe für die eingangs beschriebenen langwierigen Testläufe ist.

Der Hausarzt entnimmt Blut, das zu einem Labor geschickt wird, in dem ein paar teure Tests ausgeführt werden, und ein paar Tage später erklärt der Arzt dem Patienten, was das Problem ist, und/oder ordnet weitere Tests an — neue Blutentnahme, etc.\n\nDie US-Firma Theranos hat über die letzten zehn Jahre ein Blutlabor-System entwickelt, das ungefähr 70 verschiedene Tests automatisiert mit einer winzigen Menge Blut (ein bis zwei Tropfen = ~50 µl = 0.05 ml) ausführen kann. Diese Anzahl von Tests durchzuführen würde mit herkömmlichen Methoden _mehrere_ der bekannten, großvolumigeren Blutproben benötigen, jede davon um die 4 ml.\n\n**Theranos’ Laborsystem ist vollautomatisiert**, um menschliche Fehler weitgehend ausschliessen zu können — und um **50-90% günstiger als Konkurrenzprodukte** (auf dem US-Markt), was auch Krankenversicherungen und Ärzte freuen dürfte. Bluttests sind nämlich nicht wirklich billig, was einer der Gründe für die eingangs beschriebenen langwierigen Testläufe ist. Eine Ärztin beschränkt die Anzahl der gemachten Bluttests nämlich nicht immer nur deshalb, weil sie sich sicher ist, was die untersuchten Beschwerden auslöst, sondern oft auch aus Kostengründen. Manchmal wäre es hilfreich, mit einem Schlag 10-20 unterschiedliche Tests überprüfen zu lassen, aber das zahlt keine Kasse ohne Murren. Tja. Und schneller ist Theranos’ System auch, **oft liegen die Ergebnisse schon innerhalb weniger Stunden vor**.\n\nSehr interessant finde ich den infrastrukturellen Ansatz, den Theranos verfolgt: statt überall eigene Standorte zu eröffnen, hat die Firma hat einen Vertrag mit Walgreens abgeschlossen, einer US-Drogerie-Kette, die ohnehin schon das ganze Land abdeckt.

Die Mysterien verfliegen, aber die Ehrfurcht bleibt. Und unsere Instrumente werden besser, unser Blick schärfer, unser Gehör feiner: da ist so Vieles, das es noch zu entdecken gilt. Warum sollte dazu nicht auch eine physikalische Erklärung gehören, warum EmDrives eventuell doch funktionieren? :)\n\nAlles ist offen, und ich finds großartig!\n\n### Links zum Thema\n\n- Artikel bei [Wired: _“NASA validates ‘impossible’ space drive”_](http://zukun.tf/1oDtBNi)\n- [Reddit-Thread zum ersten Wired-Artikel](http://zukun.tf/1uGHUBk)\n- Artikel bei [Wired: _“10 questions about NASA’s ‘impossible’ space drive answered”_](http://zukun.tf/1oDtBwQ)\n- [Reddit-Thread zum zweiten Wired-Artikel](http://zukun.tf/1oDmHri)\n- Das [britische EmDrive](http://emdrive.com/)\n- Das [chinesische EmDrive](http://zukun.tf/1uGO3xe)\n- Artikel im [Discover Magazine: _“Did NASA Validate an “Impossible” Space Drive?

Über die letzten paar Jahre hinweg haben die zwei, zusammen mit ihren Helfern, ein neues Konzept für Straßen im 21. Jahrhundert entwickelt. Ihre Wege bestehen nicht länger aus Asphalt, sondern aus sechseckigen Glas-Segmenten, aus denen Fahrbahnen modular zusammengeschraubt werden. Die einzelnen Module sitzen dabei auf einer Art breiten Betonschalung, dadurch ist unter ihnen Platz für Kabel, Versorgungsleitungen und abfliessendes Regenwasser. Jedes Modul besteht aus mehreren Schichten — ganz oben das ultra-widerstandsfähige Sicherheitsglas, darunter die Elektronikkomponenten mit (u.A.) LEDs und Solarzellen.</p>\n<p>Das ermöglicht Straßen, Parkplätze und Nutzflächen, die nicht nur Fahrzeugen eine möglichst einfache Fortbewegung erlauben, sondern die auch:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>einfallendes Sonnenlicht in Strom umwandeln — die Segmente sind Solarmodule!</li>\n<li>sich selbst mit Strom versorgen, den Überschuss aber auch an andere Verbraucher (wie umliegende Häuser) abgeben können</li>\n<li>dank eingebetteter LEDs wechselnde Fahrbahnmarkierungen (bei Nacht, Gefahrenhinweise, Stauwarnungen etc.) ermöglichen</li>\n<li>flächendeckendere Verkehrsüberwachung erlauben</li>\n<li>durch ihre modulare Bauweise einfach und schnell repariert werden können</li>\n<li>sehr interessante Möglichkeiten für kommende autonome Fahrzeuge bieten, weil sie z.B. Elektroautos per Induktion während der Fahrt mit Strom versorgen könnten</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Die Brusaws nutzen ihren heimischen Hof als Testobjekt. Seit 2006 tüfteln sie hier an ihren Prototypen, die einen Teil ihrer Stellfläche pflastern, und verfeinern sie kontinuierlich. Ihr System funktioniert im Kleinen, aber sie sind davon überzeugt, dass es eben auch im Großen nur Vorteile mit sich bringt, gerade auch durch die Energieerzeugung. Ihre Rechnung diesbezüglich ist beeindruckend:</p>\n<p>Die USA verfügen derzeit über ~81.000 km² Nutzfläche (Straßen, Parkplätze, Radwege etc.). Würde man die mit ihren Panelen (230W, 18.5% Effizienz) zupflastern, und ginge man von 4 Stunden guter Sonneneinstrahlung pro Tag aus, so könnte man so im Jahr über <strong>21.800 Milliarden kWh</strong> erzeugen. Auf Deutschland übertragen, wo es derzeit geschätzt 18.000 km² solcher Flächen gibt, würde das jährlich <strong>~4.850 Milliarden kWh erneuerbare Energie</strong> bedeuten. (Zum Vergleich: laut AG Energiebilanzen e.V. haben wir in DE im Jahr 2013 insgesamt “nur” ~495 Milliarden kWh verbraucht.)</p>\n<p><em>“Aber… Straßen aus <strong>Glas</strong>‽”</em> Ja, keine Bange: das Spezialglas ist unglaublich bruch- und abriebfest, und jeder der hexagonalen Bausteine kann mit über 113 Tonnen Gewicht belastet werden. Und laut SR erlaubt die Oberfläche Fahrzeugen die gleiche Reibung bei Beschleunigen und Bremsen wie Asphalt, auch bei Nässe.</p>\n<h3 id=\"was-mich-daran-happy-macht\">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>\n<p>Clevere Straßen, die Strom erzeugen? Was kann man daran nicht mögen? Sicher, die initialen Kosten wären höher als bei normalen Asphaltstraßen, was sich aber durch die fortlaufende Energieerzeugung und auch die “eingebauten” Support von Versorgungsleitungen innerhalb weniger Jahre rechnen würde. Umstellung von Kupfer- auf Glasfaserleitungen? Dafür müsste man nicht mehr die Straße aufreissen, sondern lediglich ein paar der Panele abschrauben, herausheben und danach wieder einsetzen.</p>\n<p>Und es gibt eine Menge Menschen, die den Traum von intelligenteren Transportwegen teilen: Solar Roadways’ Crowdfunding-Kampagne auf Indiegogo, bei der das Ehepaar Brusaw um $1.000.000 gebeten hatte, um ihr Projekt voranzutreiben, steht im Moment schon bei ~$1.930.000, und läuft noch bis 20. Juni.</p>\n<h3 id=\"links-zum-thema\">Links zum Thema</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Artikel bei <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1k3XSmU\">Zukunft Mobilität: <em>“Solarautobahnen: stromerzeugende Straßen aus Glas und Solarzellen”</em></a> (Zahlen &amp; Fakten zur möglichen Energieausbeute in Deutschland!)</li>\n<li>Artikel der <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1k3TvbF\">Karlshochschule: <em>“Solar Roadways macht Straßen zum sicheren, umweltfreundlichen Kraftwerk”</em></a></li>\n<li>Website: <a href=\"http://solarroadways.com/\">Solar Roadways</a>, man beachte die Seite <a href=\"http://solarroadways.com/numbers.shtml\">mit den Zahlen &amp; Rechnungen</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/solar-roadways\">Indiegogo-Kampagne</a></li>\n<li>Website <a href=\"http://www.ag-energiebilanzen.de/\">AG Energiebilanzen e.V.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>PS: Danke an alle unter Euch, die mir Links zur Indiegogo-Kampagne geschickt haben! :)</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"superpolymere\">Superpolymere!</h2>\n<p>IBM hat eine neue Gattung von Polymeren entwickelt, die beeindruckende Eigenschaften besitzen: sehr leicht, dabei stärker als menschliche Knochen, unempfindlich gegen Lösemittel, selbstheilend, und vollständig recyclebar.

Nun, anfangs gingen die Entwickler noch davon aus, dass die Passagiere sich unsicher in den Fahrzeugen fühlen würden, und ggf. in die Fahrt eingreifen wollen. Das war die erste Zeit auch so, aber die Testfahrer fühlten sich schon nach wenigen Fahrten <em>derartig</em> wohlbehütet, dass sie sich nicht mehr auf den Verkehr konzentrierten — sie fielen als Korrektiv schlichtweg aus.

Heiter. :)</p>\n<p>Und wie hat das Google-Team die ganze Technik in die Fahrzeuge bekommen? Tja: hat es eigentlich gar nicht. Sicher, die Autos sind vollgestopft mit cleveren Systemen.

Nein, falsch: mein Hirn hat gelernt, auf mich zufliegende Objekte zu erkennen, Flugbahn, Rotation und Wahrscheinlichkeit einzuschätzen, und meinen Körper zu veranlassen, erfolgreich mit den Armen zu rudern, damit sie zur rechten Zeit am rechten Ort sind (zumindest meistens). Genau das bringen Forscher in der Schweiz derzeit einem robotischen System im Labor bei: sehen, verstehen, greifen/fangen, daraus lernen.

Das ‘Midfield Powering’ genannte Verfahren dürfte insbesondere für DIY-Cyborgs und Körperaufrüster, aber auch für die Medizin interessant sein.”_ Der Empfänger ist groß wie ein Reiskorn und wandelt drahtlos übertragene Energie in Saft für Implantate etc. um.\n",

Hurra!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"gdf11-das-jungbrunnen-protein\">GDF11: das Jungbrunnen-Protein</h2>\n<p>Drei neu veröffentlichte Studien, die die langjährige Arbeit zweier unabhängiger Forschungsgruppen in Cambridge und Kalifornien (USA) zusammenfassen, bringen mich zum fröhlichen Kichern: die Wissenschaftler untersuchten den Effekt eines Proteins namens GDF11, das im Blut junger Mäuse (und auch junger Menschen) vorkommt, aber so gut wie gar nicht mehr im Blut ihrer alten Artgenossen.</p>\n<p>Durch Bluttransfusionen, durch gezielte Injektionen und auch durch ein verstörendes Verfahren namens Parabiose <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> wurden alte Mäuse mit jenem Protein versorgt — und ihre Muskeln, Herzen und auch Hirne wurden wieder jugendlich. Die Ergebnisse sind dramatisch und verheissen Großes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Die im Alter erschlafften oder verhärteten Herzmuskeln wurden wieder geschmeidig und kräftig, die Herzen arbeiteten wie bei Jungtieren.</li>\n<li>In den Hirnen der alten Tiere bildeten sich neue Blutgefässe, und auch der Blutfluss wurde erhöht — ebenfalls wie bei Jungtieren, die Mäuse waren in Tests geistig agiler als ihre Artgenossen aus Kontrollgruppen.</li>\n<li>Die Muskeln regenerierten sich ebenfalls, die Tiere wurden leistungsfähiger und fitter.</li>\n<li>Der feine Geruchssinn der Nager kehrte zurück, sie schreckten vor unangenehmen Gerüchen ebenso schnell zurück wie die Jungen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Man könnte sagen: das Erhöhen des GDF11-Protein-Levels drehte bei den Mäusen für jedes untersuchte Organ die Uhr zurück.</strong> Und wie bereits erwähnt, kommt GDF11 ebenfalls in Homo Sapiens vor.</p>\n<p><strong>Aber:</strong> GDF11 ist nur ein Protein von vielen, und es ist sehr wahrscheinlich nicht <strong>das</strong> Allheilmittel gegen das Altern. Einige Wissenschaftler, die an den Studien beteiligt waren, und auch einige, die nichts damit zu tun hatten, vermuten, dass das Protein nur ein einzelner Baustein ist unter vielen, die noch unbekannt sind. Mehr Forschung ist nötig, und es ist nicht gesagt, dass sich die Ergebnisse der Studien 1:1 auf Menschen übertragen lassen. Und möglicherweise existieren auch Risiken, die sich erst in weiteren Experimenten zeigen — wer weiss.</p>\n<p>Also bleiben wir ruhig, hoffen wir auf das Beste und beobachten wir die Sache. (Diese Aufforderung geht in erster Linie an mich selbst.) Derweil sind die Forscher mit Risikokapitalgebern in Gesprächen, um rasch finanzielle Mittel für weitere Forschung und eventuelle prä-klinische Tests zu sichern. Sollten keine Showstopper auftreten, gehen sie von ersten klinischen GDF11-Tests an Menschen in den nächsten 3 bis 5 Jahren aus.</p>\n<p>Aber bei aller gebotenen Vorsicht sind dies in meinen Augen ganz, ganz famose Neuigkeiten. :)</p>\n<p>(Für etwas tiefergehende deutschsprachige Meldungen zum Thema empfehle ich die Artikel von Motherboard und NZZ, Links siehe weiter unten.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"links-zum-thema\">Links zum Thema</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Motherboard: <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1iiNV2W\"><em>“Ein neuer molekularer Jungbrunnen repariert Gehirn und Muskeln”</em></a></li>\n<li>Neue Zürcher Zeitung: <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1mzbx7m\"><em>“Das Rad der Zeit zurückdrehen: Blut als Jungbrunnen”</em></a></li>\n<li>Harvard Stem Cell Institute: <a href=\"http://hsci.harvard.edu/news/functioning-aged-brains-and-muscles-mice-made-younger\"><em>“Functioning of aged brains and muscles in mice made younger”</em></a></li>\n<li>The Boston Globe: <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1iiLHkf\"><em>“Blood from young mice shown to reverse aging: Three studies show rejuvenation; implications for humans uncertain”</em></a></li>\n<li>The Guardian: <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1iiNUvO\"><em>“Infusions of young blood may reverse effects of ageing, studies suggest”</em></a></li>\n<li>New York Times: <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1mzdvoy\"><em>“Young Blood May Hold Key to Reversing Aging”</em></a></li>\n<li>SciTech Daily: <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1iiNPID\"><em>“Researchers Show that GDF11 Improves Functioning of Aged Brains and Muscles”</em></a></li>\n<li>SciTech Daily: <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/Qb8vai\"><em>“Infusion of Young Blood Reverses Age-Related Impairments in Mice”</em></a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"nerven-aus-stahl\">Nerven aus Stahl</h2>\n<p>Forschern an der Tsinghua-Universität in Beijing (China) haben in Experimenten gezeigt, dass die Enden von durchtrennten Nerven mithilfe sog. flüssiger Metalle wieder verbunden werden können, so dass durch die Nerven wieder Signale übertragen werden. (Flüssige Metalle sind Metalle, deren Schmelzpunkt unterhalb der Zimmertemperatur liegt.) Im Labor verbanden die Forscher die Nervenenden eines durchtrennten Ochsenfrosch-Beinmuskels mit einem dünnen Strang einer Gallium-Indium-Selenium-Legierung. Die Signale, die sie dann an einem der Enden anlegten, liefen nahezu verlustfrei durch das sehr gut leitende Metall zum anderen Ende hin.</p>\n<p>Die Vision des Teams ist, durchtrennte Nervenpartien, die z.B. durch Unfälle entstanden sind, schnell umgehen zu können, um eine Heilung zu ermöglichen. Nerven wachsen pro Tag nur ca. 1 Millimeter, und es kann bei Verletzungen lange dauern, bis gekappte Enden sich wieder verbinden. In dieser Zeit liegt aber u.U. die Signalübertragung vom Hirn zu den verbundenen Muskeln brach, was nachhaltige Schäden mit sich bringen kann. Die Forscher arbeiten nun an speziellen “Nervenprothesen”, die die durchtrennten Sektionen überbrücken können, um das Wachstum der Nerven zu stimulieren und dabei auch die Muskelfunktionen zu erhalten.</p>\n<p>Die Idee und ihr Prototyp sind ziemlich vielversprechend, aber es gibt (wenig überraschend) noch einige Unklarheiten, z.B. wie der menschliche Körper auf das Metall reagieren würde, sowie ob und wie stark die Muskeln von einer solchen Behandlung profitieren würden.</p>\n<h3 id=\"was-mich-daran-happy-macht\">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>\n<p>Selbst nach Jahrzehnten der Forschung gibt es immer noch keine wirklich effektive Methoden für das Verbinden durchtrennter Nerven.

Sie wird mehrere Disziplinen bieten, u.A. Wettläufe für Träger bionischer Beinprothesen und auch virtuelle Rennen, die über Hirn-Computer-Schnittstellen ausgetragen werden. Die Gemeinsamkeit aller Disziplinen: sogenannte “Assistenzsysteme” sind nicht nur gestattet, sondern explizit erwünscht, ebenso wie robotische Technik.</p>\n<p>Die Organisatoren hoffen, dass ihr Cybathlon einen ähnlichen Effekt auf die Bionik hat wie der <em>Ansari X-Prize</em>, der über die letzten zwei Jahrzehnte den NewSpace-Boom <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> ausgelöst und befeuert hat, oder auch die <em>DARPA Grand Challenge</em>, die sich auf autonome Fahrzeuge fokussierte, und aus der u.A. Google X’ selbstfahrende Automobile hervorgingen.</p>\n<h3 id=\"was-mich-daran-happy-macht-1\">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>\n<p>Das ist die erste Sportveranstaltung, die ich freiwillig besuchen würde — das allein bringt mich schon aus der Fassung. ;)</p>\n<p>Ich denke, solch öffentliche “Spektakel” (im positivsten Sinne des Wortes) sind geeignete Instrumente, um die Menschheit langsam an die Idee zu gewöhnen, dass Prothesen und bionische Technik <del>langsam</del> die Labore verlassen. Wir werden sicherlich in nicht allzu ferner Zukunft den Punkt erreichen, wo der Grund für viele Implantate und Prothesen nicht zwangsläufig ein vorangeganger Unfall ist, sondern die bewusste Entscheidung ihrer Besitzer.</p>\n<p>Für einen (winzigen) Einblick in das, was heute schon möglich ist, und Ausblick auf das, was noch kommen kann &amp; wird, empfehle ich den aktuellen TED-Talk von Hugh Herr, dem Chef der Biomechatronics-Gruppe des MIT Media Lab: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/CDsNZJTWw0w\"><em>“The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance”</em></a> (Video, 19:00 min, englisch).</p>\n<h3 id=\"links-zum-thema-2\">Links zum Thema</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Website <a href=\"http://www.cybathlon.ethz.ch/\">CYBATHLON 2016: The Championship for Robot-Assisted Parathletes</a></li>\n<li>Artikel bei <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/SeEqbZ\">Golem: <em>“Schweizer richten Turnier für Cyberathleten aus”</em></a></li>\n<li>Artikel bei <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/SeEiZT\">Singularity Hub: <em>“Bionic Athletes With Exoskeletons, Robotic Limbs, And Brain-Control Devices To Compete In 2016 Cybathlon”</em></a></li>\n<li>Wikipedia: <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1a0Y9fw\">Ansari X-Prize</a></li>\n<li>Wikipedia: <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/SeEnNb\">DARPA Grand Challenge</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"protein-basierte-biosensoren\">Protein-basierte Biosensoren</h2>\n<p>In den letzten vier Jahren ist ein Team um Joshua Leonard, Assistenzprofessor für chemisches und biologisches Engineering an der Northwestern McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science, <sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> der Frage nachgegangen, ob und wie man einen Protein-basierten Biosensor auf einer organischen Zelle anbringen kann.</p>\n<p>Ein solcher Sensor könnte das Umfeld der Zelle überwachen, und bei bestimmten Gegebenheiten in ihr unterschiedliche Mechanismen auslösen. Zum Beispiel könnte ein solcher Sensor feststellen, wenn sich die Zelle neben einem Tumor befindet, ein Signal an den Zellkern abgeben, der dann die Produktion von Tumor-tötende Chemikalien oder Proteinen beginnt. Solch veränderte Zellen würden durch den Körper reisen, und ihre “Programme” triggern, wenn sie an der richtigen Stelle angekommen sind.</p>\n<p>Nun, <strong>Dr. Leonard’s Forschung war erfolgreich: seine Gruppe hat Mitte April eine derartige Technologie vorgestellt.</strong> Sie haben genau diese Art von Biosensor-Plattform entwickelt. Diese ist so konzipiert, dass mehrere Sensoren an eine einzelne modifizierte Zelle angedockt werden können, und sich dabei gegenseitig nicht ins Gehege kommen — Biomechanikern ist damit die Möglichkeit gegeben, für unterschiedliche Szenarien unterschiedliche Aktionen zu “programmieren”.</p>\n<h3 id=\"was-mich-daran-happy-macht-2\">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>\n<p>Die Behandlung von Krankheiten (z.B. Krebs) ist eine Sache. Die <em>punktgenaue</em> Behandlung von Krankheiten ist eine andere. Die neue Technologie, die das McCormick-Labor entwickelt hat, zielt auf die hyperlokale Behandlung von Problemen ab, die ohne die Schädigung des umgebenden Gewebes auskommt. Wobei ich da allerdings auch potentielle Anwendungsmöglichkeiten auf dem Gebiet der, ach, sagen wir der Langlebigkeitsforschung sehe. :)</p>\n<h3 id=\"links-zum-thema-3\">Links zum Thema</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Artikel der <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/SeI3P5\">McCormick School of Engineering: <em>“Building ‘Smart’ Cell-Based Therapies: Living devices may selectively kill cancer cells without disrupting healthy cells”</em></a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"zu-guter-letzt\">Zu guter Letzt…</h2>\n<p>+ <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1njkFKo\"><strong>Ein gemeinsames Projekt der Carnegie Mellon University und Disney Research (Pittsburgh, USA) hat einen 3D-Drucker für flauschige Sachen hervorgebracht.</strong></a> Das Konzept ist das gleiche wie bei herkömmlichen Druckern: die Maschine wird mit einem 3D-Modell gefüttert, und druckt es Schicht für Schicht aus. Nur können es in diesem Fall Teddies und Mützen sein, für die der Drucker Wolle und Kunststofffasern verfilzt. Heiss! Und für all jene, die jetzt sehnsüchtig Omas guter alter Handarbeit nachtrauern: müsst Ihr nicht, denn auch da gibt es Neues — auf <a href=\"http://maleknitting.de/\">meines Kollegen Lutz’ Strickblog MaleKnitting.de</a>. :)</p>\n<p>+ <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_CRS-3\"><strong>Am 18. April startete von Cape Canaveral aus eine neue Lieferung für die ISS.</strong></a> Lieferant (wie schon mehrfach vorher) ist die kalifornische Firma SpaceX. Dieser Start war aber etwas Besonderes: die erste der Stufen der Rakete vom Typ <em>Falcon 9</em> kehrte zur Erde zurück, um zu landen! Es handelte sich um den ersten “öffentlichen” SpaceX-Test in ihrem laufenden Projekt, Raketen wiederverwendbar zu machen (mehr dazu in <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1neYck0\">Ausgabe #2, <em>“Wirtschaftlichkeit… IN SPACE”</em></a>). Die Landung erfolgte bei diesem ersten Live-Test aus Sicherheitsgründen noch über dem offenen Meer — die Stufe bremste erfolgreich über dem Ozean ab, und wäre eine ebene Fläche und keine tosende See an dieser Stelle gewesen, hätte sie sich selbständig geparkt. Fantastisch! Warum das eine große Sache ist, hat Jason Dorrier sehr schön auf Singularity Hub zusammengefasst: <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1neYesa\"><em>“Can Elon Musk And SpaceX Take Space Travel From Evolutionary To Revolutionary?”</em></a>.</p>\n<p>+ Dass nicht alle Frauen weltweit die gleichen Rechte geniessen, ist bekannt (und zum Wahnsinnigwerden). <strong>Vor ein paar Wochen <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1qb5oQn\">startete die 18-jährige Inderin Amala Dasarathi deshalb eine Petition auf Change.org</a>, in der sie die Verkehrsbetriebe von Bangalore (BMTC) dazu aufrief, auf die wiederkehrende Belästigung von Frauen in ihren Bussen zu reagieren.</strong> Innerhalb kürzester Zeit kamen über 50.000 Unterschriften aus aller Welt zusammen, und Amala konnte Anfang dieser Woche einen Erfolg vermelden:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[…] Die Verkehrsbetriebe von Bangalore (BMTC) haben begonnen, in allen Bussen eine gut sichtbare Notruftelefonnumer für Frauen einzurichten. Der Geschäftsführer Kumar Pushkar hat direkt auf meine Petition mit einem Antwortschreiben reagiert!\nNeben der Telefonnummer wir es noch weitere Maßnahmen geben, wie z.B. spezielle Sitzbereiche nur für Frauen, ein Training für Busfahrer (zur Sensibilisierung für das Problem), Überwachungskameras in den Bussen und regelmäßige Aufklärungskampagnen. […]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Babyschritte, sicher — aber jeder kleine Erfolg zählt! Ja, auch solch eine Meldung gibt mir Hoffnung für die Menschheit.</p>\n<p>+ <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/channel/iss-hdev-payload\"><strong>Wer möchte einen Live-HD-Videostream von der ISS?</strong></a> Ihr möchtet einen Live-HD-Videostream von der ISS. Einige der Kamerakomponenten, die jetzt an der Station kleben, wurden u.A. von Schülern und Studenten entwickelt. Zum Vergleich: meine Schulprojekte in den 80ern drehten sich primär um das Sammeln von Flaschen und Altpapier ( <em>“Sekundärrohstoffe”</em>), dem Verunglimpfen des Klassenfeindes ( <em>“der böse Westen”</em>) sowie das Dummrumstehen in FDJ-Uniform ( <em>“für den Weltfrieden”</em>).

Diese ist so konzipiert, dass mehrere Sensoren an eine einzelne modifizierte Zelle angedockt werden können, und sich dabei gegenseitig nicht ins Gehege kommen — Biomechanikern ist damit die Möglichkeit gegeben, für unterschiedliche Szenarien unterschiedliche Aktionen zu “programmieren”.\n\n### Was mich daran happy macht\n\nDie Behandlung von Krankheiten (z.B. Krebs) ist eine Sache. Die _punktgenaue_ Behandlung von Krankheiten ist eine andere. Die neue Technologie, die das McCormick-Labor entwickelt hat, zielt auf die hyperlokale Behandlung von Problemen ab, die ohne die Schädigung des umgebenden Gewebes auskommt. Wobei ich da allerdings auch potentielle Anwendungsmöglichkeiten auf dem Gebiet der, ach, sagen wir der Langlebigkeitsforschung sehe. :)\n\n### Links zum Thema\n\n- Artikel der [McCormick School of Engineering: _“Building ‘Smart’ Cell-Based Therapies: Living devices may selectively kill cancer cells without disrupting healthy cells”_](http://zukun.tf/SeI3P5)\n\n[^fussnote-titel]: Das passt auf keine Visitenkarte.\n\n\n---\n\n## Zu guter Letzt…\n\n\\+ [**Ein gemeinsames Projekt der Carnegie Mellon University und Disney Research (Pittsburgh, USA) hat einen 3D-Drucker für flauschige Sachen hervorgebracht.**](http://zukun.tf/1njkFKo) Das Konzept ist das gleiche wie bei herkömmlichen Druckern: die Maschine wird mit einem 3D-Modell gefüttert, und druckt es Schicht für Schicht aus. Nur können es in diesem Fall Teddies und Mützen sein, für die der Drucker Wolle und Kunststofffasern verfilzt. Heiss! Und für all jene, die jetzt sehnsüchtig Omas guter alter Handarbeit nachtrauern: müsst Ihr nicht, denn auch da gibt es Neues — auf [meines Kollegen Lutz’ Strickblog MaleKnitting.de](http://maleknitting.de/). :)\n\n\\+ [**Am 18. April startete von Cape Canaveral aus eine neue Lieferung für die ISS.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_CRS-3) Lieferant (wie schon mehrfach vorher) ist die kalifornische Firma SpaceX. Dieser Start war aber etwas Besonderes: die erste der Stufen der Rakete vom Typ _Falcon 9_ kehrte zur Erde zurück, um zu landen! Es handelte sich um den ersten “öffentlichen” SpaceX-Test in ihrem laufenden Projekt, Raketen wiederverwendbar zu machen (mehr dazu in [Ausgabe #2, _“Wirtschaftlichkeit… IN SPACE”_](http://zukun.tf/1neYck0)). Die Landung erfolgte bei diesem ersten Live-Test aus Sicherheitsgründen noch über dem offenen Meer — die Stufe bremste erfolgreich über dem Ozean ab, und wäre eine ebene Fläche und keine tosende See an dieser Stelle gewesen, hätte sie sich selbständig geparkt. Fantastisch! Warum das eine große Sache ist, hat Jason Dorrier sehr schön auf Singularity Hub zusammengefasst: [_“Can Elon Musk And SpaceX Take Space Travel From Evolutionary To Revolutionary?”_](http://zukun.tf/1neYesa).\n\n\\+ Dass nicht alle Frauen weltweit die gleichen Rechte geniessen, ist bekannt (und zum Wahnsinnigwerden). **Vor ein paar Wochen [startete die 18-jährige Inderin Amala Dasarathi deshalb eine Petition auf Change.org](http://zukun.tf/1qb5oQn), in der sie die Verkehrsbetriebe von Bangalore (BMTC) dazu aufrief, auf die wiederkehrende Belästigung von Frauen in ihren Bussen zu reagieren.** Innerhalb kürzester Zeit kamen über 50.000 Unterschriften aus aller Welt zusammen, und Amala konnte Anfang dieser Woche einen Erfolg vermelden:\n\n> \\[…\\] Die Verkehrsbetriebe von Bangalore (BMTC) haben begonnen, in allen Bussen eine gut sichtbare Notruftelefonnumer für Frauen einzurichten. Der Geschäftsführer Kumar Pushkar hat direkt auf meine Petition mit einem Antwortschreiben reagiert!\n> Neben der Telefonnummer wir es noch weitere Maßnahmen geben, wie z.B. spezielle Sitzbereiche nur für Frauen, ein Training für Busfahrer (zur Sensibilisierung für das Problem), Überwachungskameras in den Bussen und regelmäßige Aufklärungskampagnen. \\[…\\]\n\nBabyschritte, sicher — aber jeder kleine Erfolg zählt! Ja, auch solch eine Meldung gibt mir Hoffnung für die Menschheit.\n\n\\+ [**Wer möchte einen Live-HD-Videostream von der ISS?**](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/iss-hdev-payload) Ihr möchtet einen Live-HD-Videostream von der ISS. Einige der Kamerakomponenten, die jetzt an der Station kleben, wurden u.A. von Schülern und Studenten entwickelt. Zum Vergleich: meine Schulprojekte in den 80ern drehten sich primär um das Sammeln von Flaschen und Altpapier ( _“Sekundärrohstoffe”_), dem Verunglimpfen des Klassenfeindes ( _“der böse Westen”_) sowie das Dummrumstehen in FDJ-Uniform ( _“für den Weltfrieden”_).

Abgefahrenes Konzept: um ein kaputtes Organ zu entlasten, unterstützen die Wissenschaftler es mit _einem komplett neuen_ Hilfsorgan.\n\nWas ich daran besonders interessant finde, ist die Herangehensweise von der rein mechanischen Seite, den die Mediziner gewählt haben: ein wichtiges Teil X in einem Kreislauf funktioniert nicht mehr korrekt, aber ein Ersatzteil dafür ist nicht verfügbar, also wie könnte man den Kreislauf sonst am Laufen halten? Das gefällt mir.\n\nIm Artikel befindet sich auch ein kurzes 5-Sekunden-Video, das das Organ bei der Arbeit zeigt.\n\n→ Artikel bei [KurzweilAI: _“A ‘mini heart’ to help return venous blood: A solution for chronic venous insufficiency, one of the most widespread diseases in the Western world”_](http://www.kurzweilai.net/a-mini-heart-to-help-return-venous-blood)\n\n---\n\n## \"Wahnsinnige Geschwindigkeit!\"\n\nMein Desktop-Rechner, ein Mac mini, hat einen tollen Prozessor, der machtvoll genug ist für alles, was ich ihm an Arbeit zuweise, und ich bin damit sehr glücklich. Der Prozessor hat 4 Kerne, die mit einer Geschwindigkeit von ~2,4 GHz (Gigahertz) operieren. Mein iPhone, mit dem ich auch sehr glücklich bin, arbeitet mit einer Geschwindigkeit von ~1,3 GHz.\n\nDas erwähne ich nur, weil es hilfreich ist, um die folgende Meldung einzuordnen.\n\nAn der National University von Singapur haben Forscher jetzt im Rahmen einer Studie einen Schaltkreis entwickelt, die mit Frequenzen von bis zu 245 THz (Terahertz) arbeitet — was ungefähr **das 100.000-Fache dessen ist, was der Prozessor meines eingangs erwähnten treuen Macs leistet**.\n\nIhre Erfindung fusst auf einem neuen physikalischen Prozess namens “quanten-plasmonische Tunnelung” ( _“quantum plasmonic tunneling”_), bei dem es um ultra-hochfrequente Oszillationen von Elektronen geht, die auf Nanoebene mit Licht gesteuert werden können.\n\nAls nächsten Schritt wollen die Teufelskerle aus Singapur die möglichen Integrationen ihrer neuen Technologie in “echte” elektronische Geräte untersuchen. Denn noch ist ihr Prototyp eben nur ein Prototyp: der Beweis der Machbarkeit einer Idee. Aber das wird schon… :)\n\n→ Meldung der [National University of Singapore: _“Scientists in Singapore develop novel ultra-fast electrical circuits using light-generated tunneling currents”_](http://www.science.nus.edu.sg/press-releases/890-scientists-in-singapore-develop-novel-ultra-fast-electrical-circuits-using-light-generated-tunneling-currents)\n",

Als unabhängige Wissenschaftler das taten, was gute Wissenschaft ausmacht, nämlich die Studie im Labor nachstellen, konnte so gut wie keiner von ihnen die Erkenntnisse der Japaner verifizieren; schlimmer noch, es fanden sich einige Unregelmäßigkeiten, die auf die Manipulation der Daten des Papiers hinweisen.\n\nTja, doof, es wäre schön gewesen. Auf der anderen Seite freue ich mich natürlich, dass das gute alte Peer-Review noch lebt und funktioniert. Und die Autorin der Studie, die Biologin Haruko Obokata, schwört weiterhin, dass ihre Arbeit eine solide Basis hat, und sie STAP-Zellen produziert hat.\n\nDer Keks ist also noch nicht komplett gegessen, die Untersuchungen des Falles dauern an.\n\n### Links zum Thema\n\n- Artikel in [The JapanTimes: _“Hasty Riken STAP report draws fire; Left unanswered is whether the cells, as authors claim, even exist”_](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/04/02/national/hasty-riken-stap-report-draws-fire/)\n- Artikel in der [SZ: _“Skandale made in Japan”_](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/35Z389/1928350/Skandale-made-in-Japan.html)\n- Story in [Ausgabe #14: _“Es gibt ihn doch, den guten Stress…”_](https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues/14-ausgabe-14/blurbs/87-es-gibt-ihn-doch-den-guten-stress)\n",

Craig Venter die Gründung seiner neuen Firma, Human Longevity, Inc. (HLI), deren Ziel es ist, die Forschung für ein längeres und gesünderes Leben voranzutreiben. <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> Zu diesem Zwecke wird HL die größte DNA-Sequenzierung der Geschichte angehen: pro Jahr sollen 40.000 menschliche Genome sequenziert und “kartographiert” werden.</p>\n<p>Die so gewonnenen DNA-Datensätze werden dann mit vielen anderen Informationen zu Gesundheit und körperlicher Verfassung (der teilnehmenden Patienten) referenziert, um so (hoffentlich) den molekularen Gründen für das Altern und altersbedingten Krankheiten auf die Schliche zu kommen.</p>\n<p>HLI’s grundlegende Vermutung ist, dass man, sollte man das Altern verlangsamen können, auch den damit verbundenen Krankheiten Einhalt gebieten könnte. Und mit solchen Informationen lässt sich Geld verdienen. (Der freie Markt etc.)</p>\n<p>Ob diese Vermutung richtig ist, wird sich zeigen. Die wissenschaftlichen Daten, die in der Art gesammelt und ausgewertet werden, dürften unabhängig davon für Biologie und Genetik allein schon ihrer Breite wegen sehr interessant sein. Ich nenne sowas gern “Kollateralerkenntnisse”.</p>\n<h3 id=\"was-mich-daran-happy-macht\">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>\n<p>Erstens: die Kosten für eine einzelne Sequenzierung liegen mittlerweile bei weniger als $1.000; die Sequenzierung an sich dauert weniger als 24 Stunden. Laut National Human Genome Research Institute (USA) lagen die Kosten dafür im Jahr 2001 noch bei $100.000.000 (ja, <em>$100 Millionen</em>) und nahm mehrere Monate Zeit in Anspruch.</p>\n<p>Zweitens: Die Idee ist nicht nur das Hirngespinst eines einzelnen Mannes. In der letzten Zeit sind mehrere Firmen gegründet würden, die das gleiche Ziel haben und/oder den gleichen Weg gehen. Dr. Venter geht davon aus, dass HLI’s 40.000 Scans pro Jahr nur der Anfang sind, und sein Team relativ bald auf 100.000 Sequenzierungen pro Jahr aufstocken können.</p>\n<p>Der Wettlauf nimmt Fahrt auf. Das macht mich verdammt happy. :)</p>\n<h3 id=\"links-zum-thema\">Links zum Thema</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Artikel in der <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/business/in-pursuit-of-longevity-a-plan-to-harness-dna-sequencing.html?_r=0\">New York Times: <em>“A Genetic Entrepreneur Sets His Sights on Aging and Death”</em></a></li>\n<li>Website <a href=\"http://www.humanlongevity.com/\">Human Longevity, Inc.</a></li>\n<li>Informationen zu Kostenentwicklung beim <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/\">National Human Genome Research Institute: <em>“DNA Sequencing Costs”</em></a></li>\n<li>Verwandter Artikel in <a href=\"https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues/5-ausgabe-5/blurbs/33-craig-venter-s-bio-drucker\">Ausgabe #5, <em>“Craig Venter’s Bio-Drucker”</em></a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"drohnen-es-geht-auch-friedlich\">Drohnen: es geht auch friedlich!</h2>\n<p>Drohnen. Die meisten Menschen denken, wenn sie das Wort “Drohnen” hören, vermutlich an militärische “Tod von oben”-Einsätze in Ländern, die man nie selbst besuchen würde. Oder auch die totale Überwachung durch den Staat und/oder privatsphärenaushebelnde Schlimmfinger.</p>\n<p>Aber Drohnen und UAVs <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> an sich, als Technologie, sollten keine Angst machen, haben sie doch ein gewaltiges Potential in vielen verschiedenen Einsatzfeldern, nicht nur dem militärischen. Genau wie andere technologische Entwicklungen in der Menschheitsgeschichte können sie unterschiedlich eingesetzt werden, und die Aggressions- bzw.

Wie war das nur vorher — wo haben wir nur drollige Katzenbilder, all die kostenlose Pornographie und unsere erbaulichen Neuigkeiten von Morgen herbekommen?\n\nMan möchte gar nicht darüber nachdenken. Schlimme Zeit.\n\nIn dieser Ausgabe habe ich wieder etwas an der Aufteilung bzw. am Format geschraubt. So gibts u.A. (auch aus Zeitmangel) einige kürzere Artikel, die ich mit einigen wenigen Sätzen und einem einzelnen Link zusammengefasst habe. Zu lang für _Zu guter Letzt_, zu kurz für das normale Artikelformat. Nicht wundern, ich habe also nicht geschludert, ich bin nur experimentierfreudig. ;)\n\nWenns Euch taugt, oder Ihr eine der Stories mögt, verbreitet sie bitte weiter! Mehr Leser → ein fröhlicher(er) Carlo. Danke!\n\nBis zum nächsten Mal,\n\n[—Carlo.](mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de)\n\n---\n\n## Human Longevity, Inc.\n\nAnfang März verkündete der US-Genetiker Dr. J. Craig Venter die Gründung seiner neuen Firma, Human Longevity, Inc. (HLI), deren Ziel es ist, die Forschung für ein längeres und gesünderes Leben voranzutreiben. [^fussnote-venter] Zu diesem Zwecke wird HL die größte DNA-Sequenzierung der Geschichte angehen: pro Jahr sollen 40.000 menschliche Genome sequenziert und “kartographiert” werden.\n\nDie so gewonnenen DNA-Datensätze werden dann mit vielen anderen Informationen zu Gesundheit und körperlicher Verfassung (der teilnehmenden Patienten) referenziert, um so (hoffentlich) den molekularen Gründen für das Altern und altersbedingten Krankheiten auf die Schliche zu kommen.\n\nHLI’s grundlegende Vermutung ist, dass man, sollte man das Altern verlangsamen können, auch den damit verbundenen Krankheiten Einhalt gebieten könnte. Und mit solchen Informationen lässt sich Geld verdienen. (Der freie Markt etc.)\n\nOb diese Vermutung richtig ist, wird sich zeigen. Die wissenschaftlichen Daten, die in der Art gesammelt und ausgewertet werden, dürften unabhängig davon für Biologie und Genetik allein schon ihrer Breite wegen sehr interessant sein. Ich nenne sowas gern “Kollateralerkenntnisse”.\n\n### Was mich daran happy macht\n\nErstens: die Kosten für eine einzelne Sequenzierung liegen mittlerweile bei weniger als $1.000; die Sequenzierung an sich dauert weniger als 24 Stunden. Laut National Human Genome Research Institute (USA) lagen die Kosten dafür im Jahr 2001 noch bei $100.000.000 (ja, _$100 Millionen_) und nahm mehrere Monate Zeit in Anspruch.\n\nZweitens: Die Idee ist nicht nur das Hirngespinst eines einzelnen Mannes. In der letzten Zeit sind mehrere Firmen gegründet würden, die das gleiche Ziel haben und/oder den gleichen Weg gehen. Dr. Venter geht davon aus, dass HLI’s 40.000 Scans pro Jahr nur der Anfang sind, und sein Team relativ bald auf 100.000 Sequenzierungen pro Jahr aufstocken können.\n\nDer Wettlauf nimmt Fahrt auf. Das macht mich verdammt happy. :)\n\n### Links zum Thema\n\n- Artikel in der [New York Times: _“A Genetic Entrepreneur Sets His Sights on Aging and Death”_](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/business/in-pursuit-of-longevity-a-plan-to-harness-dna-sequencing.html?_r=0)\n- Website [Human Longevity, Inc.](http://www.humanlongevity.com/)\n- Informationen zu Kostenentwicklung beim [National Human Genome Research Institute: _“DNA Sequencing Costs”_](https://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/)\n- Verwandter Artikel in [Ausgabe #5, _“Craig Venter’s Bio-Drucker”_](https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues/5-ausgabe-5/blurbs/33-craig-venter-s-bio-drucker)\n\n[^fussnote-venter]: Dr. Venter war schon einmal Thema eines Artikels, in Ausgabe #5: [_“Craig Venter’s Bio-Drucker”_](https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues/5-ausgabe-5/blurbs/33-craig-venter-s-bio-drucker).\n\n\n---\n\n## Drohnen: es geht auch friedlich!\n\nDrohnen. Die meisten Menschen denken, wenn sie das Wort “Drohnen” hören, vermutlich an militärische “Tod von oben”-Einsätze in Ländern, die man nie selbst besuchen würde. Oder auch die totale Überwachung durch den Staat und/oder privatsphärenaushebelnde Schlimmfinger.\n\nAber Drohnen und UAVs [^fussnote-uav] an sich, als Technologie, sollten keine Angst machen, haben sie doch ein gewaltiges Potential in vielen verschiedenen Einsatzfeldern, nicht nur dem militärischen. Genau wie andere technologische Entwicklungen in der Menschheitsgeschichte können sie unterschiedlich eingesetzt werden, und die Aggressions- bzw. Verteidigungsindustrie ist halt einfach sehr gut darin, neue Möglichkeiten zu erkennen und als erster Akteur schnell auszuloten. Ein gutes Beispiel dafür ist z.B. die Erfindung der Metallurgie: sie hat uns Schwerter gegeben, um “besser” Krieg führen zu können, klar. Aber später dann eben auch T-Träger für den Hausbau, Stahlkappen für Emo-Schuhwerk und ethisch unbedenkliche Löffel, um Nutella-Gläser auszukratzen.\n\nIn den letzten Wochen bin ich über zwei interessante, nicht-militärische Drohnen-Projekte gestolpert.\n\nZum einen haben die Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten (VAE) einen Wettbewerb mit einer Million USD Preisgeld gestartet, um ein **Drohnen-basiertes Liefernetzwerk für Regierungsstellen** aufzusetzen.

Eure Aufgabe für heute: vor die Tür gehen und mindestens zwei Minuten lang Sonne hamstern!</p>\n<p>Am letzten Wochenende las ich in der Bahn eine für mich neue, aber doch schon zwei Jahre alte Geschichte aus der Herzforschung, die mit einem Kalb beginnt, dem das Herz entfernt wurde, und das davon recht unbeeindruckt war — es lebte weiter. Das <em>musste</em> ich einfach zusammenfassen, und so findet Ihr u.A. diese sehr tolle Story in dieser Ausgabe.</p>\n<p>Themenwechsel: Die Tausendermarke ist durchbrochen, w00p! Ich danke Euch für Euer Interesse bisher — auch wenn ich das Gros meiner geschätzten Leserschaft nicht kenne, bedeutet mir das trotzdem sehr viel. Aber jetzt peile ich natürlich die 10.000 an. ;) Aus diesem Grund würde mir natürlich das Herz aufgehen, könntet Ihr die aktuelle Ausgabe oder einen der Artikel oder vielleicht auch einen der Artikel aus dem <a href=\"https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues\">Archiv</a> weiterempfehlen. Aber wenn nicht, ists selbstverständlich auch kein Beinbruch.</p>\n<p>So, und wenn Ihr Fragen, Hinweise auf coole Geschichten &amp; Entwicklungen oder vielleicht Kritik habt, <a href=\"mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de\">schreibt mir eine Mail</a>, darüber freue ich mich immer.</p>\n<p>Bis in zwei Wochen,</p>\n<p>—Carlo.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"kernfusion-hurra\">Kernfusion, hurra!</h2>\n<p>Mit 192 Hochleistungslasern haben US-Forscher erstmalig eine Kernfusion erzeugt, die in sich mehr Energie freigesetzt hat, als ihre Erzeugung verbraucht hat. Fortschritt!</p>\n<p>Aber so einfach ist das dann doch nicht. Die reine Energiemenge, die die Laser in Wasserstoffisotope pumpten, um deren Atomkerne zu verschmelzen, war tatsächlich niedriger als die Ausbeute. Und das ist auch ein großer Erfolg! Nur war diese Ausbeute halt dieses mal noch winzig: ~14 Kilojoule. Aber der gesamte Energieverbrauch der kompletten Anlage—mit ihren Lasern, Kondensatoren, Steuereinheiten, Computern etc.—war dabei noch ca. 28.000× größer als das Ergebnis. Anders gesagt: um 1 Energieeinheit zu erzeugen, mussten 28.000 Einheiten investiert werden. Man kann also sagen, dass es noch Optimierungsbedarf gibt.</p>\n<p>Davon unberührt: der technische Prozess ist faszinierend. Die 192 Laser werden in eine Goldkapsel gefeuert, in der sich ein sog. Kunststoff-Pellet mit einem Durchmesser von 2 mm befindet. An den Innenwänden dieses Pellets ist der “Treibstoff” hauchdünn aufgetragen: eine Mischung aus Wasserstoffisotopen, Tritium und Deuterium. Wenn das Laserlicht jetzt auf die Goldkapsel trifft, gibt diese heftige Röntgenstrahlung ab, was wiederum das Pellet erhitzt und zur Implosion bringt. Um diesen Effekt zu erzielen, mussten die Laser im Nanosekundenbereich aufeinander abgestimmt werden. Irre.</p>\n<p>Bitte nicht daheim nachmachen, Kinder!</p>\n<h3 id=\"was-mich-daran-happy-macht\">Was mich daran happy macht</h3>\n<p>Kernfusion ist ein relativ alter Traum. Sie hat das Potential zur alternativen Form der Energieerzeugung, ohne CO2-Ausstoß während des Betriebs und weniger strahlendem Abfall als herkömmliche Reaktoren. Fusionsreaktoren liessen sich gefahrlos abschalten, was auch nicht uninteressant ist.</p>\n<p>Ich <em>mag</em> neue alternative Energieformen, ich sehe sie als klaren Indikator für technischen Fortschritt. Im Jahr 1914 konnte sich sicher niemand vorstellen, auf Kohle zu verzichten, und die Idee, Atome zu spalten oder zu verdichten, oder auch den Sonnenschein “anzuzapfen”, waren Hirngespinste.

Die Frage klingt abwegig, ist sie interessanterweise aber gar nicht.</p>\n<p>Herzunterstützende Systeme gibt es schon seit vielen Jahren. Die vermutlich bekanntesten Geräte dieser Gattung sind Herz-Lungen-Maschinen, aber es gibt auch kleinere Geräte, um dem geschwächten Herz eines Patienten unter die Arme zu greifen.

				"content_text": "Donnerstagmorgen sind dafür da, um sich über die ganz persönliche Energiewende zu freuen, die stattfindet, wenn man sich in die Frühlingssonne stellen und grinsend Energie tanken kann. Eure Aufgabe für heute: vor die Tür gehen und mindestens zwei Minuten lang Sonne hamstern!\n\nAm letzten Wochenende las ich in der Bahn eine für mich neue, aber doch schon zwei Jahre alte Geschichte aus der Herzforschung, die mit einem Kalb beginnt, dem das Herz entfernt wurde, und das davon recht unbeeindruckt war — es lebte weiter. Das _musste_ ich einfach zusammenfassen, und so findet Ihr u.A. diese sehr tolle Story in dieser Ausgabe.\n\nThemenwechsel: Die Tausendermarke ist durchbrochen, w00p! Ich danke Euch für Euer Interesse bisher — auch wenn ich das Gros meiner geschätzten Leserschaft nicht kenne, bedeutet mir das trotzdem sehr viel. Aber jetzt peile ich natürlich die 10.000 an. ;) Aus diesem Grund würde mir natürlich das Herz aufgehen, könntet Ihr die aktuelle Ausgabe oder einen der Artikel oder vielleicht auch einen der Artikel aus dem [Archiv](https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues) weiterempfehlen. Aber wenn nicht, ists selbstverständlich auch kein Beinbruch.\n\nSo, und wenn Ihr Fragen, Hinweise auf coole Geschichten & Entwicklungen oder vielleicht Kritik habt, [schreibt mir eine Mail](mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de), darüber freue ich mich immer.\n\nBis in zwei Wochen,\n\n—Carlo.\n\n---\n\n## Kernfusion, hurra!\n\nMit 192 Hochleistungslasern haben US-Forscher erstmalig eine Kernfusion erzeugt, die in sich mehr Energie freigesetzt hat, als ihre Erzeugung verbraucht hat. Fortschritt!\n\nAber so einfach ist das dann doch nicht. Die reine Energiemenge, die die Laser in Wasserstoffisotope pumpten, um deren Atomkerne zu verschmelzen, war tatsächlich niedriger als die Ausbeute. Und das ist auch ein großer Erfolg! Nur war diese Ausbeute halt dieses mal noch winzig: ~14 Kilojoule. Aber der gesamte Energieverbrauch der kompletten Anlage—mit ihren Lasern, Kondensatoren, Steuereinheiten, Computern etc.—war dabei noch ca. 28.000× größer als das Ergebnis. Anders gesagt: um 1 Energieeinheit zu erzeugen, mussten 28.000 Einheiten investiert werden. Man kann also sagen, dass es noch Optimierungsbedarf gibt.\n\nDavon unberührt: der technische Prozess ist faszinierend. Die 192 Laser werden in eine Goldkapsel gefeuert, in der sich ein sog. Kunststoff-Pellet mit einem Durchmesser von 2 mm befindet. An den Innenwänden dieses Pellets ist der “Treibstoff” hauchdünn aufgetragen: eine Mischung aus Wasserstoffisotopen, Tritium und Deuterium. Wenn das Laserlicht jetzt auf die Goldkapsel trifft, gibt diese heftige Röntgenstrahlung ab, was wiederum das Pellet erhitzt und zur Implosion bringt. Um diesen Effekt zu erzielen, mussten die Laser im Nanosekundenbereich aufeinander abgestimmt werden. Irre.\n\nBitte nicht daheim nachmachen, Kinder!\n\n### Was mich daran happy macht\n\nKernfusion ist ein relativ alter Traum. Sie hat das Potential zur alternativen Form der Energieerzeugung, ohne CO2-Ausstoß während des Betriebs und weniger strahlendem Abfall als herkömmliche Reaktoren. Fusionsreaktoren liessen sich gefahrlos abschalten, was auch nicht uninteressant ist.\n\nIch _mag_ neue alternative Energieformen, ich sehe sie als klaren Indikator für technischen Fortschritt. Im Jahr 1914 konnte sich sicher niemand vorstellen, auf Kohle zu verzichten, und die Idee, Atome zu spalten oder zu verdichten, oder auch den Sonnenschein “anzuzapfen”, waren Hirngespinste. Und kaum 100 Jahre später machen wir genau das und noch viel mehr. :)\n\n### Links zum Thema\n\n- Artikel in der [SZ: _“Physiker gewinnen Energie mit Kernfusion”_](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/verschmelzung-von-atomkernen-physiker-gewinnen-energie-mit-kernfusion-1.1887820)\n- Artikel im [Guardian: _“Sustainable nuclear fusion breakthrough raises hopes for ultimate green energy”_](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/feb/12/nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-green-energy-source)\n- Blogpost auf [Real Clear Science: _“Sorry, But Fusion Power Result Was Disappointing”_](http://www.realclearscience.com/articles/2014/02/14/sorry_but_fusion_power_result_was_disappointing_108509.html)\n- Artikel auf [KurzweilAI: _“Scientists achieve fuel gain exceeding unity in confined fusion implosion”_](http://www.kurzweilai.net/scientists-achieve-fuel-gain-exceeding-unity-in-confined-fusion-implosion)\n\n---\n\n## Leben ohne Puls\n\nBraucht der Mensch seinen Herzschlag? Die Frage klingt abwegig, ist sie interessanterweise aber gar nicht.\n\nHerzunterstützende Systeme gibt es schon seit vielen Jahren. Die vermutlich bekanntesten Geräte dieser Gattung sind Herz-Lungen-Maschinen, aber es gibt auch kleinere Geräte, um dem geschwächten Herz eines Patienten unter die Arme zu greifen. Oft sind das sog. LVAD, _“left ventricular assist devices”_, Implantate zur Unterstützung der linken Herzkammern, die das mit Sauerstoff angereicherte Blut von der Lunge in den Rest des Körpers pumpen. Das Herz soll dadurch entlastet werden.\n\nDas Problem dabei ist die Mechanik. Ein menschliches Herz schlägt pro Jahr ca. 35 Mio mal — das macht ihm auf Dauer kein mechanischer Ersatz nach. Vor ungefähr 30 Jahren kamen dann einige Mediziner auf die Idee, statt eines pumpenden Aufbaus einen reinen Durchflussmechanismus einzusetzen: das Blut wird durch eine sich kontinuierlich drehende Schraube auf Trab gebracht.

Die Japaner entnahmen Mäusen Blut- und Hautzellen, und setzten diese ausserhalb des Körpers kurzzeitigem Stress aus—wie z.B. einem leichten Säurebad, Hitze oder mechanischem Druck. Die Zellen verwandelten sich daraufhin zu pluripotenten Stammzellen, also Zellen, aus denen viele andere Gewebetypen entstehen, u.A. Hirn, Herz, Lunge, Haut, Knochen etc.</p>\n<p>Zwei Dinge beeindrucken an ihrer neuen Methode. Erstens, dass sie komplett ohne das Einschleusen von Genen durch Retroviren auskommt, das bei “herkömmlichen” Methoden wie der künstlichen Reprogrammierung eingesetzt wird (siehe <a href=\"https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues/1-ausgabe-1/blurbs/3-stammzellen-forschung-jetzt-mit-weniger-petrischalen\">NadZ #1, <em>“Stammzellen-Forschung: Jetzt mit weniger Petrischalen”</em></a>). Und zweitens, dass die Stress-Prozedur weniger als eine Stunde in Anspruch nimmt! (Das Säurebad dauerte ungefähr 30 min.)</p>\n<p>Die so gewonnenen STAP-Zellen <sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> lassen sich genau wie embryonale Stammzellen im Labor nahezu unbegrenzt vermehren, und das ohne ethische Bedenken. Sie entwickelten sich, als sie wieder in die Mäusekörper eingeschleust wurden, zu normalem Gewebe und Organen.</p>\n<p>Chris Mason, Lehrstuhl für Bioprocessing in der regenerativen Medizin am University College London, der nicht an der Studie beteiligt war, bezeichnete die Technik als <em>“die einfachste, kostengünstigste und schnellste Methode”</em> für die Erzeugung von pluripotenten aus erwachsenen Zellen. <em>“Sollte [diese Technik] für Menschen funktionieren, könnte sie der</em> game changer <em>sein, der dann unterschiedlichste Zelltherapien ermöglicht, die des Patienten eigene Zellen als Anfangsmaterial nutzen—das Zeitalter der personalisierten Medizin wäre endlich angebrochen.”</em></p>\n<p>Bisher wurde die neue Technik nur erfolgreich mit Zellen von Nagern getestet. Laut Haruko Obokata laufen u.A. aber Labor-Experimente mit menschlichen Zellen, und unabhängige Labore überprüfen die neue Technik generell auf Herz und Nieren. Man darf gespannt sein!</p>\n<p>Lustige Randnotiz: Obokata’s Studie wurde mehrfach für die Veröffentlichung abgelehnt. Erst, als sie mehrere verlangte Gegenproben erbracht hatte, konnte sie ihre Kollegen dazu bringen, ihre Ergebnisse nicht als Hirngespinst oder Fabrikation abzutun.

Die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt!\n\n**NadZ** geht mit großen Schritten auf den 1000. Abonnenten zu, der in den nächsten paar Tagen “eintreffen” dürfte. [^0-1] Ich bin so aufgeregt!

[^0-2] ;)\n\nIch danke Euch allen fürs Weiterempfehlen, und versuche, weiterhin den Nerv zu treffen, der Euch dazu veranlasst. Zum Beispiel auch dieses Mal, mit Neuem aus u.A. der Stammzellenforschung, der Nanotechnik und Dresden. Es geht voran, immer voran…\n\nBei Fragen, Themenvorschlägen, Lob oder Kritik [freue ich mich über eine Mail](mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de) oder [einen Tweet](https://twitter.com/municode)!\n\nBis in zwei Wochen,\n\n—Carlo.\n\nPS: Neues auch aus der Kryptowährungswelt! Die **NadZ**-Kaffeekasse akzeptiert jetzt auch Bitcoin und Dogecoin. Die Adressen findet Ihr in der Sidebar. :)\n\n[^0-1]: Merke: ich benutze den Ausdruck absolut genderneutral. Laut meiner nicht existenten Auswertungen sind ca. 83% aller **NadZ**-Leser weiblich, was ich super finde.\n\n[^0-2]: Gilt nicht für die BILD.\n\n\n---\n\n## Es gibt ihn doch, den guten Stress…\n\n…zumindest in der Stammzellenforschung.\n\nWas Haruko Obokata und ihre Kollegen vom RIKEN-Zentrum für Entwicklungsbiologie in Kobe, Japan, in den letzten fünf Jahren Forschung herausgefunden haben, überraschte Ende Januar Biologen weltweit. Die Japaner entnahmen Mäusen Blut- und Hautzellen, und setzten diese ausserhalb des Körpers kurzzeitigem Stress aus—wie z.B. einem leichten Säurebad, Hitze oder mechanischem Druck. Die Zellen verwandelten sich daraufhin zu pluripotenten Stammzellen, also Zellen, aus denen viele andere Gewebetypen entstehen, u.A. Hirn, Herz, Lunge, Haut, Knochen etc.\n\nZwei Dinge beeindrucken an ihrer neuen Methode. Erstens, dass sie komplett ohne das Einschleusen von Genen durch Retroviren auskommt, das bei “herkömmlichen” Methoden wie der künstlichen Reprogrammierung eingesetzt wird (siehe [NadZ #1, _“Stammzellen-Forschung: Jetzt mit weniger Petrischalen”_](https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues/1-ausgabe-1/blurbs/3-stammzellen-forschung-jetzt-mit-weniger-petrischalen)). Und zweitens, dass die Stress-Prozedur weniger als eine Stunde in Anspruch nimmt! (Das Säurebad dauerte ungefähr 30 min.)\n\nDie so gewonnenen STAP-Zellen [^14-1-1] lassen sich genau wie embryonale Stammzellen im Labor nahezu unbegrenzt vermehren, und das ohne ethische Bedenken. Sie entwickelten sich, als sie wieder in die Mäusekörper eingeschleust wurden, zu normalem Gewebe und Organen.\n\nChris Mason, Lehrstuhl für Bioprocessing in der regenerativen Medizin am University College London, der nicht an der Studie beteiligt war, bezeichnete die Technik als _“die einfachste, kostengünstigste und schnellste Methode”_ für die Erzeugung von pluripotenten aus erwachsenen Zellen. _“Sollte \\[diese Technik\\] für Menschen funktionieren, könnte sie der_ game changer _sein, der dann unterschiedlichste Zelltherapien ermöglicht, die des Patienten eigene Zellen als Anfangsmaterial nutzen—das Zeitalter der personalisierten Medizin wäre endlich angebrochen.”_\n\nBisher wurde die neue Technik nur erfolgreich mit Zellen von Nagern getestet. Laut Haruko Obokata laufen u.A. aber Labor-Experimente mit menschlichen Zellen, und unabhängige Labore überprüfen die neue Technik generell auf Herz und Nieren. Man darf gespannt sein!\n\nLustige Randnotiz: Obokata’s Studie wurde mehrfach für die Veröffentlichung abgelehnt. Erst, als sie mehrere verlangte Gegenproben erbracht hatte, konnte sie ihre Kollegen dazu bringen, ihre Ergebnisse nicht als Hirngespinst oder Fabrikation abzutun. Hartnäckigkeit zahlt sich halt doch aus. :)\n\n### Was mich daran happy macht\n\nWenn diese Technik in Menschen anwendbar wäre, könnten im Labor schnell und sicher Stammzellen aus den erwachsenen Zellen von Patienten erzeugt werden. Auf relativ kurze Sicht hiesse das, dass z.B. bei Herzproblemen kostengünstig in der Petrischale Herzzellen des jeweiligen Patienten gezüchtet werden könnten, die das Durchspielen von personalisierten Behandlungsmöglichkeiten erlauben würden—welche Medikamente sprechen an, welche sind schädlich? Und das ohne “Live-Tests” am vermutlich ohnehin schon geschwächten Patienten.\n\n### Links zum Thema\n\n- Artikel im [Guardian: _“Simple way to make stem cells in half an hour hailed as major discovery”_](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jan/29/make-stem-cells-major-discovery-acid-technique)\n- Artikel in der [FAZ: _“Machen wir es wie die Karotte”_](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wissen/stammzellen-aus-dem-saeurebad-machen-wir-es-wie-die-karotte-12775531-p3.html?printPagedArticle=true)\n- Artikel bei [ScienceNews: _“A little acid or a tight squeeze can turn a cell stemlike”_](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/little-acid-or-tight-squeeze-can-turn-cell-stemlike)\n- Artikel im [Sydney Morning Herald: _“‘Grow your own’ stem cells a game changer, say scientists”_](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/grow-your-own-stem-cells-a-game-changer-say-scientists-20140130-hvaer.html)\n- [RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology](http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/cdb/cdsp/cell_reprogram/)\n\n[^14-1-1]: “STAP”: Akronym für _“Stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency”_, was sich mit _“durch Stimulus angeregte Aneignung von Pluripotenz”_ übersetzen lässt.\n\n\n---\n\n## Handprothesen mit Gespür\n\nVor neun Jahren verlor der Däne Dennis Aabo Sørensen durch einen Unfall seine Hand, seitdem ist er auf eine Prothese angewiesen.

Ein Jahr näher an der Zukunft, OMG! :P</p>\n<p>Mein Jahr begann gut: wie in <a href=\"https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues/12-ausgabe-12\">der letzten Ausgabe</a> angekündigt, habe ich in den letzten paar Wochen zusammen mit meinem guten Freund, Entwickler, Berater, intergalaktischem Weltraumhelden und DJ <a href=\"http://mans.de/\">Hendrik</a> die Technik hinter <strong>NadZ</strong> komplett neugeschrieben. Und hui, die Zukunft sieht jetzt noch toller aus! Das neue System erlaubt es mir nicht nur, Newsletter wie bisher zu verschicken, nein, jede Ausgabe erscheint zeitgleich auch im Web. Wie zum Beispiel <a href=\"https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues/13-ausgabe-13\">diese hier</a>, die Ihr gerade lest. (Und ja, es gibt auch einen <a href=\"https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues.atom\">RSS-Feed</a>.)</p>\n<p><strong>Aber keine Panik, liebe Leser, für Euch ändert sich erstmal gar nichts.</strong> Wenn Ihr die neuen Ausgabe weiterhin per Email erhalten wollt, bleibt alles beim Alten. Am Donnerstagmorgen machts weiterhin “pling”, und DIE TOLLE ZUKUNFT schwappt aus der Inbox. Aber etwas feiner sieht der Newsletter jetzt schon aus.</p>\n<p>Wenn Ihr dagegen die neue Ausgabe lieber im Browser lesen wollt, so geht das jetzt noch komfortabler als vorher. <a href=\"https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/\">Die neue Website</a> sieht nur auf den ersten Blick aus wie die alte (ich habe auf der Frontpage die Aufteilung grob beibehalten), aber spätestens beim <a href=\"https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues\">Blick ins Archiv</a> dürfte klar sein, dass ich <em>ein wenig</em> an der Site gearbeitet habe. :) <strong>Ein komplett neuer Look fürs Archiv und die Artikel</strong>, mit aufgeräumter Typographie, schöner Darstellung von Fußnoten, einer Kleinfamilie mit Hund in einer fliegenden Untertasse und klareren Optionen fürs Weiterempfehlen. (Ab jetzt können nicht nur komplette Ausgaben geteilt werden, sondern auch gezielt einzelne Meldungen—auf Twitter, Facebook, Google+ und per Mail.) Und die Site ist jetzt auch gut lesbar auf kleineren Screens, d.h. sowohl auf dem Laptop als auch auf dem Smartphone, es bleibt schick.</p>\n<p>So, das war zum technischen Kurzabriss. Und wir sind noch lange nicht fertig—in den nächsten Monaten wird da noch Einiges passieren. :)</p>\n<p><strong>Und es gibt noch eine Änderung.</strong> Wie ich in <a href=\"https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues\">den letzten Ausgaben</a> schon erwähnt habe, entpuppte mein selbst gestellter Wochenrhythmus doch als etwas zu ambitioniert. Aus diesem Grund <strong>erscheint <em>Neues aus der Zukunft</em> ab jetzt alle 14 Tage</strong>. Das gibt mir mehr Zeit für die einzelnen Ausgaben, was sowohl meinem Nervenkostüm als auch der Qualität gut tun dürfte.</p>\n<p>So, das war mal ein langes Editorial! Wenn Ihr Fragen, Meinungen oder Kritik zu den Änderungen oder der aktuellen Ausgabe haben solltet, <a href=\"mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de\">schreibt mir eine Mail</a>! Ich mag Feedback—daran ändert sich auch dieses Jahr nichts. :)</p>\n<p>Geniesst den Rest des Januars. Bis in zwei Wochen,</p>\n<p>—Carlo.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"585960--20\">…—58—59—60 … 20?</h2>\n<p>Kurz vor Weihnachten ging eine Studie der Harvard Medical School, USA, und der Universität von New South Wales, Australien, durch die Fachpresse. Es wurde eine Ursache für das Altern in Säugetieren gefunden, die potentiell rückgängig gemacht werden kann.</p>\n<p>In ihren Untersuchungen an Mäusen stellten die Forscher fest, dass mit zunehmendem Alter die Kommunikation innerhalb ihrer Zellen nachliess. Je mehr sie nachliess, desto schneller alterten die Tiere. Sie verabreichten den Mäusen daraufhin ein Molekül, das im menschlichen Körper natürlich produziert wird, und das Kommunikationsnetzwerk in älteren Nagern wurde wiederhergestellt.</p>\n<p>Das Team um David Sinclair, Professor für Genetik an der Harvard Medical School, entdeckte einen komplexen Ablauf in Zellen, der mit einer Chemikalie namens NAD beginnt und mit einem Molekül endet, das die Aktivitäten zwischen dem Zell- und dem mitochondrialen Genom koordiniert. So lange der Informationsfluss zwischen den Genomen reibungslos funktioniert, bleiben die Zellen und ihre Abwehrmechanismen gesund. Mit fortschreitendem Alter des Organismus nimmt auch der NAD-Level ab, und in Folge verschlechtert sich diese Kommunikation.

				"content_text": "Na, das hat ja gut geklappt mit dem _“Ich bin Mitte Januar wieder da”_—der Jänner ist nahezu vorbei, wir sind alle in 2014 angekommen. Ein Jahr näher an der Zukunft, OMG! :P\n\nMein Jahr begann gut: wie in [der letzten Ausgabe](https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues/12-ausgabe-12) angekündigt, habe ich in den letzten paar Wochen zusammen mit meinem guten Freund, Entwickler, Berater, intergalaktischem Weltraumhelden und DJ [Hendrik](http://mans.de/) die Technik hinter **NadZ** komplett neugeschrieben. Und hui, die Zukunft sieht jetzt noch toller aus! Das neue System erlaubt es mir nicht nur, Newsletter wie bisher zu verschicken, nein, jede Ausgabe erscheint zeitgleich auch im Web. Wie zum Beispiel [diese hier](https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues/13-ausgabe-13), die Ihr gerade lest. (Und ja, es gibt auch einen [RSS-Feed](https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues.atom).)\n\n**Aber keine Panik, liebe Leser, für Euch ändert sich erstmal gar nichts.** Wenn Ihr die neuen Ausgabe weiterhin per Email erhalten wollt, bleibt alles beim Alten. Am Donnerstagmorgen machts weiterhin “pling”, und DIE TOLLE ZUKUNFT schwappt aus der Inbox. Aber etwas feiner sieht der Newsletter jetzt schon aus.\n\nWenn Ihr dagegen die neue Ausgabe lieber im Browser lesen wollt, so geht das jetzt noch komfortabler als vorher. [Die neue Website](https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/) sieht nur auf den ersten Blick aus wie die alte (ich habe auf der Frontpage die Aufteilung grob beibehalten), aber spätestens beim [Blick ins Archiv](https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues) dürfte klar sein, dass ich _ein wenig_ an der Site gearbeitet habe. :) **Ein komplett neuer Look fürs Archiv und die Artikel**, mit aufgeräumter Typographie, schöner Darstellung von Fußnoten, einer Kleinfamilie mit Hund in einer fliegenden Untertasse und klareren Optionen fürs Weiterempfehlen. (Ab jetzt können nicht nur komplette Ausgaben geteilt werden, sondern auch gezielt einzelne Meldungen—auf Twitter, Facebook, Google+ und per Mail.) Und die Site ist jetzt auch gut lesbar auf kleineren Screens, d.h. sowohl auf dem Laptop als auch auf dem Smartphone, es bleibt schick.\n\nSo, das war zum technischen Kurzabriss. Und wir sind noch lange nicht fertig—in den nächsten Monaten wird da noch Einiges passieren. :)\n\n**Und es gibt noch eine Änderung.** Wie ich in [den letzten Ausgaben](https://neues-aus-der-zukunft.de/issues) schon erwähnt habe, entpuppte mein selbst gestellter Wochenrhythmus doch als etwas zu ambitioniert. Aus diesem Grund **erscheint _Neues aus der Zukunft_ ab jetzt alle 14 Tage**. Das gibt mir mehr Zeit für die einzelnen Ausgaben, was sowohl meinem Nervenkostüm als auch der Qualität gut tun dürfte.\n\nSo, das war mal ein langes Editorial! Wenn Ihr Fragen, Meinungen oder Kritik zu den Änderungen oder der aktuellen Ausgabe haben solltet, [schreibt mir eine Mail](mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de)! Ich mag Feedback—daran ändert sich auch dieses Jahr nichts. :)\n\nGeniesst den Rest des Januars. Bis in zwei Wochen,\n\n—Carlo.\n\n---\n\n## …—58—59—60 … 20?\n\nKurz vor Weihnachten ging eine Studie der Harvard Medical School, USA, und der Universität von New South Wales, Australien, durch die Fachpresse. Es wurde eine Ursache für das Altern in Säugetieren gefunden, die potentiell rückgängig gemacht werden kann.\n\nIn ihren Untersuchungen an Mäusen stellten die Forscher fest, dass mit zunehmendem Alter die Kommunikation innerhalb ihrer Zellen nachliess. Je mehr sie nachliess, desto schneller alterten die Tiere. Sie verabreichten den Mäusen daraufhin ein Molekül, das im menschlichen Körper natürlich produziert wird, und das Kommunikationsnetzwerk in älteren Nagern wurde wiederhergestellt.\n\nDas Team um David Sinclair, Professor für Genetik an der Harvard Medical School, entdeckte einen komplexen Ablauf in Zellen, der mit einer Chemikalie namens NAD beginnt und mit einem Molekül endet, das die Aktivitäten zwischen dem Zell- und dem mitochondrialen Genom koordiniert. So lange der Informationsfluss zwischen den Genomen reibungslos funktioniert, bleiben die Zellen und ihre Abwehrmechanismen gesund. Mit fortschreitendem Alter des Organismus nimmt auch der NAD-Level ab, und in Folge verschlechtert sich diese Kommunikation. Wenn sie zu sehr ins Stocken gerät, nimmt die Produktion der Mitochondrien ab (die Energieerzeuger der Zellen), und die Anzeichen von Alterung mehren sich.\n\nWarum der NAD-Level nach und nach schwindet, ist noch unklar. Was passiert, wenn man älteren Mäusen einen körpereigenen Stoff [^3-1] zuführt, den ihre Zellen in NAD umwandeln, ist jetzt dagegen bekannt: nach ca. 1 Woche Behandlung, in denen 2-jährige Mäuse diesen Stoff verabreicht bekamen, war ihr Muskelgewebe wieder auf einem Stand wie bei 6 Monate alten Mäusen. **Auf Menschen übertragen wären das 60-Jährige mit der Muskelkraft von 20-Jährigen.** [^3-2]\n\nDr. Nigel Turner, einer der Co-Autoren der Studie, sagte dem _Guardian_ in einem Interview, dass eine “magische Tablette”, die das Alter zurückdreht, noch einige Jahre auf sich warten lassen wird, schon allein wegen der Kosten—derzeit würde eine Tagesdosis des besagten Stoffes für einen Menschen um die $50.000 kosten.\n\n_“Die Leute denken, dass es bei der sog. Anti-Aging-Forschung darum geht, Menschen 200 Jahre alt werden zu lassen, aber das Ziel ist eigentlich, ihnen dabei zu helfen, bis ins hohe Alter hinein fitter und gesünder zu leben”_, sagte Turner. Der Fokus dieses Forschungsprojekts lag auf Muskeln, aber könnte seiner Aussage nach möglicherweise bei verschiedenen anderen Organen zur Anwendung kommen, und helfen, viele Krankheiten wie Krebs, Demenz und Typ-2-Diabetes zu verzögern oder zu verhindern.\n\nDie Wissenschaftler denken, noch dieses Jahr mit klinischen Tests beginnen zu können.\n\n_Links zum Thema:_\n\n- Wikipedia: [Mitochondrium](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrium)\n- Mitteilung der [_Harvard Medical School_: “A New—and Reversible—Cause of Aging”](http://hms.harvard.edu/news/genetics/new-reversible-cause-aging-12-19-13)\n- Artikel bei [_The Guardian_: “Anti-ageing compound set for human trials after turning clock back for mice”](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/20/anti-ageing-human-trials)\n\n[^3-1]: Der Stoff wurde nicht näher spezifiziert, also bleiben Selbstversuche wohl aus.

Dabei handelt es sich um einen Neurostimulator für Epileptiker. Das Gerät wird unter die Schädeldecke des Patienten implantiert, und überwacht die elektrischen Aktivitäten in den Teilen des Gehirns, die für die epileptische Krampfanfälle verantwortlich sind. Wenn es dort Unregelmäßigkeiten wahrnimmt, liefert es eine nicht wahrnehmbare elektrische Stimulation, um diese Störungen zu normalisieren.</p>\n<p>Die FDA stellte in ihrem 3-monatigen Tests fest, dass knapp ein Drittel der überwachten Patienten einen Rückgang ihrer Anfälle um 50% erfuhr. NeuroPace gaben in ihrer Pressemitteilung an, dass es in ihren Langzeittests nach 2 Jahren schon 55% der Patienten waren. Nicht schlecht.</p>\n<p>Trotz hohem Wow-Faktor ( <em>“Medizinische Zulassung für <strong>Hirnimplantate</strong>!!1”</em>) sollte aber klar sein, dass dieser Neurostimulator nicht das eigentliche Problem behebt—er unterdrückt “nur” die Symptome. Für manch einen Betroffenen dürfte das allerdings schon eine Verbesserung der Lebensqualität darstellen.</p>\n<p>Was mich daran fasziniert: dies ist schon die zweite Story über Neurostimulatoren, über die ich in den letzten 6 Monaten gestolpert bin. (Die erste war der 39-jährige Andrew Johnson in Neuseeland, der einen Stimulator implantiert bekam, um seiner Parkinson-Krankheit etwas entgegenzusetzen. Das kurze Video im Artikel (siehe Links zum Thema) ist beeindruckend und beklemmend zugleich.)

Wenn diese einen gesunden Schwellenwert überschreiten, sendet der Regelkreis Botenstoffe aus, die dem Körper Sättigung signalisieren. Wenn die Werte sich normalisieren, wird die Produktion der Botenstoffe wieder eingestellt.</p>\n<p>Das Ergebnis im Labor: Fettleibige Mäuse mümmelten weniger vom reichlich vorhandenen Futter, und nahmen nach und nach ab. Als sie ihr “Idealgewicht” erreichten (und durchschnittliche Blutfett-Werte), aßen sie wieder normal.</p>\n<p>Auch, wenn die Resultate nicht direkt auf Menschen übertragbar sind, so ist das doch ein ermutigender Schritt zum Ziel hin, das wachsende Gewichtsproblem weltweit in den Griff zu bekommen. Laut WHO sind mehr als die Hälfte der Menschen in Industrieländern übergewichtig, jeder Dritte davon stark. Je höher das Übergewicht, desto höher das Risiko auf Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen und Diabetes Typ 2, beides häufige Todesursachen in westlichen Industrienationen.</p>\n<p><em>Links zum Thema:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Artikel auf <a href=\"http://www.kurzweilai.net/a-genetically-engineered-weight-loss-implant\">KurzweilAI: “A genetically engineered weight-loss implant”</a></li>\n<li>Meldung der <a href=\"https://www.ethz.ch/de/news-und-veranstaltungen/eth-news/news/2013/11/implantierbare-schlankmacher.html\">ETH Zürich: “Implantierbare Schlankmacher”</a></li>\n<li>Putziges Bonus-Video! <a href=\"http://youtu.be/SMWi7CLoZ2Q\">“Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom”</a>(…alisierte Blutfett-Werte!)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"hautzellen-in-lungenzellen-transformiert\">Hautzellen in Lungenzellen transformiert</h2>\n<p>US-Wissenschaftler am Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) haben es erstmals geschafft, Hautzellen in Lungenzellen umzuwandeln. Ihr neuentwickeltes Verfahren hat großes Potential: es ermöglicht die bessere Erforschung von Lungenkrankheiten, erweiterte Arzneimitteltests und (längerfristig) auch, Lungengewebe für Transplantationen züchten zu können.</p>\n<p>In den letzten Jahren hat die Wissenschaft viel erreicht: aus Hautzellen gewonnene Stammzellen können u.A. in Herz-, Leber- und Nervenzellen umgewandelt werden, bis jetzt jedoch noch nicht in Lungenzellen. Zwar liegt eine klinische Anwendung dieser neuen Technik noch mehrere Jahre in der Zukunft, die Meldung stimmt mich aber doch positiv: derzeit sind Patienten, die eine Lungentransplantation erhielten, nämlich im Durchschnitt alle fünf Jahre auf einen neuen Lungenspender angewiesen.

Ich mag Feedback.\n\nBis nächste Woche,\n\n—Carlo.\n\n---\n\n## Schrittmacher fürs Hirn\n\nDie US-amerikanische _Food and Drug Administration_ (FDA, die Lebensmittelüberwachungs- und Arzneimittelzulassungsbehörde) hat dem sog. “NeuroPace RNS® System” die medizinische Zulassung erteilt. Dabei handelt es sich um einen Neurostimulator für Epileptiker. Das Gerät wird unter die Schädeldecke des Patienten implantiert, und überwacht die elektrischen Aktivitäten in den Teilen des Gehirns, die für die epileptische Krampfanfälle verantwortlich sind. Wenn es dort Unregelmäßigkeiten wahrnimmt, liefert es eine nicht wahrnehmbare elektrische Stimulation, um diese Störungen zu normalisieren.\n\nDie FDA stellte in ihrem 3-monatigen Tests fest, dass knapp ein Drittel der überwachten Patienten einen Rückgang ihrer Anfälle um 50% erfuhr. NeuroPace gaben in ihrer Pressemitteilung an, dass es in ihren Langzeittests nach 2 Jahren schon 55% der Patienten waren. Nicht schlecht.\n\nTrotz hohem Wow-Faktor ( _“Medizinische Zulassung für **Hirnimplantate**!!1”_) sollte aber klar sein, dass dieser Neurostimulator nicht das eigentliche Problem behebt—er unterdrückt “nur” die Symptome. Für manch einen Betroffenen dürfte das allerdings schon eine Verbesserung der Lebensqualität darstellen.\n\nWas mich daran fasziniert: dies ist schon die zweite Story über Neurostimulatoren, über die ich in den letzten 6 Monaten gestolpert bin. (Die erste war der 39-jährige Andrew Johnson in Neuseeland, der einen Stimulator implantiert bekam, um seiner Parkinson-Krankheit etwas entgegenzusetzen. Das kurze Video im Artikel (siehe Links zum Thema) ist beeindruckend und beklemmend zugleich.) Wir sind Dir auf der Schliche, Hirn! :)\n\nWeltweit leiden ca. 65 mio Menschen an Epilepsie.\n\n_Links zum Thema:_\n\n- Artikel auf [SingularityHUB: “FDA Approves Brain Implant To Monitor And Autonomously Respond To Epileptic Seizures”](http://singularityhub.com/2013/11/27/fda-approves-brain-implant-to-monitor-and-autonomously-respond-to-epileptic-seizures/)\n- Artikel zu Andrew Johnson auf [NPR: “The Man With A ‘Battery Operated Brain’”](http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2013/06/25/195521917/the-man-with-a-battery-operated-brain)\n- Wikipedia: [Epilepsie](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsie)\n- Produktseite [Neuropace RNS® System](http://www.neuropace.com/product/overview.html) (englisch)\n\n---\n\n## Implantierbare Schlankmacher\n\nBiotechniker der Eidgenössischen Technischen Hochschule Zürich (Schweiz) haben einen implantierbaren, genetischen Regulator entwickelt, der Blutfett-Werte in Mäusen überwacht. Wenn diese einen gesunden Schwellenwert überschreiten, sendet der Regelkreis Botenstoffe aus, die dem Körper Sättigung signalisieren. Wenn die Werte sich normalisieren, wird die Produktion der Botenstoffe wieder eingestellt.\n\nDas Ergebnis im Labor: Fettleibige Mäuse mümmelten weniger vom reichlich vorhandenen Futter, und nahmen nach und nach ab. Als sie ihr “Idealgewicht” erreichten (und durchschnittliche Blutfett-Werte), aßen sie wieder normal.\n\nAuch, wenn die Resultate nicht direkt auf Menschen übertragbar sind, so ist das doch ein ermutigender Schritt zum Ziel hin, das wachsende Gewichtsproblem weltweit in den Griff zu bekommen. Laut WHO sind mehr als die Hälfte der Menschen in Industrieländern übergewichtig, jeder Dritte davon stark. Je höher das Übergewicht, desto höher das Risiko auf Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen und Diabetes Typ 2, beides häufige Todesursachen in westlichen Industrienationen.\n\n_Links zum Thema:_\n\n- Artikel auf [KurzweilAI: “A genetically engineered weight-loss implant”](http://www.kurzweilai.net/a-genetically-engineered-weight-loss-implant)\n- Meldung der [ETH Zürich: “Implantierbare Schlankmacher”](https://www.ethz.ch/de/news-und-veranstaltungen/eth-news/news/2013/11/implantierbare-schlankmacher.html)\n- Putziges Bonus-Video! [“Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom”](http://youtu.be/SMWi7CLoZ2Q)(…alisierte Blutfett-Werte!)\n\n---\n\n## Hautzellen in Lungenzellen transformiert\n\nUS-Wissenschaftler am Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) haben es erstmals geschafft, Hautzellen in Lungenzellen umzuwandeln. Ihr neuentwickeltes Verfahren hat großes Potential: es ermöglicht die bessere Erforschung von Lungenkrankheiten, erweiterte Arzneimitteltests und (längerfristig) auch, Lungengewebe für Transplantationen züchten zu können.\n\nIn den letzten Jahren hat die Wissenschaft viel erreicht: aus Hautzellen gewonnene Stammzellen können u.A. in Herz-, Leber- und Nervenzellen umgewandelt werden, bis jetzt jedoch noch nicht in Lungenzellen. Zwar liegt eine klinische Anwendung dieser neuen Technik noch mehrere Jahre in der Zukunft, die Meldung stimmt mich aber doch positiv: derzeit sind Patienten, die eine Lungentransplantation erhielten, nämlich im Durchschnitt alle fünf Jahre auf einen neuen Lungenspender angewiesen. Ihnen könnte aller Voraussicht nach dauerhaft geholfen werden, könnte man neue Lungen aus ihren eigenen Zellen züchten. Bald…!\n\n_Links zum Thema:_\n\n- Pressemitteilung bei [EurekAlert!: “Human stem cells converted to functional lung cells”](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-12/cumc-hsc112713.php)\n- Wikipedia: [Lungentransplantation](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungentransplantation)\n\n---\n\n## Gesellschaft: Alkoholkonsum rückläufig!\n\nNichts beweist doch eindeutiger, wie schlecht es um unsere Gesellschaft steht, als die ständige Zunahme des Alkoholkonsums, oder? Immer dieser Leistungsdruck und immer dieser Stress, das kann man ja auch nur aushalten, indem man sich ab und zu ‘mal die Kante gibt! Und dann diese Alkoholikertreffen, wie z.B. das Oktoberfest in München—peinlich, was da getrunken wird! _\\[Ey! —Anm. Carlo\\]_\n\nDoof an diesem Standpunkt ist nur, das er völlig falsch ist. Die World Health Organization (WHO) teilt uns dieses Jahr mit, das in Deutschland der Alkoholkonsum seit 40 Jahren ständig rückläufig ist: von 15 Litern 100%igem[^1] pro Person Mitte der Siebziger—umgerechnet ca. 600 halbe Bier!–auf unter zehn Liter im letzten Jahr. Und seit vier Jahren nimmt überraschenderweise auch kontinuierlich der Alkoholkonsum bei Jugendlichen ab, bei (gefühlt) zunehmender Frequenz des Themas “Komasaufen” in Boulevard und Politik.\n\nProst!\n\n_Links zum Thema:_\n\n- [Datenblatt der WHO](http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/profiles/deu.pdf) (PDF, englisch)\n- Artikel auf [ZEIT.de: “Mythos Rausch”](http://www.zeit.de/campus/2013/02/leben-rausch/komplettansicht)\n\n- Artikel auf [Gesundheit - Zahlen, Daten, Fakten: “Wie viele Jugendliche trinken Alkohol?”](http://gesundheit-zahlen-daten-fakten.blogspot.de/2012/02/wie-viele-jugendliche-trinken-alkohol.html)\n\n\n[^1]: Die Statistik der WHO rechnet alle Getränke in 100%igen Alkohol um.\n\n\n---\n\n## Zu guter Letzt…\n\n[**Kleinkind dauerhaft von HIV geheilt**](http://science.orf.at/stories/1727077/) — Der Behandlungserfolg bei einem mit HIV zur Welt gekommenen Mädchen lässt hoffen, dass eine frühe Therapie die Vermehrung der Viren bei Neugeborenen verhindern kann. Die Kleine bekam insg. 18 Monate lang antiretrovirale Medikamente, danach traten keine Symptome der Krankheit mehr bei ihr auf. Wegen dieses Überraschungserfolgs startet 2014 in den USA eine durch Bundesmittel geförderte Studie, in deren Zentrum eine solche Therapie für Neugeborene mit HIV-Infektion steht.\n\n[**Retrograde Gentherapie repariert Herz**](http://www.kurzweilai.net/first-use-of-retrograde-gene-therapy-on-a-human-heart) (englisch) — Starke Meldung, u.U. komme ich darauf in einer der nächsten Ausgaben nochmal zurück: in den USA wurde Anfang November ein Patient, dessen Herz nach einem Anfall 2003 nur noch mit halber Kraft lief, mit einer sog. retrograde Gentherapie behandelt. Über einen Katheter (minimal-invasiv!) wurde das Herz mit reiner menschlicher DNA (dem Botenstoff SDF-1) durchspült, die dem Körper signalisiert, dass das Organ repariert werden muss, was die im Körper vorhandenen Stammzellen dann auch tun. Der Mann war während der Operation bei Bewusstsein, konnte kurz danach das Krankenhaus verlassen, und fühlt sich nach eigenem Bekunden _“so gut wie seit Jahren nicht mehr”_. **HOT DAMN.**\n",

Ich gebe mein Bestes, aber wundere Dich bitte nicht, sollte am nächsten Donnerstag kein NadZ in Deiner Mailbox liegen.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"durchbruch-in-der-gentechnik\">Durchbruch in der Gentechnik</h2>\n<p>Bei der sog. Gentherapie handelt es sich um ein Feld in der Gentechnik, bei dem in die Körperzellen eines Patienten Nukleinsäuren (DNA &amp; RNA) eingefügt werden, um Gendefekte oder Krankheiten zu behandeln. Wenn z.B. ein defektes Gen eine Störung oder Krankheit hervorruft, kann es durch eine intakte Version ersetzt werden, um damit die Ursache des Problems zu beheben.</p>\n<p>Soweit zumindest die Theorie. Die gängigste Methode des Einsetzens ist es, modifizierte Viren zu benutzen, die die veränderten Gene in das Erbgut der Zellen einschleusen. Das schaffen die Viren schon—aber wie und wo genau, das entzieht sich unserer Kontrolle, können sie doch nicht 100%ig gesteuert werden. Wird aber das veränderte Gen an der falschen Stelle eingesetzt, so kann es u.U. großen Schaden anrichten. Der Prozess ist also nicht zielgerichtet genug, um ihn überwiegend als “sicher” bezeichnen zu können.</p>\n<p>Auftritt CRISPR-CAS9! Was nach einer Mischung zwischen einem Kellogs-Produkt und einem Spezialkommando der Polizei klingt, ist eine Sensation. CRISPR ( <em>“clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats”</em>) sind in Bakterien vorkommende Abschnitte sich wiederholender DNA; bis vor ein paar Jahren dachte die Wissenschaft noch, dass es sich dabei um sog. “ <em>junk</em>” (engl., “Müll”), also überflüssige DNA, handelt. Im Jahr 2007 stellte man dann fest, dass diese Teile der DNA tatsächlich zu einem cleveren Abwehrmechanismus gehören, mit dem die Bakterien Viren bekämpfen und Immunitäten aufbauen. Wenn die Bakterien mit Hilfe der Information in diesen Abschnitten einen Angreifer erkennen, setzen ihn ausser Gefecht, indem sie dessen DNA-Moleküle mit Hilfe von Enzymen kleinschneiden.</p>\n<p>Zwei Wissenschafterinnen, Prof. Jennifer Doudna (UC Berkeley, USA) und Prof. Emmanuelle Charpentier (Umea University, Sweden), haben darauf basierend zusammen in den letzten Jahren eine Technik entwickelt, die es erlaubt, DNA punktgenau bearbeiten zu können. Sie bedienen sich dabei eines Enzyms namens CAS9, das sie “programmiert” haben, einen DNA-Strang an exakt vorgegebenen Stellen zu zertrennen. In diese Stellen können dann neue Informationen/Gene eingesetzt werden.</p>\n<p><strong>Ihre Arbeit stellt einen Durchbruch in der Gentechnik dar: sie haben eine Methode gefunden, die DNA in einem komplexen Genom akkurat zu bearbeiten.</strong></p>\n<p>Ihre Technik wurde bereits von mehreren Teams weltweit erfolgreich an den unterschiedlichsten Organismen getestet, von Pflanzen über Fruchtfliegen und Fischen bis hin zu Mäusen, und das Echo war laut und positiv. Der Biochemiker Craig Mello, Nobelpreisträger für Physiologie/Medizin 2006, sagte: <em>“Als ich [die angewandte Technik] in meinem Labor sah, klappte mir die Kinnlade herunter. Ein totaler Anfänger in meinem Labor hat sie erfolgreich eingesetzt.”</em></p>\n<p>Die Möglichkeiten sind in der Tat überwältigend; Prof. Doudnas Team z.B. arbeitet derzeit an möglichen Gentherapien für die Huntington-Erbkrankheiten, die tödlich und bisher nicht heilbar ist. Andere Forscher sprechen bereits über die Veränderung des Gens, das die Erkrankung des Körpers mit HIV zulässt.</p>\n<p>Sicher wirft das neue ethische Fragen auf, und auch einige ältere Diskussionen werden sicher erneut aufgenommen werden. Ja, diese Diskussionen sind wichtig und müssen geführt werden, aber wie auch immer sie ausgehen mögen: der Schritt von der Kürbiskanone zum Scharfschützengewehr ist getan, die Gentechnik entwickelt sich (anders als meine Metaphern) vielversprechend weiter.</p>\n<p><em>Links zum Thema:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Artikel im <em>The Independent</em>: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/the-more-we-looked-into-the-mystery-of-crispr-the-more-interesting-it-seemed-8925328.html\">“The more we looked into the mystery of Crispr, the more interesting it seemed”</a></li>\n<li>Craig Mello im <em>The Independent</em>: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/this-is-a-triumph-of-basic-science-with-huge-implications-crispr-technique-breaks-the-mould-8925323.html\">“This is a triumph of basic science with huge implications.

Aber warum ist das so?</p>\n<p>In embryonalen Stammzellen existiert ein aktives Gen namens Lin28a, dass dafür sorgt, dass beim Kind Haare, Knochen, Knorpel, Haut und andere Weichteile (nach)wachsen. Nach der Geburt stellt es aber nach und nach seine Arbeit ein, und mit Erreichen des Erwachsenenalters ist das Gen dann deaktiviert. Der Frage, was passiert, wenn man dieses “stillgelegte” Gen in älteren Mäusen reaktiviert, sind Forscher vom Boston Children’s Hospital (USA) nachgegangen.</p>\n<p>Das Gen also nahm seine Arbeit wieder auf, und die Selbstheilungskräfte der älteren Tierchen wurden wieder so stark wie bei Jungtieren. Die Mäusekörper reparierten Wunden und Verletzungen ähnlich schnell wie Mäuse im embryonalen Stadium; allerdings reguliert Lin28a nicht die Zellheilung in allen Bereichen des Körpers—während Knorpel, Haut und Haare nachwuchsen, zeigte sich z.B. bei Verletzungen am Herzen keine Besserung.</p>\n<p>Die Bostoner Wissenschaftler stellten fest, dass Lin28a u.A. funktioniert, weil es ein “Tuning” des Metabolismus der Mitochondrien vornimmt (den “Energieerzeugern” der Zellen)—ein Effekt, der auch durch mit etwas pharmakologischer Hilfe von aussen angeschoben werden kann. Das weist ihrer Meinung darauf hin, dass relativ simples “Reinemachen” auf Zellebene ein neuer Ansatz der regenerativen Medizin sein könnte.</p>\n<p>Lin28a existiert in allen komplexen Organismen.</p>\n<p><em>Links zum Thema:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-11/bch-rrh110713.php\">Artikel bei Eurekalert: “Researchers regrow hair, cartilage, bone, soft tissues”</a> (englisch)</li>\n<li>Wikipedia: <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrien\">Mitochondrium</a></li>\n<li>Wikipedia: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIN28\">LIN28</a> (englisch)</li>\n<li>Wikipedia: <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin\">Kevin</a> ;)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"adhoc-übersetzung-per-smartphone\">Adhoc-Übersetzung per Smartphone</h2>\n<p>Schon etwas älter, aber immer noch relativ unbekannt: visuelle Übersetzer-Apps für iPhone &amp; Co.

Ich gebe mein Bestes, aber wundere Dich bitte nicht, sollte am nächsten Donnerstag kein NadZ in Deiner Mailbox liegen.\n\n---\n\n## Durchbruch in der Gentechnik\n\nBei der sog. Gentherapie handelt es sich um ein Feld in der Gentechnik, bei dem in die Körperzellen eines Patienten Nukleinsäuren (DNA & RNA) eingefügt werden, um Gendefekte oder Krankheiten zu behandeln. Wenn z.B. ein defektes Gen eine Störung oder Krankheit hervorruft, kann es durch eine intakte Version ersetzt werden, um damit die Ursache des Problems zu beheben.\n\nSoweit zumindest die Theorie. Die gängigste Methode des Einsetzens ist es, modifizierte Viren zu benutzen, die die veränderten Gene in das Erbgut der Zellen einschleusen. Das schaffen die Viren schon—aber wie und wo genau, das entzieht sich unserer Kontrolle, können sie doch nicht 100%ig gesteuert werden. Wird aber das veränderte Gen an der falschen Stelle eingesetzt, so kann es u.U. großen Schaden anrichten. Der Prozess ist also nicht zielgerichtet genug, um ihn überwiegend als “sicher” bezeichnen zu können.\n\nAuftritt CRISPR-CAS9! Was nach einer Mischung zwischen einem Kellogs-Produkt und einem Spezialkommando der Polizei klingt, ist eine Sensation. CRISPR ( _“clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats”_) sind in Bakterien vorkommende Abschnitte sich wiederholender DNA; bis vor ein paar Jahren dachte die Wissenschaft noch, dass es sich dabei um sog. “ _junk_” (engl., “Müll”), also überflüssige DNA, handelt. Im Jahr 2007 stellte man dann fest, dass diese Teile der DNA tatsächlich zu einem cleveren Abwehrmechanismus gehören, mit dem die Bakterien Viren bekämpfen und Immunitäten aufbauen. Wenn die Bakterien mit Hilfe der Information in diesen Abschnitten einen Angreifer erkennen, setzen ihn ausser Gefecht, indem sie dessen DNA-Moleküle mit Hilfe von Enzymen kleinschneiden.\n\nZwei Wissenschafterinnen, Prof. Jennifer Doudna (UC Berkeley, USA) und Prof. Emmanuelle Charpentier (Umea University, Sweden), haben darauf basierend zusammen in den letzten Jahren eine Technik entwickelt, die es erlaubt, DNA punktgenau bearbeiten zu können. Sie bedienen sich dabei eines Enzyms namens CAS9, das sie “programmiert” haben, einen DNA-Strang an exakt vorgegebenen Stellen zu zertrennen. In diese Stellen können dann neue Informationen/Gene eingesetzt werden.\n\n**Ihre Arbeit stellt einen Durchbruch in der Gentechnik dar: sie haben eine Methode gefunden, die DNA in einem komplexen Genom akkurat zu bearbeiten.**\n\nIhre Technik wurde bereits von mehreren Teams weltweit erfolgreich an den unterschiedlichsten Organismen getestet, von Pflanzen über Fruchtfliegen und Fischen bis hin zu Mäusen, und das Echo war laut und positiv. Der Biochemiker Craig Mello, Nobelpreisträger für Physiologie/Medizin 2006, sagte: _“Als ich \\[die angewandte Technik\\] in meinem Labor sah, klappte mir die Kinnlade herunter. Ein totaler Anfänger in meinem Labor hat sie erfolgreich eingesetzt.”_\n\nDie Möglichkeiten sind in der Tat überwältigend; Prof. Doudnas Team z.B. arbeitet derzeit an möglichen Gentherapien für die Huntington-Erbkrankheiten, die tödlich und bisher nicht heilbar ist. Andere Forscher sprechen bereits über die Veränderung des Gens, das die Erkrankung des Körpers mit HIV zulässt.\n\nSicher wirft das neue ethische Fragen auf, und auch einige ältere Diskussionen werden sicher erneut aufgenommen werden. Ja, diese Diskussionen sind wichtig und müssen geführt werden, aber wie auch immer sie ausgehen mögen: der Schritt von der Kürbiskanone zum Scharfschützengewehr ist getan, die Gentechnik entwickelt sich (anders als meine Metaphern) vielversprechend weiter.\n\n_Links zum Thema:_\n\n- Artikel im _The Independent_: [“The more we looked into the mystery of Crispr, the more interesting it seemed”](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/the-more-we-looked-into-the-mystery-of-crispr-the-more-interesting-it-seemed-8925328.html)\n- Craig Mello im _The Independent_: [“This is a triumph of basic science with huge implications.

Aber warum ist das so?\n\nIn embryonalen Stammzellen existiert ein aktives Gen namens Lin28a, dass dafür sorgt, dass beim Kind Haare, Knochen, Knorpel, Haut und andere Weichteile (nach)wachsen. Nach der Geburt stellt es aber nach und nach seine Arbeit ein, und mit Erreichen des Erwachsenenalters ist das Gen dann deaktiviert. Der Frage, was passiert, wenn man dieses “stillgelegte” Gen in älteren Mäusen reaktiviert, sind Forscher vom Boston Children’s Hospital (USA) nachgegangen.\n\nDas Gen also nahm seine Arbeit wieder auf, und die Selbstheilungskräfte der älteren Tierchen wurden wieder so stark wie bei Jungtieren. Die Mäusekörper reparierten Wunden und Verletzungen ähnlich schnell wie Mäuse im embryonalen Stadium; allerdings reguliert Lin28a nicht die Zellheilung in allen Bereichen des Körpers—während Knorpel, Haut und Haare nachwuchsen, zeigte sich z.B. bei Verletzungen am Herzen keine Besserung.\n\nDie Bostoner Wissenschaftler stellten fest, dass Lin28a u.A. funktioniert, weil es ein “Tuning” des Metabolismus der Mitochondrien vornimmt (den “Energieerzeugern” der Zellen)—ein Effekt, der auch durch mit etwas pharmakologischer Hilfe von aussen angeschoben werden kann. Das weist ihrer Meinung darauf hin, dass relativ simples “Reinemachen” auf Zellebene ein neuer Ansatz der regenerativen Medizin sein könnte.\n\nLin28a existiert in allen komplexen Organismen.\n\n_Links zum Thema:_\n\n- [Artikel bei Eurekalert: “Researchers regrow hair, cartilage, bone, soft tissues”](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-11/bch-rrh110713.php) (englisch)\n- Wikipedia: [Mitochondrium](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrien)\n- Wikipedia: [LIN28](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIN28) (englisch)\n- Wikipedia: [Kevin](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin) ;)\n\n---\n\n## Adhoc-Übersetzung per Smartphone\n\nSchon etwas älter, aber immer noch relativ unbekannt: visuelle Übersetzer-Apps für iPhone & Co. Stell Dir vor, Du bist im fremdsprachigen Ausland unterwegs und stolperst über Schilder, die Du nicht lesen kannst. Du könntest Dein Wörterbuch zücken und nachschlagen, oder aber die _Word Lens_-App der Firma Quest Visual auf Deinem Smartphone starten, die Kamera auf das Schild richten, und die Übersetzung im Display ablesen—der Text im echten Schild wird dabei mit die Übersetzung ersetzt. Klingt irre, ist es auch. (Schau Dir das kurze Video auf der Website von Quest Visual an!)\n\nIch mag die App, weil die Idee dahinter klasse ist: sie löst ein Problem, das jeder kennen dürfte, der hin und wieder verreist. Es nutzt die Technologie, die wir ohnehin mit uns rumtragen, um Reisenden das Leben zu vereinfachen. Sicher, die App ist nicht perfekt, und die Auswahl an Sprachen ist (für deutschsprachige Nutzer) dürftig, aber das tut der Sache keinen Abbruch. Ganz ehrlich, wir sind an dem Punkt angekommen, wo ich es fast als Downgrade empfinden würde, wenn mir jemand einen funktionieren _Star Trek_-Tricorder im Austausch mit meinem iPhone anbieten würde. ;) Dieses kleine, flache, schwarze Ding aus Glas und Metall, das ich immer in meiner Hosentasche bei mir habe, es hat sehr wahrscheinlich mehr Rechenpower als alles, was die NASA vor 30-40 Jahren aufbieten konnte.\n\nDas wird mir hin und wieder klar, und dann muss ich lachen.\n\nPS: Wer einfach nur ein Tool für Spracherkennung-Übersetzung-Sprachausgabe sucht, dem sei die _Google Translate_-App ans Herz gelegt. Auf deutsch reinsprechen, das Smartphone liest die Übersetzung vor.\n\n_Links zum Thema:_\n\n- [Website von Quest Visual](http://questvisual.com/de/)\n- Google Translate [für iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/google-translate/id414706506) und [für Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate&hl=de)\n\n---\n\n## Zu guter Letzt…\n\n[**Tesla Motors investiert stark in Deutschland**](http://youtu.be/CdE9o51_P_4) (Video, 10:24 min, englisch) — Tesla-Chef Elon Musk war vor drei Wochen in München, um ein Servicecenter für [Tesla’s elektrische Fahrzeuge](http://www.teslamotors.com/de_DE/) einzuweihen. Dort verriet er den Fahrplan für Deutschland: bis Ende 2014 wird jeder Deutsche (ohne umziehen zu müssen!) in Reichweite einer ihrer [Supercharger-Station](http://www.teslamotors.com/de_DE/supercharger) wohnen, die einen Tesla innerhalb von 30-40 min wieder aufladen können. Ich hatte ja gehofft, dass wir bald **eine umfassende Abdeckung an elektrischen Auto-Ladestationen** sehen werden—nur hätte ich nicht geglaubt, dass es eine amerikanische Firma sein würde, die dieses Projekt hier im Land des Automobilbaus angeht. LOL@you, Volkswagen, BMW & Mercedes. Aber in aller Fairness muss man auch zugeben, dass nur Tesla es ernst meint mit den elektrischen Fahrzeugen.\n\n[**Pränatale Diagnose ohne Fruchtwasseruntersuchung**](http://singularityhub.com/2013/11/13/fetal-dna-sequencing-experiencing-revolution-with-new-non-invasive-testing-goodbye-amnio/) (englisch) — Das US-Unternehmen Illumina, Inc. hat [eine Methode zur Frühdiagnostik](http://investor.illumina.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=121127&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1871236&highlight=) von Ungeborenen entwickelt, mit dem genetische Defekte festgestellt werden können, ohne dass die Mütter sich einer Fruchtwasseruntersuchung unterziehen müssen. Dabei wird aus einer Blutprobe der Mutter die fötale DNA des Kindes extrahiert, die dann untersucht werden kann. Der non-invasive Test hat eine sehr hohe Genauigkeit und verringert das Risiko für Mutter und Kind gegenüber herkömmlichen Untersuchungen. Kalifornien hat der Methode schon die staatliche Zulassung erteilt.\n\n[**Autonome Fahrzeuge im öffentlichen Nahverkehr**](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/07/driverless-cars-coming-to-milton-keynes) (englisch) — Die britische Stadt Milton Keynes wird ab 2015 selbstfahrende elektrische Automobile im ÖPNV einsetzen. Die kleinen “Pods” haben Platz für je 2 Personen und decken einen (kleinen) Teil der Stadt ab; anfangs sollen 20 Fahrzeuge eingesetzt werden, bis Mitte 2017 soll die Flotte dann auf 100 Pods anwachsen, und ein größeres Gebiet versorgen. Randnotiz: Die meisten der großen Autohersteller arbeiten mittlerweile an selbstfahrenden Autos, über das Thema werden wir in den nächsten Jahren noch mehr hören.\n",

Der Sensor registrierte diese in Tierversuchen; einmal eingesetzt funktionierte er für ca. 400 Tage.\n\nKohlenstoffnanoröhren sind in den Augen vieler Wissenschaftler von großem Interesse beim Einsatz in Sensoren. Die hohlen, nur einen Nanometer dünnen Zylinder aus reinem Kohlenstoff wurden im MIT-Labor benutzt, um durch das Vorhandensein unterschiedlicher Moleküle unterschiedliche Stoffe nachzuweisen, wie z.B. Oxidationsmittel wie Wasserstoffperoxid, toxische Substanzen wie Saringas, oder eben auch Stickstoffmonoxid. Die Röhrchen besitzen eine natürliche Fluoreszenz; wenn sie mit einem Molekül gekoppelt werden, das ein bestimmtes anderes Molekül “aufspüren” kann, verändert sich die Fluoreszenz. Wenn der unter der Haut befindliche Sensor dann mit einem Nah-Infrarot-Laser angepeilt wird, kann der Grad der Fluoreszenz ausgelesen werden—der Sensor gibt damit seine Messdaten preis.\n\nDiese Meldung gefällt mir, weil sie ein gutes Bild davon zeichnet, wie die neue Generation von Sensoren aussieht bzw. aussehen wird: ohne Kabel, Batterien und Elektroden, die in den Körper gesteckt werden, dafür mit Nanotechnologie und Licht. Im Moment z.B. arbeitet das Team vom MIT daran, ihre Technologie für Glukose-Nanosensoren zu adaptieren—Diabetiker dürfen bei Gelingen auf eine Zukunft ohne Blutglukose-Messung durch Stich in die Fingerkuppe hoffen.\n\nAllerdings vermute ich, dass es noch ein paar Wochen dauern wird, bis Nanosensoren bei unseren Hausärzten ankommen werden. Egal! Ich harre aus.\n\n_Links zum Thema:_\n\n- [Artikel: “New implantable sensor paves way to long-term monitoring” auf MITnews](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/new-implantable-sensor-1103.html) (englisch)\n- [Wikipedia: Kohlenstoffnanoröhre](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohlenstoffnanor%C3%B6hre)\n\n---\n\n## Zu guter Letzt…\n\n[**Erfolgreichen Quantenteleportation**](http://www.uni-mainz.de/presse/57277.php) — Im August verkündete die Uni Mainz, dass sie _“photonische Quantenbits außerordentlich zuverlässig”_ teleportiert und damit einen großen Schritt Richtung Quanten-Kommunikation und -Computer gemacht haben. (Schnell, jemand muss einen _“Scotty, beam’ mich rauf”_-Witz machen.)\n\n[**Biohacker-Projekt der Woche: Subdermaler NFC-Chip**](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-xnt-implantable-nfc-chip) (englisch) — Wer [_Near Field Communication_](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Field_Communication) mag (“Nahfeldkommunikation”, eine drahtlose Form der Datenübertragung zwischen Geräten, die nur wenige Zentimeter voneinander entfernt sind), sollte sich dieses Crowdfunding-Projekt anschauen: für nur $99 kann man einen reiskorngroßen NFC-Chip kaufen, der dazu gedacht ist, unter die Haut transplantiert zu werden. Der Chip kann frei programmiert werden, und benutzt werden, um z.B. das hauseigene NFC-verkabelte Türschloss zu öffnen. Ich persönlich finde es cool, habe aber selbst leider (?) keine Anwendung dafür. Wenn Du an dem Projekt teilnehmen solltest, lass es mich wissen! :)\n\n[**NASA und Partner entwickeln ein sicheres Sonnensystem-Internet**](http://moonandback.com/2013/11/03/nasa-and-partners-developing-a-secure-solar-system-internet/) (englisch) — Die NASA hat die Entwicklung an technologischen Konzepten für sichere, fehlertolerante Softwaresysteme für Sonnensystem-weite Kommunikation begonnen. Schliesslich müssen wir auch noch irgendwie vernünftig mit der Erde telefonieren können, wenn wir auf unseren Ferienasteroiden im Saturn-Orbit sind.\n\n[**Do-It-Yourself-Cyborg**](http://youtu.be/FGSo_I86_lQ) (Video, englisch, 2:56 min)— Vater baut im Alleingang eine mechanische Hand für seinen Sohn, der ohne Finger auf die Welt kam. Die Pläne dafür fand er im Internet, wo sie von anderen Bastlern frei zur Verfügung gestellt wurden. Gefertigt hat er sie daheim, im 3D-Drucker. Und zusammen mit seinem Sohn arbeitet er an neuen Designs. Der Drucker kostete ihn zwischen $1000 und $2000, aber das eigentliche Material für die Hand? Nur $10. FUCK YEAH.\n",

Ich habe den Begriff schon des Öfteren an dieser Stelle verwendet, wenn ich von neuen Raumfahrt-Unternehmen spreche. Für die Erklärung muss ich aber kurz etwas ausholen.</p>\n<p><strong>Der Wettlauf ins All</strong> begann, als die Sowjetunion 1957 den ersten künstlichen Satelliten— <em>Sputnik</em>—ins den Weltraum schickten; die USA hatte sich von dem Schock noch nicht komplett erholt, da legte die SU nach und sandte 1961 den Fliegeroffizier Juri Gagarin in den Erdorbit. Selbstverständlich konnten sich die Vereinigten Staaten nicht so einfach die historisch bedeutsame Butter vom Brot der Menschheitsgeschichte nehmen lassen, und so bezwangen sie heroisch das nervöse Zucken in ihren Augen und beendeten 1969 mit der <em>Apollo 11</em>-Mission das Rennen zum Mond (und damit den Wettlauf).</p>\n<p>Das war vor gut vier Jahrzehnten; damals gingen viele Menschen davon aus, dass das goldene Zeitalter in der Raumfahrt eingeläutet sei—nächster Halt: Mars! Doch weit gefehlt. Zwar sahen die nächsten drei Jahrzehnte die russische Raumstation <em>Mir</em>, das amerikanische <em>Space Shuttle</em>-Programm und die ISS; aber abgesehen von einer überschaubaren Anzahl von Sonden, die in unserem Auftrag im Sonnensystem unterwegs sind, sind wir doch auf der Erde und im erdnahen Orbit geblieben. Denn die einzigen Spieler auf dem Feld der Raumfahrt, die sich derlei Projekte leisten konnten, waren Regierungen/Staaten, die aus unterschiedlichen Gründen nicht mehr bereit waren, die Summen zu investieren, die uns weiter vorangebracht hätten. Dazu kam, dass die meisten wissenschaftlichen Großprojekte länger als eine Legislaturperiode dauern, und mehr als ein Regierungswechsel beendete vielversprechende und bereits laufende Projekte vorzeitig.</p>\n<p><strong>Die Jahrtausendwende sah dann eine interessante Entwicklung:</strong> die Menschheit hatte sich technologisch endlich so weit entwickelt, dass kommerzielle Raumfahrt-Ansätze in greifbare Nähe rückten. Gleichzeitig wurde klar, dass die staatlichen Agenturen (NASA, Roskosmos, ESA etc.) über die Jahre hinweg lethargisch geworden waren—genau das, was früher für Beständigkeit, Mittel und Möglichkeiten gesorgt hatte, wurde plötzlich zum Bremsklotz; ausufernde Bürokratie, interne Lagerbildung, die Bindung an ihre Staaten und deren wirtschaftliche Situation halfen nicht.</p>\n<p>Der freie Markt witterte Morgenluft, und es entstanden einige Firmen, deren Ziel es war (und ist), den Weltraum zu erreichen, auch ohne die Technik der NASA &amp; Co., und das kostengünstiger, effizienter, in schnelleren Entwicklungszyklen.</p>\n<p>Aber auch die nichtkommerzielle Weltraumgemeinde bekam endlich die Möglichkeit, in einem vertretbaren finanziellen Rahmen dem Ort ihres Interesses näherzukommen—in Form von selbstentwickelten Raketen, unbemannten Stratosphären-Ballons mit Kameras und Sensoren, etc.—und/oder zielgerichtete Projekte mit Rat, Tat und Crowdfunding zu unterstützen.</p>\n<p>All diese Initiativen (mit all ihren unterschiedlichen Zielen) und ihre zugrundeliegende Philosophie sind das, was man in dem Begriff “NewSpace” zusammenfasst. Eine <em>kurze</em> Liste von Beispielen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Space Exploration Technologies Corp.</strong> (SpaceX) entwickelt Launch-System und Raumfähren. SpaceX arbeitet an wiederverwendbaren Raketen (siehe NadZ #2, <em>“Wirtschaftlichkeit… IN SPACE”</em>), versorgt die ISS aktiv mit Gütern, und wird bald auch Astronauten zur ISS befördern (im Rahmen eines Vertrages mit der NASA). SpaceX’ erklärtes Ziel ist es, die Besiedlung anderer Planeten zu ermöglichen. Wie drückte es Elon Musk, NewSpace-Pionier und SpaceX-Gründer, so treffend aus? <em>“Ich würde gern auf dem Mars sterben, nur halt nicht beim Aufprall.”</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bigelow Aerospace</strong> baut aufblasbare Habitatmodule für den Einsatz im Weltraum. Die Module werden platzsparend transportiert, und entfalten sich an ihrem Einsatzort auf ein Vielfaches ihrer Größe. Die ersten Starts fanden 2006 und 2007 statt; Mitte 2015 wird ein solches “Bigelow Expandable Activity Module” (BEAM) an der ISS angedockt und getestet. Die Firma arbeitet an einer privaten Raumstation, deren Module 2016 fertig für ihren Einsatz im Orbit sein soll, und die Bigelow an Firmen, Länder und Privatpersonen vermieten will.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Final Frontier Designs</strong> hat sich auf die Entwicklung von neuen Raumanzügen spezialisiert, die Astronauten im Schiff bzw. in der Station tragen. FFD hatte 2012 ein erfolgreiches Kickstarter-Projekt am Start, um einen Prototypen fertigstellen zu können. Die Firma ist ein gutes Beispiel für die aufblühende NewSpace-Zulieferindustrie: sie wollen ihre Anzüge für $50.000/Stück verkaufen—die derzeit von der NASA entwickelten und eingesetzten Modelle kosten das Fünffache.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Copenhagen Suborbitals</strong> erwähnte ich in NadZ #3 schon einmal (“Zu guter Letzt… → Dänemark hat ein Raumfahrtprogramm!”). Die Dänen benutzen handelsübliche Materialien für ihre Raketen und Geräte, und starten von einem schwimmenden Ponton in internationalen Gewässern aus. Sie zeigen gut, wie sehr Technologie zur Demokratisierung der Raumfahrt beiträgt—sie ist nicht mehr zwangsläufig nur das Metier von Staaten und Großkonzernen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cubesats</strong> sind keine Firma, sondern miniaturisierte Satelliten, deren standardisierte Größe zwischen 10×10×10cm und 30×10×10cm liegt. Aufgrund ihrer Größe sind die Geräte nicht so wahnsinnig leistungsfähig, allerdings war die ursprüngliche Grundidee auch, Studenten halbwegs kostengünstig die Möglichkeit zu geben, ihre Experimente ins All zu bringen—Mission erfolgreich erfüllt! Die meisten Cubesats beschränken sich daher auf wissenschaftliche Aufgaben, jedoch gibt es auch kommerzielle Versionen. Sie werden gruppenweise ins All befördert, in den letzten 10 Jahren ist die Zahl der Würfel im aktiven Einsatz auf ca. 80 gewachsen. Die Firma <strong>Interorbital Systems</strong> hat gerade stolz zwei ausgebuchte Missionen für das Jahr 2014 verkündet: sie werden allein im nächsten Jahr über 60 neue Cubesats ins All transportieren.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Planetary Resources</strong>’ langfristiges Ziel ist der Erz- und Eisabbau auf/an/in Asteroiden. Derzeit arbeiten die Firma an ihrem ersten ARKYD-Satelliten—einem (auch) durch Crowdfunding finanzierten Weltraumteleskop, das nach dem Launch auch Bildungseinrichtungen zur Verfügung gestellt werden soll. Unter den Beratern und Investoren finden sich bekannte Gesichter wie Larry Page &amp; Eric Schmidt (Google), Sir Richard Branson (Virgin) und James Cameron (Filmemacher).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nach Jahrzehnten der Stagnation und des Dahinsiechens ist endlich, endlich wieder Bewegung in die Raumfahrt gekommen; meine Liste ist keineswegs umfassend! Es gibt Firmen, die an der Technologie für Weltraumlifte arbeiten (z.B. LiftPort), Firmen, die suborbitalen Tourismus betreiben wollen/werden (z.B. Virgin Galactic) und Firmen, die den Mond als Basis oder Rohstofflieferanten im Visier haben (z.B. Golden Spike Company oder Shackleton Energy Company), und noch einige mehr. Und ja, das Meiste klingt noch nach SciFi, aber viele dieser Projekte sind schon aus der Planungsphase heraus—an ihnen wird aktiv gearbeitet. Werden sie von Erfolg gekrönt sein? Keine Ahnung. :)</p>\n<p><strong>Mich stimmt das alles sehr fröhlich.</strong> Mal vom Zugang zum All und meiner Begeisterung für Raumfahrt an sich abgesehen: viele große Erfindungen der Neuzeit sind “Abfallprodukte” der Weltraumforschung, darunter kratzfeste Brillengläser, moderne Herzschrittmacher, Satelliten-gestützte Kommunikation und Insulinpumpen.

All dieses Zeug kam zu einer Zeit aus den NASA-Laboren, als die meisten Menschen noch in Höhlen wohnten und mit Kohle Bilder an die Decke kratzten (ca. 1965-1985)—dementsprechend freue ich mich auf den heissen Scheiss[^1], der jetzt gerade in der NewSpace-Bewegung entsteht und noch entstehen wird, und unsere Welt(en) und unseren Alltag verändern werden.\n\n_Links zum Thema:_\n\n- [Wikipedia: Wettlauf ins All](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wettlauf_ins_All)\n- [Wikipedia: NewSpace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewSpace) (englisch)\n\n- [Wikipedia: List of private spaceflight companies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_private_spaceflight_companies) (englisch)\n\n- [Wikipedia: Cubesats](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat)\n\n- [Firmenwebsite: SpaceX](http://www.spacex.com/) (englisch)\n\n- [Firmenwebsite: Bigelow Aerospace](http://www.bigelowaerospace.com/) (englisch)\n\n- [Firmenwebsite: Final Frontier Design](http://www.finalfrontierdesign.com/) (englisch)\n\n- [Interorbital Systems](http://www.interorbital.com/) (englisch)\n\n- [Firmenwebsite: Copenhagen Suborbitals](http://www.copenhagensuborbitals.com/) (englisch)\n\n- [Firmenwebsite: Planetary Resources](http://www.planetaryresources.com/) (englisch)\n\n- [Kickstarter-Video zu Planetary Resource’s ARKYD-Satelliten](http://www.youtube.com/v/uzM18tiR5B0?cc_load_policy=1&hl=de&autoplay=1) (deutsche Untertitel, 4:19 min)\n\n- [Kickstarter: Final Frontier Design’s Raumanzug-Projekt](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/872281861/final-frontier-designs-3g-space-suit) (englisch)\n\n- [Artikel zu Bigelow Aerospace in der Washington Post: “International space station to receive inflatable module”](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/international-space-station-to-receive-inflatable-module/2013/01/16/8a102712-5ffc-11e2-9940-6fc488f3fecd_story.html) (englisch)\n\n- [Artikel bei Heise: “Mit NewSpace zur neuen NASA”](http://www.heise.de/tr/artikel/Mit-NewSpace-zur-neuen-NASA-1016200.html) (Artikel von 2010)\n\n- [Artikel zu Copenhagen Suborbitals in der WirtschaftsWoche:”Amateur-Rakete aus dem Baumarkt fliegt 8000 Meter hoch”](http://www.wiwo.de/technologie/forschung/sternstunde-test-geglueckt-amateur-rakete-aus-dem-baumarkt-fliegt-8000-meter-hoch/8401344.html)\n\n- [Neues aus der Zukunft #2](/issues/2-ausgabe-2)\n\n- [Neues aus der Zukunft #3](/issues/3-ausgabe-3)\n\n[^1]: Der Begriff wurde von den Moderatoren auf Radio Fritz benutzt, ist also m.E. journalistisch wertvoll.\n\n---\n\n## Häuser aus dem Drucker\n\nProf. Behrokh Khoshnevis von der University of Southern California entwickelt hausgroße Roboter-Drucker, die nicht Kunststoffe, sondern Beton-Faser-Gemische verwenden, und Schicht für Schicht stabile Wände hochziehen. Sein Team präsentierte schon im letzten Jahr Prototypen, die 2m hohe Wände druckten—gerade und geschwungene.\n\nLaut Khoshnevis könnte mit dieser Technik ein Haus mit einer Grundfläche von ~230m2 in weniger als 24 Stunden fertiggestellt werden. (Sie ist aber noch nicht 100%ig serienreif.) Er gibt als Einsatzgebiete u.A. den sozialen Hausbau an sowie die automatisierte Errichtung von Habitaten auf anderen Planeten. In seiner Präsentation zeigte er Slums und katastrophale Behelfsunterkünfte und wies darauf hin, dass derzeit immer noch über 1 Milliarde Menschen in solch unwürdigen Zuständen leben muss. Mit Hilfe des _Contour Crafting_, wie er seine Technologie nennt, könnten ausreichend kostengünstige Häuser errichtet werden, und das weitaus schneller und Rohstoff-sparender, als es bisher möglich ist.\n\nEine deutschsprachige Kurzzusammenfassung gibts [bei Wikipedia](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_Crafting).\n\n_Links zum Thema:_\n\n- [Contour Crafting](http://www.contourcrafting.org/) (englisch)\n- [TEDx-Präsentation von Prof. Khoshnevis](http://youtu.be/JdbJP8Gxqog) (englisch)\n\n---\n\n## Photonische Prozessoren\n\nWissenschaftler an der Universität von Colorado, dem MIT und Technology Inc. haben zusammen Chips entwickelt, die auf Silizium basieren, aber photonisch arbeiten, also mit Licht. Ihre Mikroprozessoren nutzen Licht statt elektrischer Ströme, um intern zu kommunizieren, und schliessen dadurch viele Probleme aus, die bei der weiteren Miniaturisierung von Schaltkreisen auftreten. Die elektrischen Leiter fangen irgendwann an, sich gegenseitig negativ zu beeinflussen, wenn sie zu fein werden und zu nah beieinander liegen.\n\nEine der Besonderheiten der neuentwickelten Technik ist, dass diese Chips mit bereits existierenden Fertigungssystemen hergestellt werden können; eine andere, dass sie energiesparender arbeiten als ihre rein elektronischen Vorgänger. Die Forscher hoffen, dass ihre neue Technik innerhalb von 5 Jahren marktreif ist.\n\n_Links zum Thema:_\n\n- [Pressemitteilung](http://www.colorado.edu/news/features/cu-mit-breakthrough-photonics-could-allow-faster-and-faster-electronics) (englisch)\n- [Ausführlicherer Artikel auf EL-Info](http://www.elektronikinformationen.de/index.php?id=166&artid=33541&titel=durchbruch-in-der-photonik-oeffnet-wege-zu-weitaus-schnelleren-mikroprozessoren)\n",

BD ging 1992 aus dem Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) hervor. Sie ist <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/16r6VH5\">DARPA</a>-finanziert und hat mehrere unglaublich coole Projekte am Start.</p>\n<p>Ich wurde vor ein paar Jahren auf Boston Dynamics aufmerksam, als Videos ihres vierbeinigen BigDog-Roboters die Runde machten, die seine Reflexe zeigten ( <a href=\"http://youtu.be/3gi6Ohnp9x8\">beeindruckendes/heiteres Video</a>, 2:12 min). BigDog wird primär fürs Militär entwickelt; sein aktueller Nachfolger LS3 ( <em>“Legged Squad Support System”</em>) ist ein Lastenträger für unwegsames Gelände, der überall dort hingehen kann, wo auch Marines und Soldaten zu Fuß hinkommen—Steigungen, Geröll, matschige Wege, Schnee und Wasser inklusive. ( <a href=\"http://youtu.be/R7ezXBEBE6U\">Tolles Video aus dem Gelände</a>, 1:30 min.) LS3 wertet das vor ihm liegende Terrain aus, um seinem Führer automatisch zu folgen, und kann bei Bedarf auch selbständig GPS-Koordinaten ansteuern. Er schleppt bis zu 180 kg, der eingebaute Verbrennungsmotor hat genug Treibstoff für 24h bzw. 32 km.</p>\n<p>Neben BigDog arbeitet die Firma noch an anderen interessanten Projekten, u.A. an…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dem humanoiden <a href=\"http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_Atlas.html\">Atlas</a> (irres <a href=\"http://youtu.be/SD6Okylclb8\">Video von Atlas auf Geröll</a>, 1:04 min)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_rhex.html\">RHex</a>, einem sechsbeinigen Aufklärer ( <a href=\"http://youtu.be/ISznqY3kESI\">Video</a>, 1:53 min)</li>\n<li>dem Kletterer <a href=\"http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_rise.html\">Rise</a>, der Wände und Bäume bezwingt ( <a href=\"http://youtu.be/MZGGL20g99A\">Video</a>, 1:28 min)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Boston Dynamics’ neueste Kreation ist der Vierbeiner WildCat, der diverse Untergründe schnell bezwingen kann. Seine momentane Höchstgeschwindigkeit ist 25 km/h—das <a href=\"http://youtu.be/wE3fmFTtP9g\">sehr coole Vorstellungsvideo</a> (2:09 min) sagt mir, dass mein Kindheitstraum nicht so abwegig war: WildCat + Sattel = Roboterpony!

Als Ergebnis werden neue Erkenntnisse über das menschliche Hirn und seine Erkrankungen sowie neue Computer- und Robotertechnologien erwartet.

Es wird in den nächsten 2,5 Jahren sechs Forschungsplattformen entwickeln, die in die Bereiche der Neuroinformatik, Neurorobotik, Hirnsimulation, Supercomputer, medizinische Informatik und <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorph\">neuromorphe Computer</a> fallen.

Wir werden Krankheiten besser verstehen und bekämpfen können, denn die medizinische Diagnostik und Hirnforschung kann beim HBP nur gewinnen. Und dank des besseren Verständnisses der Arbeitsweise des Hirns werden sich Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien rasant weiterentwickeln—sehr wahrscheinlich sehen wir in ein paar Jahren neuronale Chips, eventuell bessere Hirn/Computer-Schnittstellen, möglicherweise smartere Roboter usw.</p>\n<p>The mind boggles.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"bakterien-minizoo\">Bakterien-Minizoo</h2>\n<p>Forschern aus Austin, Texas, ist es gelungen, <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/1b8nwPA\">mikroskopisch kleine Minikäfige für Bakterien herzustellen</a>.

				"content_text": "Ja, servus!\n\nDie letzte Woche hatte einige supergute Nachrichten parat. Erstens hat die Wiesn endlich geendet (i.e. das Oktoberfest), und München ist nicht mehr im Ausnahmezustand. Und zweitens habe ich wieder viele interessante Sachen entdeckt und gelesen, und bin dabei extrem ins Schwärmen gekommen—die vollen Artikel in dieser Ausgabe sind deshalb etwas länger als gewohnt. Dafür gibts diesmal auch nur vier davon; als Ausgleich habe ich noch 5 Kurzmeldungen draufgelegt (“Zu guter Letzt…”). Ich hoffe, es gefällt Dir. Wenn nicht, weil zu lang / zu kurz / zu kompliziert / zu einfach / zu doof / etc., [schreib mir eine Mail](mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de)! Ich freue mich ehrlich über Feedback!\n\nUnd wenn Dir diese Ausgabe gefällt, empfiehl sie bitte weiter oder teile sie auf Twitter, Facebook oder Google+ (die Links dazu findest Du am Ende der Mail).\n\nBis nächste Woche,\n\n—Carlo.\n\n---\n\n## Dynamisches aus Boston\n\n[Boston Dynamics](http://www.bostondynamics.com/) ist eine Firma in den USA, die sich mit Robotik beschäftigt, speziell damit, Robotern das Laufen beizubringen und sie mobiler zu machen. BD ging 1992 aus dem Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) hervor. Sie ist [DARPA](http://zukun.tf/16r6VH5)-finanziert und hat mehrere unglaublich coole Projekte am Start.\n\nIch wurde vor ein paar Jahren auf Boston Dynamics aufmerksam, als Videos ihres vierbeinigen BigDog-Roboters die Runde machten, die seine Reflexe zeigten ( [beeindruckendes/heiteres Video](http://youtu.be/3gi6Ohnp9x8), 2:12 min). BigDog wird primär fürs Militär entwickelt; sein aktueller Nachfolger LS3 ( _“Legged Squad Support System”_) ist ein Lastenträger für unwegsames Gelände, der überall dort hingehen kann, wo auch Marines und Soldaten zu Fuß hinkommen—Steigungen, Geröll, matschige Wege, Schnee und Wasser inklusive. ( [Tolles Video aus dem Gelände](http://youtu.be/R7ezXBEBE6U), 1:30 min.) LS3 wertet das vor ihm liegende Terrain aus, um seinem Führer automatisch zu folgen, und kann bei Bedarf auch selbständig GPS-Koordinaten ansteuern. Er schleppt bis zu 180 kg, der eingebaute Verbrennungsmotor hat genug Treibstoff für 24h bzw. 32 km.\n\nNeben BigDog arbeitet die Firma noch an anderen interessanten Projekten, u.A. an…\n\n- dem humanoiden [Atlas](http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_Atlas.html) (irres [Video von Atlas auf Geröll](http://youtu.be/SD6Okylclb8), 1:04 min)\n- [RHex](http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_rhex.html), einem sechsbeinigen Aufklärer ( [Video](http://youtu.be/ISznqY3kESI), 1:53 min)\n- dem Kletterer [Rise](http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_rise.html), der Wände und Bäume bezwingt ( [Video](http://youtu.be/MZGGL20g99A), 1:28 min)\n\n\nBoston Dynamics’ neueste Kreation ist der Vierbeiner WildCat, der diverse Untergründe schnell bezwingen kann. Seine momentane Höchstgeschwindigkeit ist 25 km/h—das [sehr coole Vorstellungsvideo](http://youtu.be/wE3fmFTtP9g) (2:09 min) sagt mir, dass mein Kindheitstraum nicht so abwegig war: WildCat + Sattel = Roboterpony! Und auch, dass wir in ein paar Jahren wahrscheinlich hochmobile robotische Helfer im Katastrophenschutz sehen werden, und der Industrie, und und und…\n\nIch gebe zu, die “freilaufenden” Maschinen klingen derzeit noch wie [Fichtenmopeds](http://derstandard.at/2131890/Fichtenmoped) und sind wenig elegant. Aber das wird nicht so bleiben, und neue Antriebs- und Batterietechniken werden früher oder später auch Anwendung in diesem Feld finden.\n\n---\n\n## Startschuss fürs Human Brain Project!\n\nDiese Woche sah den offiziellen Beginn eines der für mich vielversprechendsten Projekte in der Menschheitsgeschichte: das [_Human Brain Project_](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/) (kurz HBP). [Wikipedia beschreibt es](http://zukun.tf/19atpfS) kurz und bündig so:\n\n> Das Human Brain Project ist ein Großprojekt der Europäischen Kommission, welches das gesamte Wissen über **das menschliche Hirn** zusammenfassen und **mittels computerbasierten Modellen und Simulationen nachbilden** soll. Als Ergebnis werden neue Erkenntnisse über das menschliche Hirn und seine Erkrankungen sowie neue Computer- und Robotertechnologien erwartet. \\[…\\] Am Projekt sind über 80 europäische und internationale Forschungseinrichtungen beteiligt. Es ist auf zehn Jahre ausgelegt und soll 1,19 Milliarden Euro kosten.\n\nDas HBP wird seit ca. 1 Jahr vorbereitet, und konzentriert sich auf drei Forschungsfelder: _Future Neuroscience_ (Neurowissenschaften der Zukunft), _Future Medicine_ (Heilkunde der Zukunft) und _Future Computing_ (neues, äh, Komputering?). Es wird in den nächsten 2,5 Jahren sechs Forschungsplattformen entwickeln, die in die Bereiche der Neuroinformatik, Neurorobotik, Hirnsimulation, Supercomputer, medizinische Informatik und [neuromorphe Computer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorph) fallen. Diese Plattformen stehen dann ab 2016 den beteiligten Forschungseinrichtungen zur Verfügung; die Forschungergebnisse werden explizit und aktiv interdisziplinär ausgetauscht.\n\n**Ich glaube, nie zuvor gab es eine derartige koordinierte Initiative zur Erforschung des Hirns.** Wir—als Spezies—wollen endlich detailliert wissen, wie und warum es so gut funktioniert! Und auch wenn noch nicht wirklich absehbar ist, was 2023 unterm Strich herauskommen wird, so kann man doch davon ausgehen, dass das im HBP neu erlangte Wissen viele Felder beflügeln wird.

Und dank des besseren Verständnisses der Arbeitsweise des Hirns werden sich Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien rasant weiterentwickeln—sehr wahrscheinlich sehen wir in ein paar Jahren neuronale Chips, eventuell bessere Hirn/Computer-Schnittstellen, möglicherweise smartere Roboter usw.\n\nThe mind boggles.\n\n---\n\n## Bakterien-Minizoo\n\nForschern aus Austin, Texas, ist es gelungen, [mikroskopisch kleine Minikäfige für Bakterien herzustellen](http://zukun.tf/1b8nwPA). Dazu werden mit einem Laser in einer Art von 3D-Druck Protein-Strukturen um die Bakterien herum in Gelatin erzeugt. Diese Strukturen können dann frei bewegt werden, um gezielter und schneller das Verhalten zwischen verschiedenen Bakterienkulturen testen zu können.\n\nDen Wissenschaftlern zufolge erlaubt das völlig neue Arten von Experimenten, in denen die Gegebenheiten in den verschiedensten biologischen Umgebungen nachgestellt werden können, z.B. die im menschlichen Körper. Eines der Langzeitziele der Gruppe ist es, besser Infektionen bekämpfen zu können.\n\nKäfige für Bakterien aus Proteinen… Käfige für _Bakterien_ aus _Proteinen_. Und ich hatte als Kind schon Probleme, meine Schildkröte so einzusperren, dass sie mir nicht dauernd davonrannte.\n\n---\n\n## UltraHaptics: taktiles Feedback in der Luft\n\nTouchscreen, Maus, Keyboard, Trackpad, Joystick: das sind Eingabegeräte, die jeder kennt. Sie bieten direktes taktiles Feedback—ich merke, dass ich das Gerät berühre, und bei einigen Geräten bekomme ich auch Rückmeldung, dass etwas passiert, z.B. bei einem Joystick mit Force-Feedback, oder einem Smartphone, das meine Eingabe mit einer Vibration quittiert.\n\nBei berührungslosen Eingabegeräten wird es schwieriger; sei es vor einer [Xbox mit Kinect](http://www.xbox.com/de-DE/KINECT) oder mit einem [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com)—die Information, dass meine Bewegungen erkannt wurden, bekomme ich lediglich auf dem Bildschirm, die Bewegung an sich erfolgt ohne spürbares Feedback.\n\nDieses Problem hat jetzt (nach eigenen Angaben) ein Team der [University of Bristol’s Interaction and Graphics (BIG)](http://big.cs.bris.ac.uk/)-Gruppe gelöst.

Anders als bei herkömmlichen Anti-HIV-Blockern wäre ein Patient nicht ein Leben lang auf ein entsprechendes Medikament angewiesen, sondern könnte es nach der Behandlung absetzen, da es die Infektion nicht nur eingedämmt und unterdrückt, sondern umfassend ausgemerzt wird. Ciclopirox geht den virulenteren, ansteckenderen Haupterreger von AIDS an, HIV-1.</p>\n<p>Die Studie bezieht sich auf Experimente an Zellkulturen, Tests mit menschlichen Patienten stehen noch aus. Da der Arzneistoff jedoch schon seit Jahrzehnten in einer Vielzahl von Medikamenten eingesetzt wird, sind die Forscher zuversichtlich, dass derlei Tests schnell von den Behörden zugelassen werden.</p>\n<p>Quelle: <a href=\"http://news.rutgers.edu/news-release/drug-found-eradicate-hiv-permanently-infected-cells/20130924#.UkG3R7z8WMI\">Rutgers New Jersey Medical School</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"bionische-beinprothesen\">Bionische Beinprothesen</h2>\n<p>2009 verlor Zac Vawter bei einem Motorradunfall sein rechtes Bein, das über dem Knie amputiert werden musste. Vier Jahre und 8 Millionen USD später (die die U.S. Army im Rahmen eines Forschungsprogramms zur Verfügung stellte) ist er der Tester für <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/16ebl3S\">eine neue bionische Beinprothese</a>.</p>\n<p>Die Forscher vom <a href=\"http://www.ric.org/research/centers/bionic-medicine/\">Center for Bionic Medicine in Chicago, USA,</a> konzentrierten sich in der Entwicklung auf die Nervenbahnen, über die der Körper Steuersignale zum Knie und zum Knöchel des Patienten schickt—die “Empfänger” mögen zwar nicht mehr vorhanden sein, das Hirn sendet die Signale aber weiterhin aus. Das künstliche Bein registriert diese Nervenimpulse über Sensoren am Beinstumpf, wertet sie aus, und setzt die Informationen in aktive Bewegungen im neuen Knie und Knöchel um.</p>\n<p>Der Prototyp erlaubt es seinem Träger, Steigungen und Stufen zu nehmen, sowie sich zu setzen und aufzustehen, ohne irgendwelche Schalter oder Knöpfe bedienen zu müssen. Das ist ziemlich weit weg ist von üblichen, einfachen Prothesen. Dem Träger wird damit sehr viel Freiheit und Lebensqualität zurückgegeben. ( <a href=\"http://youtu.be/b3YgoYNgiMQ\">Das kurze Video zum Projekt</a> (0:49 min) ist sehr beeindruckend.)</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus-Links:</strong> Der Markt für “intelligente” Prothesen ist (leider) größer als man denkt.

Für mehr “Whoa!”-Momente empfehle ich, <a href=\"http://www.ossur.com/?PageID=15767\">Össur’s POWER KNEE</a> anzuschauen (“User Stories”!) oder auch <a href=\"http://youtu.be/it1A4qT1cHs\">MIT’s Hugh Herr’s <em>Google Zeitgeist</em>-Präsentation</a> (Video, 13:39 min).</p>\n<p>Quelle: <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/16ebl3S\">Stanford Engineering</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"energie-aus-abwasser\">Energie aus Abwasser</h2>\n<p>Ein interdisziplinäres Team von Technikern an der Stanford University <a href=\"http://zukun.tf/17oD2Hg\">hat einen “mikrobischen Akku” entwickelt</a>, der auf natürlich vorkommenden Bakterien basiert, die organische Abfälle in Biotreibstoff und Elektrizität umwandeln.</p>\n<p>Der Prototyp der Forscher besteht aus einem Glas mit Abwasser, in dem zwei Elektroden stecken, eine negativ und eine positiv geladene. Die sog. exoelektrogenischen Bakterien kletten sich an die negativ geladene Anode, und geben während des Mümmelns Elektrizität ab, die von der positiv geladenen Kathode eingefangen wird.</p>\n<p>Wenn wir Menschen eine Sache extrem gut beherrschen, dann ist es die Produktion von organischem Müll in allen Formen und Farben. (Menschen sind toll.) Dem Stanford-Team schwebt dementsprechend auch ein möglicher Einsatz in Klärwerken vor—ihr Prototyp erlaubt die Rückgewinnung von ca. 30% der im Abwasser gespeicherten Energie, und sie denken, dass bei einem industriellen Einsatz ihrer Idee diese Energie z.B. auch von den Klärwerken selbst genutzt werden könnte.</p>\n<p>Bis dahin stehen aber noch einige weiterführende Experimente und Verfeinerungen an.

Ein Grashüpfer! (Tusch.) Das <em>Grasshopper</em>-Projekt von <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/\">Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX)</a> ist der experimentelle Prototyp eines wiederverwendbaren suborbitalen Transportfahrzeugs, sozusagen einer “Mehrfach-Rakete”. Seit 2011 wird daran gearbeitet, und seit dem ersten Take-Off im letzten Jahr hat <em>Grasshopper</em> insgesamt schon 7 Testflüge hinter sich gebracht. Die Flüge bestehen im Moment noch aus mehr oder weniger kurzen “Hüpfern”: <em>Grasshopper</em> zündet, steigt ein paar Meter in die Luft und <strong>landet selbständig und aufrecht stehend</strong>. Die Flugzeit betrug bisher je nach Test zwischen 3 und 68 sek bei einer max. Flughöhe von 325 m. <a href=\"http://youtu.be/eGimzB5QM1M\">Hier ist ein sehenswertes Video des Testflugs im Juni</a> (1:26 min).</p>\n<p>Wozu der Aufwand? Weil es absolut unwirtschaftlich ist, “Wegwerf-Raketen” zu bauen. Laut dem Gründer von SpaceX, Elon Musk, machen Treibstoff und Sauerstoff nur ca. 0.35% der Kosten eines Raketenstarts aus ( <a href=\"http://youtu.be/3B5av0BOajU\">Video</a>, 1:36 min).

				"content_text": "Eine neue Woche, eine neue Ausgabe! Die Resonanz auf meinen kleinen Newsletter hier hat mich positiv überrascht—ca. 200 neue Subscribers sind seit der ersten Ausgabe vor 7 Tagen hinzugekommen, was mich durchaus beflügelt. Danke auch für Dein Interesse!\n\nMein persönliches Highlight in dieser Ausgabe ist das kurze Profil zu SpaceX’ _Grasshopper_-Projekt. Bei SpaceX muss ich immer aufpassen, dass ich mich vor Begeisterung nicht überschlage—diese Firma setzt bei mir alle Häkchen in den richtigen Checkboxen. :)\n\nHinter den Kulissen experimentiere ich mit dem Newsletter-Format noch etwas herum. Da nicht jede Woche mit unglaublich großartigen Meldungen gespickt ist, wie mir in der letzten Tagen klar wurde, werde ich hin und wieder auch mal Meldungen vergangener Monate aufgreifen und/oder ein Thema etwas umfassender behandeln. Eventuell gibts in der nächsten Woche auch eine Handvoll Kurzmeldungen (ein Link + ein Satz) zusätzlich; wir werden sehen.\n\nWenn Du Fragen, Vorschläge oder Beschwerden zum Newsletter-Format oder konkreten Themen hast, schreib mir eine Mail an [carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de](mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de)!

Wenn ich groben Unfug verzapft habe, lass es mich bitte wissen. :)_\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Pilz-Medikament tötet HIV-Zellen (in Zellkulturen)\n\nEin weitverbreitetes Antimykotikum (Arzneimittel zur Behandlung von Pilzinfektionen) namens [Ciclopirox](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclopirox) tötet effektiv HIV-infizierte Zellen ab, wie [eine neue Studie der Rutgers New Jersey Medical School](http://news.rutgers.edu/news-release/drug-found-eradicate-hiv-permanently-infected-cells/20130924#.UkG3R7z8WMI) belegt. Anders als bei herkömmlichen Anti-HIV-Blockern wäre ein Patient nicht ein Leben lang auf ein entsprechendes Medikament angewiesen, sondern könnte es nach der Behandlung absetzen, da es die Infektion nicht nur eingedämmt und unterdrückt, sondern umfassend ausgemerzt wird. Ciclopirox geht den virulenteren, ansteckenderen Haupterreger von AIDS an, HIV-1.\n\nDie Studie bezieht sich auf Experimente an Zellkulturen, Tests mit menschlichen Patienten stehen noch aus. Da der Arzneistoff jedoch schon seit Jahrzehnten in einer Vielzahl von Medikamenten eingesetzt wird, sind die Forscher zuversichtlich, dass derlei Tests schnell von den Behörden zugelassen werden.\n\nQuelle: [Rutgers New Jersey Medical School](http://news.rutgers.edu/news-release/drug-found-eradicate-hiv-permanently-infected-cells/20130924#.UkG3R7z8WMI).\n\n---\n\n## Bionische Beinprothesen\n\n2009 verlor Zac Vawter bei einem Motorradunfall sein rechtes Bein, das über dem Knie amputiert werden musste. Vier Jahre und 8 Millionen USD später (die die U.S. Army im Rahmen eines Forschungsprogramms zur Verfügung stellte) ist er der Tester für [eine neue bionische Beinprothese](http://zukun.tf/16ebl3S).\n\nDie Forscher vom [Center for Bionic Medicine in Chicago, USA,](http://www.ric.org/research/centers/bionic-medicine/) konzentrierten sich in der Entwicklung auf die Nervenbahnen, über die der Körper Steuersignale zum Knie und zum Knöchel des Patienten schickt—die “Empfänger” mögen zwar nicht mehr vorhanden sein, das Hirn sendet die Signale aber weiterhin aus. Das künstliche Bein registriert diese Nervenimpulse über Sensoren am Beinstumpf, wertet sie aus, und setzt die Informationen in aktive Bewegungen im neuen Knie und Knöchel um.\n\nDer Prototyp erlaubt es seinem Träger, Steigungen und Stufen zu nehmen, sowie sich zu setzen und aufzustehen, ohne irgendwelche Schalter oder Knöpfe bedienen zu müssen. Das ist ziemlich weit weg ist von üblichen, einfachen Prothesen. Dem Träger wird damit sehr viel Freiheit und Lebensqualität zurückgegeben. ( [Das kurze Video zum Projekt](http://youtu.be/b3YgoYNgiMQ) (0:49 min) ist sehr beeindruckend.)\n\n**Bonus-Links:** Der Markt für “intelligente” Prothesen ist (leider) größer als man denkt. Objektiv betrachtet gibt es in diesem Feld in den letzten Jahren aber wirklich tolle Entwicklungen. Für mehr “Whoa!”-Momente empfehle ich, [Össur’s POWER KNEE](http://www.ossur.com/?PageID=15767) anzuschauen (“User Stories”!) oder auch [MIT’s Hugh Herr’s _Google Zeitgeist_-Präsentation](http://youtu.be/it1A4qT1cHs) (Video, 13:39 min).\n\nQuelle: [Stanford Engineering](http://zukun.tf/16ebl3S).\n\n---\n\n## Energie aus Abwasser\n\nEin interdisziplinäres Team von Technikern an der Stanford University [hat einen “mikrobischen Akku” entwickelt](http://zukun.tf/17oD2Hg), der auf natürlich vorkommenden Bakterien basiert, die organische Abfälle in Biotreibstoff und Elektrizität umwandeln.\n\nDer Prototyp der Forscher besteht aus einem Glas mit Abwasser, in dem zwei Elektroden stecken, eine negativ und eine positiv geladene. Die sog. exoelektrogenischen Bakterien kletten sich an die negativ geladene Anode, und geben während des Mümmelns Elektrizität ab, die von der positiv geladenen Kathode eingefangen wird.\n\nWenn wir Menschen eine Sache extrem gut beherrschen, dann ist es die Produktion von organischem Müll in allen Formen und Farben. (Menschen sind toll.) Dem Stanford-Team schwebt dementsprechend auch ein möglicher Einsatz in Klärwerken vor—ihr Prototyp erlaubt die Rückgewinnung von ca. 30% der im Abwasser gespeicherten Energie, und sie denken, dass bei einem industriellen Einsatz ihrer Idee diese Energie z.B. auch von den Klärwerken selbst genutzt werden könnte.\n\nBis dahin stehen aber noch einige weiterführende Experimente und Verfeinerungen an. So besteht derzeit u.A. des Prototyp’s Kathode aus Silveroxid, die Verwendung von Silber im großen Stil aber wäre wenig wirtschaftlich.\n\nQuelle: [Stanford Engineering](http://zukun.tf/17oD2Hg), via [SciTechDaily](http://zukun.tf/16ecKr0).\n\n---\n\n## Transparente Photovoltaik\n\nDas französische Unternehmen [SunPartner Technologies](http://sunpartnergroup.com/) hat ein durchsichtiges Material namens [_Wysips Crystal_](http://zukun.tf/GBwJqh) vorgestellt, das natürliches und künstliches Licht in photovoltaischen Strom erzeugt und vom Hersteller für den Einsatz z.B. in Smartphones und Tablets vorgesehen ist. Das Material wäre Teil des Displays; SunPartner gibt an, dass eine solche Schicht bei 90% Transparenz ca. 2,5 Milliwatt/cm² erzeugen würde, was ~3 min zusätzlicher Akkuleistung bei 10 min Lichteinstrahlung bedeuten würde.\n\nSunPartner hat im Juli die [Zusammenarbeit mit dem chinesischen Elektronikhersteller TCL Communication bekanntgegeben](http://zukun.tf/GBx24w), der die Wysips-Technologie in seinen Smartphones einsetzen will. Und im Aerospace-Sektor kommt das verwandte [_Wysips Glass_](http://zukun.tf/GBwTOt) der Firma in [stromerzeugenden Flugzeugfenstern von Vision Systems](http://zukun.tf/GBwWdh) (PDF) zum Einsatz (die sog. _Energia_-Fenster werden auf der Flugzeugmesse NBAA 2013 Ende Oktober vorgestellt).\n\nJe mehr ich über diese Technologie nachdenke, desto cooler finde ich sie. Fenster und Glasflächen sind überall, ich sehe da so viele Möglichkeiten…\n\n---\n\n## Wirtschaftlichkeit… IN SPACE\n\nWas sieht aus wie eine 32 m hohe, schlanke Tonne, und hat vier Beine plus Raketenantrieb? Ein Grashüpfer! (Tusch.) Das _Grasshopper_-Projekt von [Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX)](http://www.spacex.com/) ist der experimentelle Prototyp eines wiederverwendbaren suborbitalen Transportfahrzeugs, sozusagen einer “Mehrfach-Rakete”. Seit 2011 wird daran gearbeitet, und seit dem ersten Take-Off im letzten Jahr hat _Grasshopper_ insgesamt schon 7 Testflüge hinter sich gebracht. Die Flüge bestehen im Moment noch aus mehr oder weniger kurzen “Hüpfern”: _Grasshopper_ zündet, steigt ein paar Meter in die Luft und **landet selbständig und aufrecht stehend**. Die Flugzeit betrug bisher je nach Test zwischen 3 und 68 sek bei einer max. Flughöhe von 325 m. [Hier ist ein sehenswertes Video des Testflugs im Juni](http://youtu.be/eGimzB5QM1M) (1:26 min).\n\nWozu der Aufwand? Weil es absolut unwirtschaftlich ist, “Wegwerf-Raketen” zu bauen. Laut dem Gründer von SpaceX, Elon Musk, machen Treibstoff und Sauerstoff nur ca. 0.35% der Kosten eines Raketenstarts aus ( [Video](http://youtu.be/3B5av0BOajU), 1:36 min). Die restlichen $56,3 mio für den Start einer [SpaceX- _Falcon 9_-Rakete](http://www.spacex.com/falcon9) gehen für das eigentliche Gefährt drauf. (Musk vergleicht traditionelle Startmethoden auch mit dem Verschrotten einer 747 nach ihrem ersten Flug.) Das erklärte Ziel von SpaceX ist deshalb auch die Wiederverwendbarkeit der Raketen—die einzelnen Stufen würden nach dem Abliefern ihrer Ladung nicht in der Atmosphäre verglühen oder ins Meer stürzen, sondern eigenständig für den nächsten Einsatz zur Basis zurückkehren. Je öfter sie benutzt werden können, desto niedriger werden dementsprechend auch die Kosten pro Start. Elon Musk ist fest davon überzeugt, [dass die Menschheit eine multiplanetare Spezies werden muss](http://zukun.tf/GBxiR3), um auf lange Sicht zu überleben, und komplett wiederverwendbare Raumfahrzeuge sind dafür unerlässlich.\n\n(Ich stimme ihm in diesem Punkt übrigens 100%ig zu!

				"content_html": "<p>Hi, ich bin Carlo Zottmann, und ich werde 140 Jahre alt, mindestens. Das heisst, ich habe noch 100 Jahre vor mir, hoffentlich mehr.</p>\n<p>Wenn ich diese Vermutung und Hoffnung äussere, schlagen mir meistens Heiterkeit und Unverständnis entgegen. <em>“Opa Erwin ist 72 Jahre alt und kann kaum noch kriechen, und Tante Emmi ist 81 und seit 5 Jahren dement, und wovon soll ich leben, wenn ich ab Mitte 60 keine Arbeit mehr habe, etc. Warum würdest Du das wollen? Du bist ja verrückt, Carlo.”</em></p>\n<p>Bin ich das? Ich sage ja nicht, dass ich ab dem 70. Lebensjahr pflegebedürftig sein möchte. Ich gehe davon aus, dass wir fitter und gesünder altern werde als vorherige Generationen. Die Chancen dafür stehen ausgezeichnet, wenn man sich die Entwicklungen in der Biotechnologie, in Genetik und Langlebigkeitsforschung anschaut.</p>\n<p><em>“Ja, aber die Menschheit kämpft jetzt schon ums Überleben, in 50-100 Jahren wird das alles noch viel furchtbarer sein, warum willst Du Dir das antun?”</em> Weil ich die Forschung und Erfolge in grüner Energietechnik, in Robotik, in künstlicher Intelligenz, in kommerzieller Raumfahrt usw. beobachte, und mich das alles sehr, sehr hoffnungsvoll stimmt. Die Erde wird überleben, wir werden nicht ewig <em>nur</em> hier leben, und das würde ich gern noch miterleben. Du nicht?</p>\n<p>Vor ein paar Monaten dämmerte es mir dann: es gibt unglaublich viele gute Nachrichten, von denen allerdings kaum jemand etwas erfährt. Unsere Nachrichten berichten nur von Problemen, Katastrophen, Mord, Krieg und der Bundestagswahl, und wenn das alles ist, das man aufnimmt, wird das eigene Weltbild u.U. negativ verzerrt. Aber die (für mich) wichtigeren, interessanteren, zukunftsbejahenderen Themen, die optimistisch stimmen, die muss man mit der Lupe suchen, und das ist tragisch.</p>\n<p>Ich denke, ich freue mich mehr als viele Andere auf die Zukunft, weil ich mehrere Forschungsrichtungen im Auge behalte, und deren Erfolge nicht separat, sondern als Gesamtbild betrachte. Wir leben in einer Zeit, in der wir funktionierende Mäuseherzen im Labor züchten; in der <a href=\"http://www.sueddeutsche.de/auto/selbstfahrende-autos-rollende-rechenzentren-1.1755403\">selbstfahrende Automobile</a> keine SciFi mehr sind; in der eine die größten Techfirmen der Welt <a href=\"http://business.time.com/2013/09/18/google-extend-human-life/\">den Kampf gegen das Altern aufnimmt</a>; in der hochentwickelte <a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/prosthetics/darpa-pushes-bionic-arm-boundaries-15686071\">Arm-Prothesen für verwundete Veteranen</a> mit nahezu voller Beweglichkeit existieren; in der <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/17/elon-musk-mission-mars-spacex\">einer der größten lebenden Erfinder/Macher den Mars als Lebensraum anvisiert</a>, ohne dafür von aller Welt ausgelacht zu werden. Vor 20 Jahren war das alles noch undenkbar, vor 10 Jahren war lag es noch “in weiter Ferne”, und heute? Heute frage ich mich, wie die Welt 2023 oder 2033 aussehen wird.</p>\n<p>Die These des <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change\"><em>Accelerating Change</em>, des sich beschleunigenden Wandels</a>: in meinen Augen ist sie korrekt. Das Tempo der technischen Entwicklung ist keine gerade Linie, es ist eine steiler werdende Kurve. Die berühmte Katze ist nicht nur aus dem Sack, nein, sie hat mittlerweile auch mehrere extrem süße Babies bekommen.</p>\n<p><strong>Ich will meinen Optimismus teilen, und werde in <em>Neues aus der Zukunft</em> jede Woche 4-5 Projekte vorstellen, die in den letzten Tagen meine Aufmerksamkeit erregt und mich aufgebaut haben.</strong> Ich will verständlich schreiben, und nicht <em>zu</em> technisch werden. Und ich hoffe, ich kann damit Deine Neugier wecken und auch Deine Laune verbessern.</p>\n<p>Bleib optimistisch—es gibt gute Gründe dafür.

Die angelegten Spannungen werden also nicht von Elektronen übertragen, wie man es z.B. von Küchenmixern, iPads und Flugzeugträgern kennt, sondern von Ionen, wie es im menschlichen Körper geschieht. Das Material ist darüber hinaus auch noch weit dehnbar, ohne seinen Widerstand zu vergrößern, was beim möglichen Einsatz in Form von künstlichen Muskeln oder Haut sehr praktisch ist. Die Wissenschaftler haben hier klar sog. <em>“soft machines”</em> im Auge: biologische Systeme, wie sie in der Natur vorkommen.</p>\n<p>Um die Eigenschaften ihres neuen Materials zu demonstrieren, hat das Team als Konzeptstudie einen ionischen, transparenten Stretch-Lautsprecher entwickelt. Mit seinem interessanten Sandwichaufbau (eine Schicht Salzwassergel, eine Schicht Gummi, eine Schicht Salzwassergel) kann er Sounds im Frequenzbereich zwischen 20Hz und 20kHz wiedergeben. Dieser Lautsprecher ist aber tatsächlich nur ein Vorführprodukt, das dazu dient, den entwickelten ionischen Leiter mit seinen herausragenden Fähigkeiten zu demonstrieren. Weitere Einsatzfelder sehen die Forscher u.A. in adaptiven optischen Systeme oder auch der Robotik.</p>\n<p>Ich persönlich freue mich auf künstliche Muskelstränge, mit denen ich subdermal meine Umwelt mit Dubstep erfreuen kann.</p>\n<p>Quelle: <a href=\"https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2013/08/transparent-artificial-muscle-plays-grieg-to-prove-point/\">Harvard.edu</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"stammzellen-forschung-jetzt-mit-weniger-petrischalen\">Stammzellen-Forschung: Jetzt mit weniger Petrischalen</h2>\n<p>Amerikanische Wissenschaftler haben… halt, nein, diesmal nicht. Ein Team vom Nationalen Krebsforschungszentrum (CNIO) in Madrid, Spanien, hat embryonale Stammzellen erzeugt—aus normalen Zellen eines erwachsenen Organismus (Maus), direkt im Körper, ohne Umwege über Petrischalen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Stammzellen#Embryonale_Stammzellen_.28ES-Zellen.29\">Embryonale Stammzellen</a> sind einer der Hauptpfeiler der regenerativen Medizin, da sie “Urzellen” darstellen, die vom Körper noch nicht spezialisiert worden sind. Aus ihnen können jedwede Zelltypen eines erwachsenen Organismus entstehen, um dann z.B. Autoimmunkrankheiten zu bekämpfen, beschädigte Zellen zu zu reparieren, oder neue Organe zu bilden. Allerdings ist die Gewinnung dieser Stammzellen <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stammzellen#Ethische_Kontroverse\">ethisch nicht unproblematisch</a>. Seit 1981 kam hier die sog. “destruktive Embryonenforschung” zum Einsatz (ist genau das, wonach es klingt, oiy). Im Jahr 2006 entwickelten japanische Forscher dann die <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stammzellen#K.C3.BCnstlich_reprogrammierte_Stammzellen\">künstliche Reprogrammierung</a> von Körperzellen erwachsener Menschen ausserhalb des Körpers, wofür sie 2012 auch den Nobelpreis für Medizin bekamen. Der Prozess ist allerdings langwierig (erwachsene Zellen werden entnommen und im Labor bearbeitet, was ca. einen Monat in Anspruch nimmt) und nur ca. 1% der behandelten Zellen werden dabei erfolgreich in Stammzellen umgewandelt.</p>\n<p>Die CNIO-Studie setzt auf dieser künstlichen Reprogrammierung auf, geht aber noch einen großen Schritt weiter, da die Gewinnung/Umwandlung der Originalzellen <strong>komplett</strong> im Körper durchgeführt wird, und die gewonnenen Stammzellen vielfältiger einsetzbar sind.</p>\n<p>Die spanischen Forscher denken als Ziel u.A. an lokale regenerative Behandlungen, bei denen die Zell-Regeneration direkt an den verletzten Stellen veranlasst wird. <em>“Im nächsten Schritt untersuchen wir, ob diese neuen Stammzellen imstande sind, effizient unterschiedlichen Gewebetypen zu generieren, wie z.B. Bauchspeicheldrüse, Leber oder Niere.”</em>, sagte María Abad, eine der an der Studie beteiligten Wissenschaftler.</p>\n<p>Bei aller wissenschaftlichen Euphorie gibt das Team aber zu bedenken, dass praktische Anwendungen an menschlichen Patienten noch in weiter Ferne liegen. Allerdings habe ich persönlich das Gefühl, dass der Begriff <em>“in weiter Ferne</em> von Jahr zu Jahr einen kürzeren Zeitabstand umfasst. (Ich heisse das gut.)</p>\n<p>Oh, und während ich mich noch über den CNIO-Durchbruch freute, kam aus Israel die Nachricht, dass <a href=\"http://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/stem-cell-reprogramming-made-easier\">ein Forscherteam vom Weizmann Institute of Science die ursprüngliche Reprogrammierung verbessert</a> hat: durch die Entfernung eines Proteins konnten sie den Prozess von 4 Wochen auf 8 Tage beschleunigen, und die Erfolgsrate von 1% auf ca. 100% erhöhen.</p>\n<p>Bonus-Link: <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/61611.php?from=248566\">ein kurzes (englisch-sprachiges) Video</a>, das die bahnbrechende CNIO-Studie erklärt.</p>\n<p>Quelle: <a href=\"http://www.cnio.es/es/news/docs/manuel-serrano-nature-11sep13-en.pdf\">Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO)</a>, via <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130911131957.htm\">ScienceDaily</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"eine-gute-zeit-für-mäuseherzen\">Eine gute Zeit für Mäuseherzen</h2>\n<p>Aus der Rubrik <em>“Wir werden alle mindestens 200 Jahre alt”</em>:</p>\n<p>Mitte August diesen Jahres haben Wissenschaftler der <a href=\"http://www.medschool.pitt.edu/\">University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine</a> ein funktionierendes Mäuseherz aus menschlichen <a href=\"http://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Precursorzelle\">Precursor-Zellen</a> gezüchtet. Das Experiment ist ein erster Schritt dahin, funktionierende Herzen aus <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induzierte_pluripotente_Stammzelle\">induzierten pluripotenten Stammzellen</a> herzustellen—für Transplationen, als Testobjekt für Medikamente und für die Herzforschung.</p>\n<p>Als Ausgangspunkt für ihr Projekt diente dem Team ein Mäuseherz, dem alle Zellen entfernt wurden. Zurück blieb ein “Gerüst”, also die leere Grundstruktur des Herzens. Dieses Gerüst wurde mit sog. <em>multipotent cardiovascular progenitor (MCP)</em>-Zellen bevölkert, die zuvor aus menschlichen Hautzellen gewonnen wurden.</p>\n<p>Nach einigen Wochen hatte sich das kleine Herz nicht nur aus diesen Zellen regeneriert, es begann auch mit 40-50 Schlägen pro Minute selbständig zu pumpen.</p>\n<p>Bevor jetzt die Korken knallen, weil wir nun neue Herzen bei Bedarf im Labor züchten können: Die Wissenschaftler weisen darauf hin, dass mehr Arbeit und Forschung nötig ist, um das Herz komplett nachzubilden—um es stark genug zu machen, um zuverlässig Blut pumpen zu können, und um sicherzustellen, dass es korrekt auf die elektrischen Signale des Körpers reagiert.</p>\n<p>Eins der nächsten Forschungsziele des Teams ist, eventuell auf einem ähnlichen Wege menschliche Herzmuskel herzustellen, um beschädigte Organe reparieren zu können.</p>\n<p>Quelle: <a href=\"http://www.upmc.com/media/NewsReleases/2013/Pages/pitt-project-shows-mouse-heart-beats-after-regeneration.aspx\">upmc.com</a>, via\n<a href=\"http://www.upmc.com/media/NewsReleases/2013/Pages/pitt-project-shows-mouse-heart-beats-after-regeneration.aspx\">ScienceDaily</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"ich-druck-mir-eine-raumstation\">Ich druck' mir eine Raumstation</h2>\n<p>NASA’s <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Institute_for_Advanced_Concepts\">Institute for Advanced Concepts</a> hat einen mit 500.000 USD dotierten sog. <em>Phase II</em>-Vertrag an die Firma <a href=\"http://www.tethers.com/\">Tethers Unlimited</a> für ihr <a href=\"http://www.tethers.com/SpiderFab.html\">Spiderfab</a>-System vergeben— <strong>einen 3D-Drucker für orbitale Konstruktionen</strong>.</p>\n<p>Spiderfab ist eine Mischung aus herkömmlichem 3D-Drucker und Roboter-gestützter Montage. Der Gedanke dahinter: Rohmaterialien in Block- oder Rollenform ins All zu befördern, wo sie dann automatisiert in größere und kleinere Strukturen “gedruckt” werden. Dies wäre logistisch einfacher, als diese Konstrukte auf der Erde zu bauen, zu zerlegen, transportsicher zu verpacken und ins All zu schicken, nur um sie dort wieder zusammenzusetzen. Schliesslich macht es Sinn, Komponenten für den Einsatz in der Schwerelosigkeit—wie Antennen, Träger, Solarpanelstrukturen, etc.—direkt im Orbit herzustellen, anstatt sie wie bisher für Montage, Lagerung, Demontage und Transport für mindestens 1G auslegen zu müssen. Die Spiderfab-Technologie könnte dementsprechend vor Ort auch Konstruktionen wie z.B. Antennenreflektoren oder Solarpanele ermöglichen, die 10- bis 100-mal so groß sind wie die bisherigen Versionen.</p>\n<p>Parallel zum NIAC-Vertrag entwickelt Tethers Unlimited ebenfalls für die NASA ein Gerät namens “Trusselator”, das Trägerstrukturen fabrizieren soll, die im Orbit zu großen Solar-Arrays zusammengesetzt werden. Dies soll als Ausgangspunkt für weitere Entwicklungen dienen.</p>\n<p>Ich finde es toll, wenn Meldungen wie diese zwar noch nach Science Fiction klingen, es aber nicht mehr sind. Vor 10 Jahren war der Zugang zum Weltraum noch Staaten vorenthalten, nicht kommerziell arbeitenden Firmen.

Ich will nicht lügen: die Nachricht hat mir Gänsehaut gemacht—aber die gute Art.</p>\n<p>Man mag von Google halten, was man will; ich weiss, wie viele meiner Mitbürger reagieren, wenn der Name “Google” fällt. ;) Aber ignorieren wir für einen Moment mal die endlosen Diskussionen um Cookies, Gmail, NSA und Streetview—ich denke, jeder wird zugeben, dass die Firma ungeschlagen darin ist, unfassbar große Datenmengen umfassend, clever und oft in überraschender Weise auszuwerten. Einige der klügsten Köpfe unserer Generationen sind dort beschäftigt; ich sage: lasst sie forschen, auswerten und an den Geheimnissen des menschlichen Körpers arbeiten! Wir können dabei nur gewinnen.</p>\n<p><em>“Aber warum Google, machen die nicht nur Werbeanzeigen und Email und so?”</em> Der Konzern macht damit das Gros seiner Einnahmen, ja, aber seit ein paar Jahren stürzt er sich auch mit großer Energie und oft ebensogroßen Erfolgen auf Bereiche, die nicht soviel mit Ads und Websuche zu tun haben: er entwickelt <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_driverless_car\">selbstfahrende Automobile</a> oder auch <a href=\"http://www.google.com/loon/\">Ballon-basierte Internetknoten</a> für abgelegene Orte auf der Welt. Und ja: sicher wird Google damit auch irgendwann Geld verdienen wollen, aber damit kann ich sehr leben. Sie sind auf ein langes Spiel eingestellt, und akzeptieren, dass die ersten paar Jahre ein Verlustgeschäft sein werden; der Rest von uns bekommt neue Technologien, die großes Potential zur Disruption haben.</p>\n<p>Zurück zu Calico. Der Traum, älter zu werden als frühere Generationen, er ist so alt wie die Menschheit selbst. Es gibt viele Firmen und Stiftungen, die sich seit Jahrzehnten mit dem Thema beschäftigen, aktiv Forschung betreiben und auch finanzieren.

Das heisst, ich habe noch 100 Jahre vor mir, hoffentlich mehr.\n\nWenn ich diese Vermutung und Hoffnung äussere, schlagen mir meistens Heiterkeit und Unverständnis entgegen. _“Opa Erwin ist 72 Jahre alt und kann kaum noch kriechen, und Tante Emmi ist 81 und seit 5 Jahren dement, und wovon soll ich leben, wenn ich ab Mitte 60 keine Arbeit mehr habe, etc. Warum würdest Du das wollen? Du bist ja verrückt, Carlo.”_\n\nBin ich das? Ich sage ja nicht, dass ich ab dem 70. Lebensjahr pflegebedürftig sein möchte. Ich gehe davon aus, dass wir fitter und gesünder altern werde als vorherige Generationen. Die Chancen dafür stehen ausgezeichnet, wenn man sich die Entwicklungen in der Biotechnologie, in Genetik und Langlebigkeitsforschung anschaut.\n\n_“Ja, aber die Menschheit kämpft jetzt schon ums Überleben, in 50-100 Jahren wird das alles noch viel furchtbarer sein, warum willst Du Dir das antun?”_ Weil ich die Forschung und Erfolge in grüner Energietechnik, in Robotik, in künstlicher Intelligenz, in kommerzieller Raumfahrt usw. beobachte, und mich das alles sehr, sehr hoffnungsvoll stimmt. Die Erde wird überleben, wir werden nicht ewig _nur_ hier leben, und das würde ich gern noch miterleben. Du nicht?\n\nVor ein paar Monaten dämmerte es mir dann: es gibt unglaublich viele gute Nachrichten, von denen allerdings kaum jemand etwas erfährt. Unsere Nachrichten berichten nur von Problemen, Katastrophen, Mord, Krieg und der Bundestagswahl, und wenn das alles ist, das man aufnimmt, wird das eigene Weltbild u.U. negativ verzerrt. Aber die (für mich) wichtigeren, interessanteren, zukunftsbejahenderen Themen, die optimistisch stimmen, die muss man mit der Lupe suchen, und das ist tragisch.\n\nIch denke, ich freue mich mehr als viele Andere auf die Zukunft, weil ich mehrere Forschungsrichtungen im Auge behalte, und deren Erfolge nicht separat, sondern als Gesamtbild betrachte. Wir leben in einer Zeit, in der wir funktionierende Mäuseherzen im Labor züchten; in der [selbstfahrende Automobile](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/auto/selbstfahrende-autos-rollende-rechenzentren-1.1755403) keine SciFi mehr sind; in der eine die größten Techfirmen der Welt [den Kampf gegen das Altern aufnimmt](http://business.time.com/2013/09/18/google-extend-human-life/); in der hochentwickelte [Arm-Prothesen für verwundete Veteranen](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/prosthetics/darpa-pushes-bionic-arm-boundaries-15686071) mit nahezu voller Beweglichkeit existieren; in der [einer der größten lebenden Erfinder/Macher den Mars als Lebensraum anvisiert](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/17/elon-musk-mission-mars-spacex), ohne dafür von aller Welt ausgelacht zu werden. Vor 20 Jahren war das alles noch undenkbar, vor 10 Jahren war lag es noch “in weiter Ferne”, und heute? Heute frage ich mich, wie die Welt 2023 oder 2033 aussehen wird.\n\nDie These des [_Accelerating Change_, des sich beschleunigenden Wandels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change): in meinen Augen ist sie korrekt. Das Tempo der technischen Entwicklung ist keine gerade Linie, es ist eine steiler werdende Kurve. Die berühmte Katze ist nicht nur aus dem Sack, nein, sie hat mittlerweile auch mehrere extrem süße Babies bekommen.\n\n**Ich will meinen Optimismus teilen, und werde in _Neues aus der Zukunft_ jede Woche 4-5 Projekte vorstellen, die in den letzten Tagen meine Aufmerksamkeit erregt und mich aufgebaut haben.** Ich will verständlich schreiben, und nicht _zu_ technisch werden. Und ich hoffe, ich kann damit Deine Neugier wecken und auch Deine Laune verbessern.\n\nBleib optimistisch—es gibt gute Gründe dafür. Und wenn Dir diese Ausgabe gefällt, empfiehl sie bitte weiter!\n\n—Carlo.\n\nPS: Bei Fragen/Vorschlägen/Beschwerden schreib mir eine Mail an [carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de](mailto:carlo@neues-aus-der-zukunft.de)! Ich bin kein Wissenschaftler, nur ein interessierter Amateur, und auch wenn ich alle Zusammenfassungen nach bestem Wissen und Gewissen schreibe, so können sich doch Fehler einschleichen. Wenn ich groben Unfug verzapft habe, lass es mich bitte wissen. :)\n\n---\n\n## Da ist Musike drin\n\nEin Forscherteam der [Harvard University in Cambridge](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/) (Mass., USA) hat ein biokompatibles, leitfähiges Material entwickelt, das ionische Ladungen transportiert. Die angelegten Spannungen werden also nicht von Elektronen übertragen, wie man es z.B. von Küchenmixern, iPads und Flugzeugträgern kennt, sondern von Ionen, wie es im menschlichen Körper geschieht. Das Material ist darüber hinaus auch noch weit dehnbar, ohne seinen Widerstand zu vergrößern, was beim möglichen Einsatz in Form von künstlichen Muskeln oder Haut sehr praktisch ist. Die Wissenschaftler haben hier klar sog. _“soft machines”_ im Auge: biologische Systeme, wie sie in der Natur vorkommen.\n\nUm die Eigenschaften ihres neuen Materials zu demonstrieren, hat das Team als Konzeptstudie einen ionischen, transparenten Stretch-Lautsprecher entwickelt. Mit seinem interessanten Sandwichaufbau (eine Schicht Salzwassergel, eine Schicht Gummi, eine Schicht Salzwassergel) kann er Sounds im Frequenzbereich zwischen 20Hz und 20kHz wiedergeben. Dieser Lautsprecher ist aber tatsächlich nur ein Vorführprodukt, das dazu dient, den entwickelten ionischen Leiter mit seinen herausragenden Fähigkeiten zu demonstrieren. Weitere Einsatzfelder sehen die Forscher u.A. in adaptiven optischen Systeme oder auch der Robotik.\n\nIch persönlich freue mich auf künstliche Muskelstränge, mit denen ich subdermal meine Umwelt mit Dubstep erfreuen kann.\n\nQuelle: [Harvard.edu](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2013/08/transparent-artificial-muscle-plays-grieg-to-prove-point/).\n\n---\n\n## Stammzellen-Forschung: Jetzt mit weniger Petrischalen\n\nAmerikanische Wissenschaftler haben… halt, nein, diesmal nicht. Ein Team vom Nationalen Krebsforschungszentrum (CNIO) in Madrid, Spanien, hat embryonale Stammzellen erzeugt—aus normalen Zellen eines erwachsenen Organismus (Maus), direkt im Körper, ohne Umwege über Petrischalen.\n\n[Embryonale Stammzellen](http://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Stammzellen#Embryonale_Stammzellen_.28ES-Zellen.29) sind einer der Hauptpfeiler der regenerativen Medizin, da sie “Urzellen” darstellen, die vom Körper noch nicht spezialisiert worden sind. Aus ihnen können jedwede Zelltypen eines erwachsenen Organismus entstehen, um dann z.B. Autoimmunkrankheiten zu bekämpfen, beschädigte Zellen zu zu reparieren, oder neue Organe zu bilden. Allerdings ist die Gewinnung dieser Stammzellen [ethisch nicht unproblematisch](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stammzellen#Ethische_Kontroverse). Seit 1981 kam hier die sog. “destruktive Embryonenforschung” zum Einsatz (ist genau das, wonach es klingt, oiy). Im Jahr 2006 entwickelten japanische Forscher dann die [künstliche Reprogrammierung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stammzellen#K.C3.BCnstlich_reprogrammierte_Stammzellen) von Körperzellen erwachsener Menschen ausserhalb des Körpers, wofür sie 2012 auch den Nobelpreis für Medizin bekamen. Der Prozess ist allerdings langwierig (erwachsene Zellen werden entnommen und im Labor bearbeitet, was ca. einen Monat in Anspruch nimmt) und nur ca. 1% der behandelten Zellen werden dabei erfolgreich in Stammzellen umgewandelt.\n\nDie CNIO-Studie setzt auf dieser künstlichen Reprogrammierung auf, geht aber noch einen großen Schritt weiter, da die Gewinnung/Umwandlung der Originalzellen **komplett** im Körper durchgeführt wird, und die gewonnenen Stammzellen vielfältiger einsetzbar sind.\n\nDie spanischen Forscher denken als Ziel u.A. an lokale regenerative Behandlungen, bei denen die Zell-Regeneration direkt an den verletzten Stellen veranlasst wird. _“Im nächsten Schritt untersuchen wir, ob diese neuen Stammzellen imstande sind, effizient unterschiedlichen Gewebetypen zu generieren, wie z.B. Bauchspeicheldrüse, Leber oder Niere.”_, sagte María Abad, eine der an der Studie beteiligten Wissenschaftler.\n\nBei aller wissenschaftlichen Euphorie gibt das Team aber zu bedenken, dass praktische Anwendungen an menschlichen Patienten noch in weiter Ferne liegen. Allerdings habe ich persönlich das Gefühl, dass der Begriff _“in weiter Ferne_ von Jahr zu Jahr einen kürzeren Zeitabstand umfasst. (Ich heisse das gut.)\n\nOh, und während ich mich noch über den CNIO-Durchbruch freute, kam aus Israel die Nachricht, dass [ein Forscherteam vom Weizmann Institute of Science die ursprüngliche Reprogrammierung verbessert](http://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/stem-cell-reprogramming-made-easier) hat: durch die Entfernung eines Proteins konnten sie den Prozess von 4 Wochen auf 8 Tage beschleunigen, und die Erfolgsrate von 1% auf ca. 100% erhöhen.\n\nBonus-Link: [ein kurzes (englisch-sprachiges) Video](http://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/61611.php?from=248566), das die bahnbrechende CNIO-Studie erklärt.\n\nQuelle: [Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO)](http://www.cnio.es/es/news/docs/manuel-serrano-nature-11sep13-en.pdf), via [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130911131957.htm).\n\n---\n\n## Eine gute Zeit für Mäuseherzen\n\nAus der Rubrik _“Wir werden alle mindestens 200 Jahre alt”_:\n\nMitte August diesen Jahres haben Wissenschaftler der [University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine](http://www.medschool.pitt.edu/) ein funktionierendes Mäuseherz aus menschlichen [Precursor-Zellen](http://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Precursorzelle) gezüchtet. Das Experiment ist ein erster Schritt dahin, funktionierende Herzen aus [induzierten pluripotenten Stammzellen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induzierte_pluripotente_Stammzelle) herzustellen—für Transplationen, als Testobjekt für Medikamente und für die Herzforschung.\n\nAls Ausgangspunkt für ihr Projekt diente dem Team ein Mäuseherz, dem alle Zellen entfernt wurden. Zurück blieb ein “Gerüst”, also die leere Grundstruktur des Herzens. Dieses Gerüst wurde mit sog. _multipotent cardiovascular progenitor (MCP)_-Zellen bevölkert, die zuvor aus menschlichen Hautzellen gewonnen wurden.\n\nNach einigen Wochen hatte sich das kleine Herz nicht nur aus diesen Zellen regeneriert, es begann auch mit 40-50 Schlägen pro Minute selbständig zu pumpen.\n\nBevor jetzt die Korken knallen, weil wir nun neue Herzen bei Bedarf im Labor züchten können: Die Wissenschaftler weisen darauf hin, dass mehr Arbeit und Forschung nötig ist, um das Herz komplett nachzubilden—um es stark genug zu machen, um zuverlässig Blut pumpen zu können, und um sicherzustellen, dass es korrekt auf die elektrischen Signale des Körpers reagiert.\n\nEins der nächsten Forschungsziele des Teams ist, eventuell auf einem ähnlichen Wege menschliche Herzmuskel herzustellen, um beschädigte Organe reparieren zu können.\n\nQuelle: [upmc.com](http://www.upmc.com/media/NewsReleases/2013/Pages/pitt-project-shows-mouse-heart-beats-after-regeneration.aspx), via\n[ScienceDaily](http://www.upmc.com/media/NewsReleases/2013/Pages/pitt-project-shows-mouse-heart-beats-after-regeneration.aspx).\n\n---\n\n## Ich druck' mir eine Raumstation\n\nNASA’s [Institute for Advanced Concepts](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Institute_for_Advanced_Concepts) hat einen mit 500.000 USD dotierten sog. _Phase II_-Vertrag an die Firma [Tethers Unlimited](http://www.tethers.com/) für ihr [Spiderfab](http://www.tethers.com/SpiderFab.html)-System vergeben— **einen 3D-Drucker für orbitale Konstruktionen**.\n\nSpiderfab ist eine Mischung aus herkömmlichem 3D-Drucker und Roboter-gestützter Montage. Der Gedanke dahinter: Rohmaterialien in Block- oder Rollenform ins All zu befördern, wo sie dann automatisiert in größere und kleinere Strukturen “gedruckt” werden. Dies wäre logistisch einfacher, als diese Konstrukte auf der Erde zu bauen, zu zerlegen, transportsicher zu verpacken und ins All zu schicken, nur um sie dort wieder zusammenzusetzen. Schliesslich macht es Sinn, Komponenten für den Einsatz in der Schwerelosigkeit—wie Antennen, Träger, Solarpanelstrukturen, etc.—direkt im Orbit herzustellen, anstatt sie wie bisher für Montage, Lagerung, Demontage und Transport für mindestens 1G auslegen zu müssen. Die Spiderfab-Technologie könnte dementsprechend vor Ort auch Konstruktionen wie z.B. Antennenreflektoren oder Solarpanele ermöglichen, die 10- bis 100-mal so groß sind wie die bisherigen Versionen.\n\nParallel zum NIAC-Vertrag entwickelt Tethers Unlimited ebenfalls für die NASA ein Gerät namens “Trusselator”, das Trägerstrukturen fabrizieren soll, die im Orbit zu großen Solar-Arrays zusammengesetzt werden. Dies soll als Ausgangspunkt für weitere Entwicklungen dienen.\n\nIch finde es toll, wenn Meldungen wie diese zwar noch nach Science Fiction klingen, es aber nicht mehr sind. Vor 10 Jahren war der Zugang zum Weltraum noch Staaten vorenthalten, nicht kommerziell arbeitenden Firmen. Ich bin gespannt, wie weit wir dann 2023 dank [NewSpace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewSpace)-Pionieren wie Tethers Unlimited, SpaceX oder Bigelow Aerospace sind… \\\\o/\n\nQuelle: [Tethers Unlimited](http://www.tethers.com/PR/SpiderFabPh2_PressRelease.pdf), via [Moonandback](http://moonandback.com/2013/09/03/spiderfab-receives-more-support-from-nasa/).\n\n---\n\n## Der Krieg gegen das Altern hat wahrhaftig begonnen\n\nGoogle-Vater [Larry Page hat vor wenigen Tagen die Gründung einer neue Firma namens “Calico” angekündigt](https://plus.google.com/+LarryPage/posts/Lh8SKC6sED1), deren erklärtes Ziel es ist, das menschliche Leben zu verlängern, zu verbessern und die Geheimnisse des Alterns zu entschlüsseln (und ihnen effektiv zu begegnen). Ich will nicht lügen: die Nachricht hat mir Gänsehaut gemacht—aber die gute Art.\n\nMan mag von Google halten, was man will; ich weiss, wie viele meiner Mitbürger reagieren, wenn der Name “Google” fällt. ;) Aber ignorieren wir für einen Moment mal die endlosen Diskussionen um Cookies, Gmail, NSA und Streetview—ich denke, jeder wird zugeben, dass die Firma ungeschlagen darin ist, unfassbar große Datenmengen umfassend, clever und oft in überraschender Weise auszuwerten. Einige der klügsten Köpfe unserer Generationen sind dort beschäftigt; ich sage: lasst sie forschen, auswerten und an den Geheimnissen des menschlichen Körpers arbeiten! Wir können dabei nur gewinnen.\n\n_“Aber warum Google, machen die nicht nur Werbeanzeigen und Email und so?”_ Der Konzern macht damit das Gros seiner Einnahmen, ja, aber seit ein paar Jahren stürzt er sich auch mit großer Energie und oft ebensogroßen Erfolgen auf Bereiche, die nicht soviel mit Ads und Websuche zu tun haben: er entwickelt [selbstfahrende Automobile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_driverless_car) oder auch [Ballon-basierte Internetknoten](http://www.google.com/loon/) für abgelegene Orte auf der Welt. Und ja: sicher wird Google damit auch irgendwann Geld verdienen wollen, aber damit kann ich sehr leben. Sie sind auf ein langes Spiel eingestellt, und akzeptieren, dass die ersten paar Jahre ein Verlustgeschäft sein werden; der Rest von uns bekommt neue Technologien, die großes Potential zur Disruption haben.\n\nZurück zu Calico. Der Traum, älter zu werden als frühere Generationen, er ist so alt wie die Menschheit selbst. Es gibt viele Firmen und Stiftungen, die sich seit Jahrzehnten mit dem Thema beschäftigen, aktiv Forschung betreiben und auch finanzieren. Calico ist also nicht der erste Player in diesem Bereich, wohl aber die erste mit einem derartig starken finanziellen Hintergrund—Google hat mehr Geld als Gott.\n\nDementsprechend groß war die Freude nicht nur bei mir, sondern auch bei bekannten Vertretern der Alterungsforschung: Dr. Aubrey de Grey, biomedizinischer Gerontologe und Chief Science Officer der SENS Foundation, [stellte umgehend fest](http://ideas.time.com/2013/09/18/finally-the-war-on-aging-has-truly-begun-2/) _“Der Krieg gegen das Altern hat wahrhaftig begonnen”_.\n\nHuzzah!\n",

You've been warned.\n\n\n### Base URL\n\n`https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy`\n\n\n### Parameters:\n\n* `url`: original image URL\n* `container`: must be \"focus\" `¯\\_(ツ)_/¯`\n* `refresh`: time (in seconds) to cache it on G's servers\n* `resize_w`: width in pixels\n* `resize_h`: height in pixels\n\nYou can either specify both `resize_*` parameters or just one.\n\n\n### An example\n\nLet's resize [that big 5831×1644 panorama picture I took in Istanbul a while ago](https://files.czm.io/f/blog-istanbul.jpg).\n\n**Make it square, 300x300px and cache it for 30 days:**\n\n![Resized image, 300x300px](https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.czm.io%2Ff%2Fblog-istanbul.jpg&container=focus&resize_w=300&resize_h=300&refresh=2592000)\n\nURL:\n\n    https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.czm.io%2Ff%2Fblog-istanbul.jpg&container=focus&resize_w=300&resize_h=300&refresh=2592000\n\n**Make it 650px wide, keep the aspect ratio and cache the result for a year:**\n\n![Resized image, 650px wide](https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.czm.io%2Ff%2Fblog-istanbul.jpg&container=focus&resize_w=650&refresh=31536000)\n\nURL:\n\n    https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.czm.io%2Ff%2Fblog-istanbul.jpg&container=focus&resize_w=650&refresh=31536000\n\n\n### Quirks\n\nAt least in Chrome, opening the URL in the browser will force the download of a `p.txt` file (which is actually a JPG).  Putting the URL in an `<img>` tag is fine, tho.  Or just use `curl` to save it locally.\n",

The underlying pressure it dishes out in every briefing, the omnipresent feeling of a galaxy at war, of everything being at stake, the loss of Mordin and Legion, the reminiscing with Garrus, later on saying my good-byes to everyone, Liara&rsquo;s gift, Anderson…  all of that hit home, brutally so, again and again.  And the ending (I went with the 3rd option) just fit the overall narrative arc and personality of my Shepard.</p>\n<p>I seldom come across works of art that make me feel that heavy, that weary, that elated, and that misty-eyed, but when I do, I tend revel in those moments.  Beauty doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean constant happiness.</p>\n<p>Thus, I really wonder what people were expecting… a movie blockbuster finish á la ID4, maybe.  I don&rsquo;t know.  Many people didn&rsquo;t like it, then.  I can respect that, as it&rsquo;s definitely not a happy ending.  But <em>people are seriously demanding</em> Bioware has to change the artistic vision of their work?  Give me a fucking break.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>So, why didn&rsquo;t I complain?  Why wasn&rsquo;t I bothered by the supposedly botched finish?</p>\n<p>For starters, I was aware that I was working and acting within the confines of a big, pre-written narrative arc, and so the choices offered were not that …offensive.  I was given the choice between pest, cholera and a (to me) rather acceptable compromise.</p>\n<p>Just like &ldquo;my&rdquo; Shepard I, too, was kind of surprised we got that far, and so I took what I could get.  I mean, Shepard wasn&rsquo;t able to simply will the Reapers away, so he/I was accepting the cards given and going with what he/I had.</p>\n<p>I still don&rsquo;t understand the outrage.  See, at the end of ME1, Sovereign was beaten, yet still most people (in ME&rsquo;s universe) were trying very hard to believe that one single Reaper was just a fluke.

				"content_html": "<p><strong>If you think sexual harassment is acceptable, you&rsquo;re a goddamn idiot.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-03-03-its-time-to-kick-back-against-gaming-bigots\">What the fuck is wrong with that guy?</a></p>\n<p>Quick recap: a few days ago, Capcom held a Street Fighter X Tekken tournament.  It was televised, and showed some of the seedy underbelly of the videogaming community.  There was misogyny, talk of rape, and the declaration that this was entirely acceptable as Street Fighter and sexual harassment are one and the same thing.  Mindblowing.</p>\n<p>But, well, it might be a good thing that Capcom thing exploded like it did.  This filth needs to be dragged into the light.  I have no issues with friendly smack talk between contenders — as long as it&rsquo;s funny to everyone involved.  But that requires some empathy and a feel for the room, so to speak; two traits that  Aris guy seem to lack.  Telling a female player, nay, anyone, <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna rape you, bitch&rdquo;</em> is unacceptable in any given case.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that if you <em>really</em> want to have your heritage, sexuality and race questioned, the fastest way to do that is to just jump into any competitive public online game on Xbox Live.  That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I seldom play online with strangers, and when I do, why I have the voices muted when playing.  But yes, that&rsquo;s akin to looking the other way.  But I&rsquo;ve used both the XBL report and rate features a few times to complain about some fucknuggets hurtling <em>vile</em> insults in my direction just because I managed to hit them in a Halo match.

It was televised, and showed some of the seedy underbelly of the videogaming community.  There was misogyny, talk of rape, and the declaration that this was entirely acceptable as Street Fighter and sexual harassment are one and the same thing.  Mindblowing.\n\nBut, well, it might be a good thing that Capcom thing exploded like it did.  This filth needs to be dragged into the light.  I have no issues with friendly smack talk between contenders — as long as it's funny to everyone involved.  But that requires some empathy and a feel for the room, so to speak; two traits that  Aris guy seem to lack.  Telling a female player, nay, anyone, _\"I'm gonna rape you, bitch\"_ is unacceptable in any given case.\n\nIt's no secret that if you _really_ want to have your heritage, sexuality and race questioned, the fastest way to do that is to just jump into any competitive public online game on Xbox Live.  That's one of the reasons why I seldom play online with strangers, and when I do, why I have the voices muted when playing.  But yes, that's akin to looking the other way.  But I've used both the XBL report and rate features a few times to complain about some fucknuggets hurtling _vile_ insults in my direction just because I managed to hit them in a Halo match.  It's not much, and I really don't know whether anything of that made a difference, but not doing anything would've been even less of an act.\n\nQuite frankly, I've lost all interest in just checking out public/open games on XBL because of that.  And I am a male, white, heterosexual, mid-30s guy who's so far been treated well by the universe.  I'm a large, semi-muscular man, I can take it — but as it turns out, I really don't want to anymore.\n\nAnyway, if you want to read more about these utterly sorry events, [GiantBomb's coverage is good](http://www.giantbomb.com/news/when-passions-flare-lines-are-crossed-updated/4006/).

This doesn&rsquo;t fly.</p>\n<p>Thus, I ended up doing a final export, then writing a custom script utilizing <a href=\"https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text\">html2text</a> which converted the HTML output back to Markdown (while mangling all footnotes — that was fun).

It&rsquo;s a rather opinionated Dropbox-based service.  It&rsquo;ll pick up <code>.md</code>/<code>.rst</code> files in your <code>~/Dropbox/Apps/Calepin/</code> folder, generate a static site and serve that for you from its server (<strong>not</strong> from your Dropbox).</p>\n<p>It is opinionated insofar that it assumes you want to use Markdown, might want to point your readers to your Twitter account, might want to use <a href=\"http://disqus.com/\">Disqus</a> for comments, and might want to use a custom domain name, while being somewhat desinterested in customizing your blog any further.  Which is okay for me, but I&rsquo;m sure it isn&rsquo;t for everyone.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s some bare-bones site configuration available in the form of a <code>settings.json</code> file in the same folder — this is how you tell Calepin which Google Analytics ID or Disqus profile to use, for example.</p>\n<p>When registering and setting up your blog on the site, you can also specify a custom domain to be used (CNAME).</p>\n<p>Pictures and other assets can/should be served from your <code>~/Dropbox/Public/</code> folder.  Clever idea.</p>\n<p>The per-post metadata is something very much like <a href=\"https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/yaml-front-matter\">YAML front matter</a> and can be used to set title, abstract, status, date, slug, category and/or tags.  If you set the <code>Status: draft</code> directive in a post file, the post isn&rsquo;t published.  The slug may contain folder names — for example, <code>Slug: 2012/01/20/zomg</code> will result in the URL <code>[username].calepin.co/2012/01/20/zomg/</code>.  I like that.</p>\n<p>The publish process is triggered by clicking the aptly named &ldquo;Publish&rdquo; button on calepin.co.</p>\n<h3 id=\"but\">But…</h3>\n<p>Calepin is not themeable.  It also lacks support for extra header/footer links, &ldquo;special&rdquo; pages, widgets or doodads (yet?).  For me, that&rsquo;s not a problem (yet?), tho, since I noticed I can get clever using a page&rsquo;s <code>Slug</code> directive.</p>\n<p>(For example, I wanted a &ldquo;Me&rdquo; page: I created a file <code>me.md</code>, then set its slug to &ldquo;me&rdquo; and its post date in the future (so the page will stay at the top of the front page).  For the time being, this works well enough for me.  YMMV.)</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no timezone support yet, at this point all timestamps are UTC.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-future\">The future</h3>\n<p>Calepin&rsquo;s creator, <a href=\"http://jokull.calepin.co/\">Jökull Sólberg Auðunsson</a>, made some statements regarding future features etc. in the comments to the <a href=\"http://jokull.calepin.co/calepin-guide.html\">Calepin Guide</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There might be additional customization options like footer sections or subpages.</li>\n<li>A command-line tool is &ldquo;coming soon&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>Calepin might transform into a freemium/premium service at some point.

Which is okay for me, but I'm sure it isn't for everyone.\n\nThere's some bare-bones site configuration available in the form of a `settings.json` file in the same folder — this is how you tell Calepin which Google Analytics ID or Disqus profile to use, for example.\n\nWhen registering and setting up your blog on the site, you can also specify a custom domain to be used (CNAME).\n\nPictures and other assets can/should be served from your `~/Dropbox/Public/` folder.  Clever idea.\n\nThe per-post metadata is something very much like [YAML front matter][yaml-fm] and can be used to set title, abstract, status, date, slug, category and/or tags.  If you set the `Status: draft` directive in a post file, the post isn't published.  The slug may contain folder names — for example, `Slug: 2012/01/20/zomg` will result in the URL `[username].calepin.co/2012/01/20/zomg/`.  I like that.\n\nThe publish process is triggered by clicking the aptly named \"Publish\" button on calepin.co.\n\n\n### But…\n\nCalepin is not themeable.  It also lacks support for extra header/footer links, \"special\" pages, widgets or doodads (yet?).  For me, that's not a problem (yet?), tho, since I noticed I can get clever using a page's `Slug` directive.\n\n(For example, I wanted a \"Me\" page: I created a file `me.md`, then set its slug to \"me\" and its post date in the future (so the page will stay at the top of the front page).  For the time being, this works well enough for me.  YMMV.)\n\nThere's no timezone support yet, at this point all timestamps are UTC.\n\n\n### The future\n\nCalepin's creator, [Jökull Sólberg Auðunsson][jokull], made some statements regarding future features etc. in the comments to the [Calepin Guide][guide].\n\n* There might be additional customization options like footer sections or subpages.\n* A command-line tool is \"coming soon\".\n* Calepin might transform into a freemium/premium service at some point.  It'll be interesting to follow that development.\n\n\n### And finally…\n\nMy new/old/moved blog is back at [carlo.zottmann.org][blog-new].  This is where it resided back in its Wordpress days (self-hosted), its Tumblr incarnation was located at [blog.zottmann.org][blog-old].\n\nOn a related note, I think [iA Writer][iawriter]'s lack of full Markdown syntax highlighting (for example, for links and italic text) might turn out to annoy me more than I had anticipated.\n\n\n[tumblr-switch]: http://carlo.zottmann.org/2009/10/14/the-big-blog-move-of-2009\n[iawriter]: http://www.iawriter.com/\n[tumblr-exporter]: http://www.tumblr.com/goodies\n[html2text]: https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text\n[jekyll]: http://jekyllrb.com/\n[calepin]: http://calepin.co/\n[disqus]: http://disqus.com/\n[yaml-fm]: https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/yaml-front-matter\n[jokull]: http://jokull.calepin.co/\n[guide]: http://jokull.calepin.co/calepin-guide.html\n[blog-new]: http://carlo.zottmann.org/\n[blog-old]: http://blog.zottmann.org/\n",

[Ich habe mir also ein Profil auf der belgischen Site angelegt][5], da es die einzige europäische Site ist, auf der man a) in Euro spenden kann und die b) englischsprachig ist.\n\nSo, und jetzt kommt Ihr ins Spiel. **Ich würde mich freuen, wenn Ihr für diesen wichtigen, guten Zweck ein paar Euro lockermachen könntet.** Wenn Euch meine enthaarte Gesichtshälfte ebenso schockiert wie meine Frau oder aber genauso erheitert wie mich, **gebt bitte etwas Geld für die Prostata-Krebs-\nForschung. Geht dazu auf [meine Movember-MoBro-Seite][5] und klickt auf den großen \"Donate to me\"-Button** unter meinem noch bärtigen Gesicht. Jeder Euro zählt! Gracias!!!\n\nZum Dank werde ich Euch auch weiterhin mit meinem Würdeverlust unterhalten —\nich werde jeden Tag ein Foto von meiner langsam zurückkehrenden Männlichkeit machen, und diese Fotos alle ein bis zwei Tage veröffentlichen. Falls Euch der Gedanke abschreckt: niemand _muss_ sich diese Bilder anschauen.\n\n![Mir ist kalt.][6]\n\n(Mein Gesicht ist so kalt… Ist das normal?!)\n\nZum Abschluss möchte ich meiner lieben Frau Dana danken, die ihre Unterstützungsbekundung mit den Worten _\"Du weisst schon, dass Du ohne Bart total bescheuert aussiehst, oder?\"_ eingeleitet hat. ;) (Ja, weiss ich.

Fleeing the surprisingly open high-security prison complex without much trouble, he sets out to revive his old gang, the 3rd Street Saints, with some help from old and new friends.</p>\n<p>The story missions are mostly fun and engaging, but not without flaws. Some of the checkpoints had me pull my hair out because they were obviously placed by mad men who hated me personally. Also, there were (very few) occasional glitches, but nothing to lose sleep about. All in all your tasks are fun. So far, so unremarkable on paper.</p>\n<p>Yet I came to really like Saints Row 2 because it&rsquo;s not ashamed of what it is,\nbecause it&rsquo;s not afraid to proudly fly its colors: a game for adults who understand that this &ndash;at its heart&ndash; is pure and unadulterated satire.\nVolition took the basic setting (gang wars in an urban setting) and made it willfully surreal. It&rsquo;s to real, dramatic gang-related stories what <em>Naked Gun</em> was to gritty, hard-hitting detective movies.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>I mean, name another game where you can dress in a pink Borat-style swim suit,\nwearing a traffic cone as hat and space-age biker boots &ndash; and then fly an attack helicopter or conduct &ldquo;business&rdquo; meetings. That alone is an indicator of the level of grit, reality and seriousness Volition had in mind when it made Saints Row. They left the grit and deep story telling to the excellent GTA IV that came after it.</p>\n<p>Take its mini games for example. Like the one involving insurance fraud. And the one about pleasing ladies in seedy locations<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>. And the one about stealing cars. And the one about &ldquo;rescueing&rdquo; other hard-working ladies from their dubious employers. And the one about poopifying<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> parts of the city for money. And the one about ATV-based arson. And the one about running around town butt-nekkid, flashing your pixelated man parts and raking up cash doing so. And many, many more. Most of them are worthwhile, many are so-so, none of them are about making a point in any way &ndash; they&rsquo;re about having fun and making some quick money for your ongoing quest to style your growing number of increasingly elusive cribs in the process, and nothing else.</p>\n<p>So yes, gang warfare. You fight three enemy gangs, the police and a big-ass corporation which owns most of the city. And 99% of the time SR2 successfully manages not to question its playful background. Stilwater is a clear-cut caricature of a sprawling US city. It&rsquo;s incredibly easy to get lost there in the gang-related shenanigans of the main characters there, their almost comical lack of regard for other people&rsquo;s lives and property and the often hilarious mission pieces. It is a game that full-well knows it is a game, that its city is a ludicrous sandbox, and that&rsquo;s not shy to brazenly cater to its select audience, both in and outside of missions.</p>\n<p>Case in point: there is a particular outlandish cutscene after the, let&rsquo;s say,\n&ldquo;forceful eviction&rdquo; of a good number of drifters from the new designated Saints gang hideout. Johnny Gat and the player character sit on a couch,\nbodies strewn all around them &ndash; then they banter and fist-bump, and you were forgiven for thinking they were just like two regular dudes after another day of hard labour if it wasn&rsquo;t for the dead guy in front of the couch they were using to prop up their feet.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m man enough to tell you: yes, I laughed, exactly <em>because</em> it was crazy.\nVolition knew it when they wrote it, I knew it when I saw it, we were sharing a joke there. Was it deep, meaningful high-brow humor? Hell, no. Funny it was nonetheless.</p>\n<p>And while the question of morale is avoided for most of the game, it isn&rsquo;t entirely absent. In one of the final missions there is a dialog between the protagonist and his former leader and mentor, where &ndash;in the last minute of said mentor&rsquo;s life&ndash; they discuss their respective motivations. And while the mentor is trying to talk sense into him, telling him all the violence and death can&rsquo;t go on, the Boss (the player character) all of a sudden spouts: <em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a shit… <strong>I own</strong> this city!&quot;</em>. I applaud <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0789478/\">Charles Shaughnessy</a>\nfor his crackerjack voice work as the Boss<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup> &ndash; in this very moment I came to realize that this character does have his own agenda after all, apart from allowing me to wield him as my chosen tool in the joyful redecoration of entire Stilwater city blocks. He <em>is</em> a ruthless asshole, even if I came to forget that over all the lol&rsquo;ing and giggling in the hours prior. In that dialog his true colors shone through, and though the entire game is basically a huge hedonistic exercise in violent and juvenile humor, the Boss' short monologue gave him quite a bit of added depth &ndash; it hit home for me.</p>\n<p>It was a good, maybe even great moment in an outstandingly insane game. How good? I still remember and think about it, even two months after finishing the game. It managed to give SR2 a slightly different tone that reverberated back from the <em>end</em> of the game through my memories of the whole experience. It wasn&rsquo;t a heavy-handed <em>&ldquo;Gangs are bad, mmkay, kids?&quot;</em>, far from it; again,\nVolition acknowledged its audience, recognized it for what it is &ndash;adults&ndash;\nand gave a little bit of reinforced context to make a subtle point: they know full well <em>what</em> they&rsquo;re making fun of.</p>\n<p>Chapeau.</p>\n<p>So my overall verdict of SR2 is <em>&ldquo;absolutely worth my time&rdquo;</em>. I refuse to hand out arbitrary points or scores for games as that system is bollocks anyways.\nInstead, I&rsquo;ll opt for <a href=\"http://monoxyd.de\">Marcus'</a> scoring scheme which basically asks you what you would be willing to pay for the game once you&rsquo;ve actually played it.\nHow much money do you feel is justified for a copy of this game? For me, the answer is:</p>\n<p><strong>Saints Row 2: €40.</strong></p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>Look it up, kids.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>But you only see said location from the outside, and have to play by ear and gamepad vibration.

It's to real, dramatic gang-related stories what _Naked Gun_ was to gritty, hard-hitting detective movies.[^one]\n\nI mean, name another game where you can dress in a pink Borat-style swim suit,\nwearing a traffic cone as hat and space-age biker boots -- and then fly an attack helicopter or conduct \"business\" meetings. That alone is an indicator of the level of grit, reality and seriousness Volition had in mind when it made Saints Row. They left the grit and deep story telling to the excellent GTA IV that came after it.\n\nTake its mini games for example. Like the one involving insurance fraud. And the one about pleasing ladies in seedy locations[^two]. And the one about stealing cars. And the one about \"rescueing\" other hard-working ladies from their dubious employers. And the one about poopifying[^three] parts of the city for money. And the one about ATV-based arson. And the one about running around town butt-nekkid, flashing your pixelated man parts and raking up cash doing so. And many, many more. Most of them are worthwhile, many are so-so, none of them are about making a point in any way -- they're about having fun and making some quick money for your ongoing quest to style your growing number of increasingly elusive cribs in the process, and nothing else.\n\nSo yes, gang warfare. You fight three enemy gangs, the police and a big-ass corporation which owns most of the city. And 99% of the time SR2 successfully manages not to question its playful background. Stilwater is a clear-cut caricature of a sprawling US city. It's incredibly easy to get lost there in the gang-related shenanigans of the main characters there, their almost comical lack of regard for other people's lives and property and the often hilarious mission pieces. It is a game that full-well knows it is a game, that its city is a ludicrous sandbox, and that's not shy to brazenly cater to its select audience, both in and outside of missions.\n\nCase in point: there is a particular outlandish cutscene after the, let's say,\n\"forceful eviction\" of a good number of drifters from the new designated Saints gang hideout. Johnny Gat and the player character sit on a couch,\nbodies strewn all around them -- then they banter and fist-bump, and you were forgiven for thinking they were just like two regular dudes after another day of hard labour if it wasn't for the dead guy in front of the couch they were using to prop up their feet.\n\nI'm man enough to tell you: yes, I laughed, exactly _because_ it was crazy.\nVolition knew it when they wrote it, I knew it when I saw it, we were sharing a joke there. Was it deep, meaningful high-brow humor? Hell, no. Funny it was nonetheless.\n\nAnd while the question of morale is avoided for most of the game, it isn't entirely absent. In one of the final missions there is a dialog between the protagonist and his former leader and mentor, where --in the last minute of said mentor's life-- they discuss their respective motivations. And while the mentor is trying to talk sense into him, telling him all the violence and death can't go on, the Boss (the player character) all of a sudden spouts: _\"I don't give a shit… **I own** this city!\"_. I applaud [Charles Shaughnessy][7]\nfor his crackerjack voice work as the Boss[^four] -- in this very moment I came to realize that this character does have his own agenda after all, apart from allowing me to wield him as my chosen tool in the joyful redecoration of entire Stilwater city blocks. He _is_ a ruthless asshole, even if I came to forget that over all the lol'ing and giggling in the hours prior. In that dialog his true colors shone through, and though the entire game is basically a huge hedonistic exercise in violent and juvenile humor, the Boss' short monologue gave him quite a bit of added depth -- it hit home for me.\n\nIt was a good, maybe even great moment in an outstandingly insane game. How good? I still remember and think about it, even two months after finishing the game. It managed to give SR2 a slightly different tone that reverberated back from the _end_ of the game through my memories of the whole experience. It wasn't a heavy-handed _\"Gangs are bad, mmkay, kids?\"_, far from it; again,\nVolition acknowledged its audience, recognized it for what it is --adults--\nand gave a little bit of reinforced context to make a subtle point: they know full well _what_ they're making fun of.\n\nChapeau.\n\nSo my overall verdict of SR2 is _\"absolutely worth my time\"_. I refuse to hand out arbitrary points or scores for games as that system is bollocks anyways.\nInstead, I'll opt for [Marcus'][9] scoring scheme which basically asks you what you would be willing to pay for the game once you've actually played it.\nHow much money do you feel is justified for a copy of this game? For me, the answer is:\n\n**Saints Row 2: €40.**\n\n\n[^one]: Look it up, kids.\n\n[^two]: But you only see said location from the outside, and have to play by ear and gamepad vibration. Sorry.\n\n[^three]: Yes, it's a word… now.\n\n[^four]: Why, I picked the English voice for my character. It's got style.\n\n[1]: http://www.giantbomb.com/saints-row-2/61-20679/\n[2]: //attic.czm.io/blog-assets/5762453072_1.jpg\n[3]: http://www.giantbomb.com/saints-row/61-5618/\n[7]: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0789478/\n[9]: http://monoxyd.de\n",

				"content_html": "<h3 id=\"tuesday-april-27-2010\">Tuesday, April 27, 2010</h3>\n<p>Wore my Nike Free yesterday, as they&rsquo;re the most flexible (actual) shoes I own. No time for running, tho, also still some residue muscle pain.</p>\n<p>Today: Beautiful morning, decided to ignore the bus and walk to the subway.\n3.5 km in my Nikes, and while they&rsquo;re pretty good, I miss the ability to wiggle my toes.</p>\n<p>Came home, went for a 3.5 km VFF walk with Dana. My calves seem to man up,\nfinally. With a bit of luck I might be able to go for a run on Thursday again!</p>\n<h3 id=\"wednesday\">Wednesday</h3>\n<p>Came home, my legs still aching a bit, but I thought <em>&ldquo;eh, what the eff&rdquo;</em> and went for a 5 km run. Didn&rsquo;t even take a watch or anything; I just felt like running. The last time this happened to me was never. And I had fun.</p>\n<p>To be honest, the combination of THE BOOK and MY NEW SHOES caused this almost eerie, constant desire to get out and run. I&rsquo;m not making this up; it&rsquo;s uncanny. I&rsquo;ve never had this urge to just crunch some miles. And it&rsquo;s not because of stress at work or anything. I&rsquo;m calm, I&rsquo;m my usual sunny self, not stressed out… It&rsquo;s just a deep-seated feeling that running would be the right thing to do <em>right fucking now</em>. For no apparent reason. (Perhaps they&rsquo;ve put brain-altering chemicals into the book; I don&rsquo;t know… I don&rsquo;t know.)</p>\n<p>And I won&rsquo;t lie, I&rsquo;ll enjoy it for as long as it lasts.

				"content_text": "\n### Tuesday, April 27, 2010\n\nWore my Nike Free yesterday, as they're the most flexible (actual) shoes I own. No time for running, tho, also still some residue muscle pain.\n\nToday: Beautiful morning, decided to ignore the bus and walk to the subway.\n3.5 km in my Nikes, and while they're pretty good, I miss the ability to wiggle my toes.\n\nCame home, went for a 3.5 km VFF walk with Dana. My calves seem to man up,\nfinally. With a bit of luck I might be able to go for a run on Thursday again!\n\n### Wednesday\n\nCame home, my legs still aching a bit, but I thought _\"eh, what the eff\"_ and went for a 5 km run. Didn't even take a watch or anything; I just felt like running. The last time this happened to me was never. And I had fun.\n\nTo be honest, the combination of THE BOOK and MY NEW SHOES caused this almost eerie, constant desire to get out and run. I'm not making this up; it's uncanny. I've never had this urge to just crunch some miles. And it's not because of stress at work or anything. I'm calm, I'm my usual sunny self, not stressed out… It's just a deep-seated feeling that running would be the right thing to do _right fucking now_. For no apparent reason. (Perhaps they've put brain-altering chemicals into the book; I don't know… I don't know.)\n\nAnd I won't lie, I'll enjoy it for as long as it lasts. It might go away tomorrow or next week or in five years time, I don't know, but I'm cool with it. There are worse urges, really.\n\nAlso: I can predict the future! Tomorrow, walking will hurt. (I wish my calves would man up quicker.)\n\n### Thursday\n\nTurns out I can't predict the future after all — I _can_ walk rather painlessly today. Apparently all the extra post-run stretching and muscle rubbing[^one] was a good idea.\n\nHad a discussion with another (ex) Y! about running barefoot'ish. It's not just about not running on your heels, but about foot strength/health in general. In running shoes, the foot's arch is bolstered and propped up to various degrees. And your toes are pretty much suspended. When running without shoes, the arch acts like a spring, and the toes react to the underground, but they can't do that when shod.\n\nThe difference is not just that you're running on your forefeet, it's about giving the foot (and therefore the leg) a chance to work as intended.\n\n### Friday\n\n5 km, 'twas okay — not more, not less. The humidity took me a bit by surprise,\nand my big lunch wasn't helping the cause either. So: eh.\n\nMy lower legs are slowly adjusting to the change. Atta boys!\n\nOne of the Vibrams is slowly coming apart a bit at the heel (where the mesh is glued to the rubber \"skin\"), which is a bit strange after only one week of moderate use. They're not falling apart or anything, their function isn't impaired, it's just a visible \"glitch\" I'm not too happy with. They're one week old after all.\n\nI'll hit the sports store on Monday and ask for either a replacement or (some)\nmoney back.\n\n### Saturday, Sunday\n\nRest of the week were wasted on shitty weather and/or me freezing, so no running.\n\n\n[^one]: Not an euphemism, thankyouverymuch.\n",

				"content_text": "\n_This post references [MacRuby][1] 0.5, used with Xcode 3.2 on Snopard\n(10.6.2); the general technique will likely work on other OS/Xcode version,\ntho. Just saying._\n\nAt some point in [my project][2] I needed to access OSX' Keychain to store sensitive userdata. Unfortunately, due to the lack of void pointers in MacRuby 0.5 (see [Trac ticket][3]), I couldn't use standard methods like\n[`SecKeychainAddGenericPassword`][4]. The guys on [the mailing list][5] told me to use a wrapper instead. Doing some reading and poking around the interwebs I finally figured it out, and since it's a neat trick I thought I'd scribble it down, so maybe it will safe someone in a position like me a bit of time. ;)\n\nI've decided to go with [ExtendMac's EMKeychain class][6] because it's simple,\nclean, free and has a liberal license (MIT license, if I'm not mistaken).\n\n**Disclaimer: I'm not a Obj-C person, and what you're about to read is what works for me. I've tinkered until everything was moving in the right direction. There might be better ways (I'm pretty sure there are), and if what I've done here is bollocks, I'd be delighted if you would share your knowledge with me. :)** Also, I'd enjoy a comment with your thoughts about this here article. Any opinion will do. Just curious is all.\n\n\n### Step 1: Build the wrapper, `EMKeychain.dylib`\n\nFirst, we'll have to make EMKeychain into a dynamic library. Download it from the site, unzip it, and fire up Xcode. There, start a new project of the type\n\"Cocoa Library\".\n\n![Starting a new project of the type \"Cocoa Library\"][7]\n\nWhen asked for the name, call it \"EMKeychain\". It kind of makes sense. This is what you'll end up with:\n\n![New project view][8]\n\nIn the screenshot you'll notice a file called `EMKeychain_Prefix.pch`. That's a so-called \"precompiled header\"; Xcode creates it automatically for you on project creation.\n\nNext, add the files `EMKeychain.m` and `EMKeychain.h` to your project by dragging them from the download folder to the \"Classes\" folder.\n\n![Two files added to the project][9]\n\nSince the EMKeychain documentation said the class needs to be linked against Carbon and Security frameworks, do that by right-clicking on the \"Linked Frameworks\" folder in the tree and selecting _Add Existing Frameworks…_:\n\n![The linked frameworks show up in my project][10]\n\nFollowing the related [MacRuby tutorial][11]'s advice, add a constructor to the end of `EMKeychain.m`:\n\n    void Init_EMKeychain(void) { }\n\nNext, adjust the build settings -- switch the base SDK to 10.5…\n\n![Base SDK set][12]\n\n… and enable GC.\n\n![GC enabled][13]\n\nBuild a release, and you'll have your wrapper.\n\n\n### Step 2: Using it\n\nNow for the fun part.\n\n1. Add the just built `EMKeychain.dylib` to your MacRuby project. (Don't forget to copy the file over.)\n2. Add `EMKeychain.dylib` to _Targets ➔ [project name] ➔ Copy Bundle Resources_.\n\nAnd that's it. **If all went well, you should now be able to use EMKeychain's\n`EMGenericKeychainItem`.**\n\n\n### Step 3: Mopping up\n\nIt's very likely that when running your release build it'll crash and burn and complain about a missing `/usr/lib/EMKeychain.dylib`. In this case, you'll have to adjust the built executable accordingly using\n[`install_name_tool`][14].\n\nYou can do that by adding a new _Run Script_ build phase to the target, which should contain this code.\n\n    install_name_tool -change /usr/lib/EMKeychain.dylib \\\n    \"@executable_path/../Resources/EMKeychain.dylib\" \\\n    \"$TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$PROJECT_NAME.app/Contents/MacOS/$PROJECT_NAME\"\n\nIt's possible that on the next build the executable will mope about a missing\n`/usr/local/lib/EMKeychain.dylib` now. Duplicate the snippet and adjust the second one accordingly.\n\n\n### Step 4: Get yourself a beer\n\nBecause if all went according to plan, you're done. :)\n\n[1]: http://macruby.org\n[2]: http://goephemera.com/\n[3]: http://www.macruby.org/trac/ticket/573\n[4]: http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/DOCUMENTATION/Security/Reference/keychainservices/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/SecKeychainAddGenericPassword\n[5]: http://www.mail-archive.com/macruby-devel@lists.macosforge.org/info.html\n[6]: http://extendmac.com/EMKeychain/\n[7]: //attic.czm.io/blog-assets/370827421_1.png\n[8]: //attic.czm.io/blog-assets/370827421_2.png\n[9]: //attic.czm.io/blog-assets/370827421_3.png\n[10]: //attic.czm.io/blog-assets/370827421_4.png\n[11]: http://www.macruby.org/recipes/create-an-objective-c-bundle.html\n[12]: //attic.czm.io/blog-assets/370827421_5.png\n[13]: //attic.czm.io/blog-assets/370827421_6.png\n[14]: http://developer.apple.com/Mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/install_name_tool.1.html\n",

				"title": "City At World's End, 58 Years Later",
				"content_html": "<p>A while ago I&rsquo;ve decided to do a little time travelling. In literature, that is. So I&rsquo;ve picked up a novel called <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/641633.City_at_World_s_End\">&ldquo;City At World&rsquo;s End&rdquo;</a>, written by one <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Hamilton\">Edmond Hamilton</a>. It&rsquo;s a story about a little rural community in the US heartland having a &ldquo;super-atomic bomb&rdquo; go off above it, causing a rift in time, catapulting said city into the far future, and the fight of its citizens to remain on Earth. Adventure!<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/234303270_1.png\" alt=\"&ldquo;City At World&rsquo;s End&rdquo; cover\"></p>\n<p>It is exactly what it sounds like: pure pulp. The characters are rather flat;\nthe premise is unintentionally hilarious. Yet, it&rsquo;s a pretty charming read. :)</p>\n<p>When I&rsquo;ve picked the book up at <a href=\"http://feedbooks.com/book/2357\">feedbooks.com</a>, I had a hunch about what I was getting myself into. After all, this novel is (at the time of this writing) <em>58 years</em> old. That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s from 1951. But I&rsquo;ve chosen the book for exactly that reason (also I was told it had spaceships) — I wanted to know what successful scifi was like in the 50&rsquo;s of the last century. From their point of view, I&rsquo;d probably be like one of them &ldquo;space folks&rdquo;.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> But how would I end up thinking about their view of the future? How would I end up describing their vision of the times to come?</p>\n<p>Turns out I&rsquo;d only use one word, as before: &ldquo;charming&rdquo;.

				"content_text": "\nA while ago I've decided to do a little time travelling. In literature, that is. So I've picked up a novel called [\"City At World's End\"][1], written by one [Edmond Hamilton][2]. It's a story about a little rural community in the US heartland having a \"super-atomic bomb\" go off above it, causing a rift in time, catapulting said city into the far future, and the fight of its citizens to remain on Earth. Adventure![^one]\n\n![\"City At World's End\" cover](//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/234303270_1.png)\n\nIt is exactly what it sounds like: pure pulp. The characters are rather flat;\nthe premise is unintentionally hilarious. Yet, it's a pretty charming read. :)\n\nWhen I've picked the book up at [feedbooks.com][5], I had a hunch about what I was getting myself into. After all, this novel is (at the time of this writing) _58 years_ old. That's right, it's from 1951. But I've chosen the book for exactly that reason (also I was told it had spaceships) — I wanted to know what successful scifi was like in the 50's of the last century. From their point of view, I'd probably be like one of them \"space folks\".[^two] But how would I end up thinking about their view of the future? How would I end up describing their vision of the times to come?\n\nTurns out I'd only use one word, as before: \"charming\". Well, that and \"a bit naïve\". :)\n\nAn example. Said rural community, called Middletown, leaps one million years into the future. One _million_ years! The sun is dying, the Earth is cold,\nmankind has spread across the galaxy… yet all humans they meet are still ordinary humans like you or me.[^three] Given that the first homo sapiens entered the stage just around 400.000 years ago, one would expect meeting rather different beings after another 1.000.000 years. Apparently, evolution took a break or something.\n\nBut at least there are aliens! One of them is Chewbacca. No, I'm not making that up. There's a Capellan (i.e. an alien from Capella) whose description is pretty much 100% Chewbacca. He's big, hairy, ape-like, friendly, loyal and a very good engineer. His name is Gorr Holl. — I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE, GEORGE LUCAS.\n\nThen there are the communications. People tend to park their spaceships just out of town (they have spaceships!), yet someone forgot to invent the walkie-\ntalkies, because there's still a lot of people running back and forth, waving and yelling to alarm the others.\n\nAlso, the space-age people from one million years in the future are familiar with Einstein.

Looking good. Can't say more due to the NDA. :)\n\nThe rest seems to be fine. Standing out most:\n\n* Booting the iMac seems to be faster now.\n* Image Capture finally recognizes my CanoScan LiDE 200 scanner out of the box! (About time.)\n\nAll in all, not a bad update. The family license goes for €49, so I didn't have to think long about it.\n\n**Update:** I was able to fix the keyboard problem! Today I found [Ukulele][8], an Unicode keyboard layout editor. After downloading it, I've poked around the DMG and found two files, `LogitechGerman.keylayout` and `LogitechGerman.icns`. After copying them to the `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`, all that was left was opening the _Language & Text_ preference pane and activating the \"Logitech German\" layout.

Imprints have vaporized, layoffs have begun,\nand it’s better-than-even odds that a number of authors and books are going to get shaved off of publishing lists. 2009 is also likely to be a singularly lousy time to be an aspiring debut author, as publishing houses consolidate their lists and focus their resources on established avenues (i.e., spend their money on people who are already bestsellers) rather than seeking out new folks. Basically, life&rsquo;s gonna suck in publishing for the next year or possibly two.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I love my ebook reader (<a href=\"http://www.lexcycle.com/\">Stanza on the iPod</a> as you can&rsquo;t get the Kindle here in Germany yet), and I&rsquo;d like to buy more ebooks. It&rsquo;s a distribution channel which (I think) would be a pretty good way for the publishers to make additional money …if many of these files wouldn&rsquo;t cost me as much or more than the dead-tree versions.</p>\n<p>I mean, really: I like good novels as much as the next guy, and I am definitely willing to spend money on them. Also, I don&rsquo;t like hardcovers for the price tags (yes, I think $25 is a lot of money). One would think that a digital version would cost substantially less than the hardcover, but it’s not always the case.

				"content_text": "\n[John Scalzi][1]:\n\n> That said, these are gruesome times for publishing, and a lot of folks are not as well-positioned as I am. Imprints have vaporized, layoffs have begun,\nand it’s better-than-even odds that a number of authors and books are going to get shaved off of publishing lists. 2009 is also likely to be a singularly lousy time to be an aspiring debut author, as publishing houses consolidate their lists and focus their resources on established avenues (i.e., spend their money on people who are already bestsellers) rather than seeking out new folks. Basically, life's gonna suck in publishing for the next year or possibly two.\n\nI love my ebook reader ([Stanza on the iPod][2] as you can't get the Kindle here in Germany yet), and I'd like to buy more ebooks. It's a distribution channel which (I think) would be a pretty good way for the publishers to make additional money …if many of these files wouldn't cost me as much or more than the dead-tree versions.\n\nI mean, really: I like good novels as much as the next guy, and I am definitely willing to spend money on them. Also, I don't like hardcovers for the price tags (yes, I think $25 is a lot of money). One would think that a digital version would cost substantially less than the hardcover, but it’s not always the case. Case in point: [\"Zoe's Tale\" by John Scalzi][3], currently on sale for $25 (ebook, FictionWise) and $17 (hardcover, Amazon).\n\nI have no problems with paying $7 or $8 for an ebook, but anything over $10 is highway robbery.\n\nDo not misunderstand me: yes, I am tempted to buy it, but I will fight the urge, because quite frankly, John's a great writer, and I enjoy his novels _very, very much_. Also, I don't think he's the one dictating the price — so who's responsible for these insane prices which seriously keep me from spending money?\n\n(BTW: Yes, you might say _\"get the paperback\"_, but this is not my point. My point is: I _want_ the digital edition, because it's the version I prefer for various reasons.)\n\nAnyways, I believe right now the publishing industry is facing the same problems as the music industry — they’re shooting themselves in the foot because they are either ignoring the possibilities of using a great distribution channel or actively sabotaging it by asking for completely disproportionate amounts of money.\n\nAngry Carlo is angry.\n\n(This is a slightly longer repost of [a comment I've left on Whatever][4].\nAfter posting I wanted to make some clarifications, but couldn't edit the comment, so here we go.)\n\n[1]: http://whatever.scalzi.com/2008/12/04/publishing-asks-why-it-is-in-a-rapidly-descending-handbasket/\n[2]: http://www.lexcycle.com/\n[3]: http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook72256.htm\n[4]: http://whatever.scalzi.com/2008/12/04/publishing-asks-why-it-is-in-a-rapidly-descending-handbasket/#comment-121363\n",

				"content_html": "<p>During the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve built a couple of pipes I want to share.\n(&ldquo;Pipe&rdquo;, in this context, means an application built in <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com\">Yahoo! Pipes</a>.)</p>\n<p><img src=\"//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2007/02/logo-lg.gif\" alt=\"\" title=\"Yahoo! Pipes logo\"> Here&rsquo;s one of them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"your-most-recent-nike-run\">Your Most Recent Nike+ Run</h3>\n<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned <a href=\"http://carlo.zottmann.org/tag/running.html\">once or twice in the past</a>, I&rsquo;ve become a more or less avid runner during the last year. One central piece of my equipment is my\n<a href=\"http://carlo.zottmann.org/2008/05/04/still-running-april-2008/\">Nike+</a>. I don&rsquo;t run without it. I am a geek, I love numbers. The Nike+\nprovides me with numbers. It makes running a game.</p>\n<p>I sync my iPod with my iTunes after each run, and the <a href=\"http://nikeplus.nike.com\">Nike site</a> is taking the raw data, crunching it, giving me graphs and more numbers, and (this is the interesting thing) badges for my website.</p>\n<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t really care about those. But when there are badges, there must be an API which provides the raw data to them. Looking behind the scenes, I quickly found it. It&rsquo;s not password-protected or secured in any way; when you set your nikeplus.nike.com profile to &ldquo;public&rdquo;, the API will return some of your data (run overviews, run details etc. &ndash; no personal details).</p>\n<p><img src=\"//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/05/nikeplus.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Nike+ package\"> So, knowing the API URL, I&rsquo;ve built a pipe which will do a few things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Accept any nikeplus.nike.com &ldquo;brag&rdquo;-type of link as parameter (when you&rsquo;re logged in to the site, these are usually labelled &ldquo;Share with your friends&rdquo;, &ldquo;Grab the link&rdquo; etc.).</li>\n<li>It will extract your public, numeric runner ID from this link.</li>\n<li>It&rsquo;ll fetch the data for the most recent run of the runner with this ID, i.e. you.</li>\n<li>It&rsquo;ll build an RSS feed with the data of your most recent run.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When writing the pipe, I&rsquo;ve made a few assumptions, namely that…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you sync your iPod after each run</li>\n<li>you&rsquo;re using the Nike+ site</li>\n<li>you don&rsquo;t run more than once per day.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since I am lazy, I&rsquo;ll only use the data for the most recent run, so the pipe&rsquo;s results will be exactly that &ndash; just a single item, your most recent run.</p>\n<p>That being said, I found this sufficient. After adding the pipe&rsquo;s RSS URL as new &ldquo;Custom RSS&rdquo;-type service to Friendfeed, FF will effectively trigger the pipe a few times each day, and your latest run will be added to your stream quickly.

				"content_text": "\nDuring the last few weeks, I've built a couple of pipes I want to share.\n(\"Pipe\", in this context, means an application built in [Yahoo! Pipes][1].)\n\n![][2] Here's one of them.\n\n### Your Most Recent Nike+ Run\n\nAs I've mentioned [once or twice in the past][3], I've become a more or less avid runner during the last year. One central piece of my equipment is my\n[Nike+][4]. I don't run without it. I am a geek, I love numbers. The Nike+\nprovides me with numbers. It makes running a game.\n\nI sync my iPod with my iTunes after each run, and the [Nike site][5] is taking the raw data, crunching it, giving me graphs and more numbers, and (this is the interesting thing) badges for my website.\n\nNow, I don't really care about those. But when there are badges, there must be an API which provides the raw data to them. Looking behind the scenes, I quickly found it. It's not password-protected or secured in any way; when you set your nikeplus.nike.com profile to \"public\", the API will return some of your data (run overviews, run details etc. -- no personal details).\n\n![][6] So, knowing the API URL, I've built a pipe which will do a few things:\n\n1. Accept any nikeplus.nike.com \"brag\"-type of link as parameter (when you're logged in to the site, these are usually labelled \"Share with your friends\", \"Grab the link\" etc.).\n2. It will extract your public, numeric runner ID from this link.\n3. It'll fetch the data for the most recent run of the runner with this ID, i.e. you.\n4. It'll build an RSS feed with the data of your most recent run.\n\nWhen writing the pipe, I've made a few assumptions, namely that…\n\n* you sync your iPod after each run\n* you're using the Nike+ site\n* you don't run more than once per day.\n\nSince I am lazy, I'll only use the data for the most recent run, so the pipe's results will be exactly that -- just a single item, your most recent run.\n\nThat being said, I found this sufficient. After adding the pipe's RSS URL as new \"Custom RSS\"-type service to Friendfeed, FF will effectively trigger the pipe a few times each day, and your latest run will be added to your stream quickly. Next time you sync your iPod, the Nike site will pick up the new data, the API will return the new data to the pipe, and the new run will be added as new Friendfeed item.\n\nThe pipe will post your runs in the following format: \"_[Nike+ runner name]_ ran _[distance]_ _[km/mi]_ in _[time]_\", for example \"3R ran 11.3543 km in 1:03'54\"\". The message will link to the public page of the run -- a page [like this][7]. (3R is my Nike+ moniker.)\n\nNow, why would I want to add my runs to Friendfeed? Well, why not? For me,\nrunning is a nice part of my life. I'm actually enjoying it, I'm keeping it casual, and I am proud of every damn kilometer mark I pass. Plus, as mentioned, I am a geek, and I like to share what I build. :)\n\nIf you have questions or suggestions, speak your mind in the comments.\n\n* Yahoo!

				"content_html": "<hr>\n<p>(This is a rather long piece. It has a point, though… so please bear with me.\nDanke.)</p>\n<p>During the last couple of months I&rsquo;ve developed an increasing interest in the US elections. More or less closely following the news about them, scrutinizing and evaluating their talking points and ideas, I&rsquo;ve become rather familiar with both candidates, formed an opinion &ndash; slowly realizing that I am actually more interested in the politics of a country I don&rsquo;t live in and an electorate system I can neither influence nor participate in than in my own nation&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>Allow me to elaborate how I came to care about domestic US politics.</p>\n<p>A couple of years ago, on a sunny day in September, I was sitting in my office working, when a friend pinged me and told me to turn on the TV, <em>now</em>. A few fanatics had hijacked several passenger planes, using them as weapons. We sat in front of the screen, staring in horror at the looped footage, and couldn&rsquo;t believe our eyes. I remember very clearly turning to my coworkers, telling them that it was very likely we were witnessing the first day of World War III; someone had just attacked one of the most gung-ho empires of the World (no offense) &ndash; this was bound to have long-lasting repercussions. No-one would or could expect the USA to take this lying down. I was expecting to see the US military turning some small part of the globe into a glassed parking lot.</p>\n<p>I remember this fear. It was a deep-seated worry for the World as a whole, as <em>meta</em> as this may sound.</p>\n<p>I spent the next few months watching news from the United States very closely. The increase in domestic security, the preparations for the war, the passing of the Patriot Act &ndash; to me, the country resembled a wounded predator; maddened by pain, yet ready to throw itself against the ghostly attacker, lusting for the kill. Pretty much everything I heard in terms of news, speeches and sound bites, was not very rational.</p>\n<p>Quite frankly, it scared the living shit out of me.</p>\n<p>Trying my best to cope with this feeling of terror building up inside of me, I started to look for more reasonable voices from the &ldquo;inside&rdquo;. Surely all the hate mongering and Giuliani&rsquo;esque approaches to making statements<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> couldn&rsquo;t be the whole of it. Someone had to remember there is more to any issue than just black and white! But there was all this <em>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not with us, you&rsquo;re against us&rdquo;</em> madness coming from the US government, and it was not just freaking me out &ndash; I found it highly insulting to the rest of mankind, because it was clearly implying the other nations were either not sympathetic or not interested or just too stupid to come to their own conclusions.</p>\n<p>So… There must be some voices of reason, no? Still shaken I started to dig deeper, ignoring the main media outlets, looking for something that could rejuvenate my opinion that not all of the USA had gone mad with pain.</p>\n<p>To make it short: yes, I found them. Which was a great relief, because it gave me back my hope that logic and reason might prevail in the long run. I stuck to some of these newfound sources; I read a number of political blogs, for example, and I watch the fine offerings in political satire by your own Comedy Channel.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Fast forward to the 2004 US elections.</p>\n<p>Well. We all know how that turned out. Speechless and highly disgusted I witnessed the shit slinging of the &ldquo;friends&rdquo; of the Republican candidate; the despicable and dishonorable <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_Boat_Veterans_For_Truth\">&ldquo;Swift Boat Veterans For Truth&rdquo;</a> campaign being just the tip of the iceberg.</p>\n<p>No matter what you may think about 2004 Democratic presidential candidate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry\">John Kerry</a> &ndash; he was a man fighting for his country in a war he didn&rsquo;t start, apparently committing acts of bravery, saving his comrade&rsquo;s lives, and many people took a piss at that. The 2008 version of this would be claiming John McCain was merely taking a vacation back in Vietnam, or running a brothel in Hanoi &ndash; this would be wrong, both in a factual and moral sense, and the Republicans would hang you in the middle of the Washington Mall.</p>\n<p>So, how could this happen?! How could this <em>possibly</em> work out for the Republican side?</p>\n<p>Anyways… I&rsquo;ve already mentioned my disbelief and disgust. Still highly worried about the state of the Union.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Fast forward again: September 2008.</p>\n<p>The last few years have been less than optimal for the World. I don&rsquo;t say all of it is the fault of the United States; far from it. But when you have one of the major players acts like he owns the place and gives a flying fuck about everyone else, it&rsquo;s bound to cause problems. (To be fair, many of the others aren&rsquo;t much better, tho.) I am very sure many things could have turned out better had more diplomatic, subtle and less arrogant paths been taken.</p>\n<p>And the US is still scares me. The reason for my being afraid has changed, though. Since 2001, many things have been going down the drain, both inside and outside the country, fundamentalism is on the rise, and many people acting highly erratic.</p>\n<p>If anything, the World is more complex now, yet the government of one of the most influential nations on this planet is busy trying to &ldquo;secure the borders&rdquo; and beating its chest, trying to intimidate other countries and ignoring global problems.</p>\n<p>And they continue to claim the position of &ldquo;global leadership&rdquo; without actually leading.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>This time around, in the presidential race is between a 72 year old and a 47 year old man. Here&rsquo;s my rundown from the outside.</p>\n<p>The former has a lot of experience in the inner workings of Washington, D.C., agrees with most things still-president Bush has said and done, and doesn&rsquo;t know how many houses he owns. I&rsquo;ve seen him in interviews a few years ago, and he seemed decent and honest enough. I liked the old John McCain better than the new &ldquo;100% P.O.W.!&rdquo; version; obviously his strategists have decided that having him retell his prison years over and over again is policy enough. Which I find a bit sad since it reduces his whole life and accomplishments to those 5 years in a Vietnam prison; on top of that, in the current context, it&rsquo;s just political fluff. He is very vague about what he&rsquo;s planning to do should he end up being elected. Topics like the fight against poverty (both domestic and global) and climate change are marginalized points of his campaign, at best.</p>\n<p>The latter has not as much Washington experience, but spent a good amount of his years working for the disenfranchised, is a professor in constitutional law, and seems to rather spend his time talking with people and about actual issues (like fighting poverty or climate change), while refusing to return the slander thrown at him by his opponents.</p>\n<p>And they are doing it again. They mock his work as community organizer, which in my book is something that you couldn&rsquo;t disagree with by any standards. It&rsquo;s basically one of the Christian virtues &ndash; <em>I</em> know that, and I am an agnostic. Why do these self-proclaimed Christians mock somebody for showing compassion? What is wrong with these people?</p>\n<p>It pains me to witness hypocrisy on such a scale.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/2018-11-obama-badge.jpg\" alt=\"Obama &lsquo;08 badge\"></p>\n<p>So why do I, a German in Germany, root for Barack Obama?</p>\n<p>Because the World is a closed system. While I don&rsquo;t believe in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_Effect\">Butterfly Effect</a>, I strongly believe in setting a higher or lower standard for yourself and thereby giving others the idea to follow suit. Leading &ndash;or failing&ndash; by example. What works for small groups will work on a global level as well.</p>\n<p><em>A change in leadership in any bigger country in the World will indirectly have an effect on me. This is why I care.</em> (Some issues are more important than others, of course.)</p>\n<p>So I was very, very delighted to hear a presidential candidate of one of the biggest countries in the World stand up and say: <em>&ldquo;These are the problems. Denial doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. Listen, I have kids, so do you, so we&rsquo;ll better fix this shit for their sake &ndash; and here&rsquo;s a rather detailed plan.&quot;</em><sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>Yes, I feel strongly about the impending climate change. Everyone should. We are talking about man&rsquo;s homestead among the stars. This is our house. Our <em>only</em> house. If we burn this place down, then we&rsquo;re truly, really, utterly fucked. I am puzzled why anyone would hesitate talking or thinking about it, let alone working on preventing it or slowing it down. These people are delusional idiots.</p>\n<p>Please take a minute to compare both <a href=\"http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/newenergy\">Obama&rsquo;s page on fighting climate change</a> and <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/climatechange/\">McCain&rsquo;s page</a>. One is a finely formulated plan which gives the impressions people thought about and discussed it at length; the other is a rephrased version of <em>&ldquo;Someone should do something at some point in time …oh look, an adorable kitten&rdquo;</em> an intern was asked to put up so the number of 404 errors in the log files would go down.</p>\n<p>(On a related note: let&rsquo;s assume Senator McCain actually believes in climate change and the need to do something about it &ndash; the man is still 72 years old. I wish him a long life, but statistically speaking, chances are much higher that he&rsquo;ll die a natural death within the next four years than someone who is 25 years younger. Should he die in office, we&rsquo;d <em>all</em> end up with an US president who doesn&rsquo;t believe in man-made climate change. That&rsquo;s basically what we have already.)</p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/home_en.htm\">the European Union is working on fighting climate change</a>, too. Yes, <a href=\"http://carlo.zottmann.org/2007/06/07/madrid-or-why-were-all-doomed/\">not all EU countries are good at it.</a> But I am proud to say <a href=\"http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_6516/Content/EN/Artikel/2007/08/2007-08-24-meseberg-klimaschutz__en.html\">my government seems to care</a>. Still, the EU is just <em>one</em> major player, and a bit limited due to its internal structure. The more big players stop with the lip service and start actually working on it, the better.</p>\n<p>So, to sum up:</p>\n<p>There are two candidates in the current US presidential election cycle. I believe both are decent and honest men. It&rsquo;s just that one of them seems to care about the actual issues (both domestically and globally), appears to have the fundamental understanding of what&rsquo;s going on in the World, and the right mind set to actually get to work.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think Barack Obama is the second coming of Jesus. That thought is ridiculous. I think he&rsquo;s just a guy with the right ideas. I also think under his leadership the US would ask more of the EU, which is fine with me. I prefer a real, actual partnership over the <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re heading this way, just follow, suckers&rdquo;</em> methods of the past.</p>\n<p>It is my belief that he (working with his VP) has the potential and tenacity to not only nudge the World in the right direction, but to restore the moral standing of the USA &ndash; and to have everyone calm down again. It is my belief that others will follow.</p>\n<p>This is the 21st century. I&rsquo;d really see the US move forward again, for it would actually help the World as a whole.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Well.</p>\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re an US citizen, come November, I&rsquo;d like to ask you to make a choice based on logic.</p>\n<p>Please, keep the big picture in mind.</p>\n<p>Please, do not get fooled by the sepia-tinted pictures of the good old, simpler, imaginary times in small town America.</p>\n<p>Please, use your right to vote.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p><em>&ldquo;Eat your broccoli! …9/11.&quot;</em>  Well.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>Paraphrased.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>A couple of weeks ago (mid-June) I’ve participated in our internal <a href=\"http://yahoo.com/\">Yahoo!</a>\nEU Hack Day. This time around I’ve decided to tinker with <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/searchmonkey/\">Yahoo!\nSearchMonkey</a> by building a couple of modules (dubbed SearchMonkey apps)\nduring the 24 hours available.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/07/sm_logo.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Yahoo! SearchMonkey logo\">In case you have never heard about SearchMonkey: it’s a technology built into <a href=\"http://search.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo! Search</a> that allows developers to present their own or other peoples’ sites in a different way (examples to follow). These search result augmentations are dubbed “SearchMonkey apps”.</p>\n<p>The Search users then have the option to use the SearchMonkey apps they like,\nwhich enhances their search results by presenting them in a different way;\nreview sites for example might present their articles in a way that includes the rating or verdict of the reviewed item. There is a good number of different apps available at the <a href=\"http://gallery.search.yahoo.com/\">SearchMonkey Apps Gallery</a>.</p>\n<p>Using SearchMonkey doesn’t influence the ranking or the order of the results;\nit displays the results in the same order, just differently.</p>\n<p>Anyways. I ended up writing 6 apps, and most of them I’d like to share. For more information about a particular app, just click the links. They’ll take you to the related Gallery listing, where you’ll have the option to enable the app for your searches.</p>\n<h3 id=\"twitter-profiles6\"><a href=\"http://gallery.search.yahoo.com/application?smid=PH3.s\">Twitter Profiles</a></h3>\n<p>Whenever a Twitter profile turns up in your search, you’ll get a bit more information about the person—number of followers, number of people followed,\nname, bio, location, last tweet. like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/07/image.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>By the way, it doesn’t query the Twitter API; instead it just grabs the HTML page and extracts the publicly available information.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve <a href=\"http://gallery.search.yahoo.com/application?smid=PH3.s\">visited the Gallery page and installed it</a>, try a <a href=\"http://uk.search.yahoo.com/search?p=twitter+carlo\">Yahoo!

				"content_text": "\nA couple of weeks ago (mid-June) I’ve participated in our internal [Yahoo!][1]\nEU Hack Day. This time around I’ve decided to tinker with [Yahoo!\nSearchMonkey][2] by building a couple of modules (dubbed SearchMonkey apps)\nduring the 24 hours available.\n\n![][3]In case you have never heard about SearchMonkey: it’s a technology built into [Yahoo! Search][4] that allows developers to present their own or other peoples’ sites in a different way (examples to follow). These search result augmentations are dubbed “SearchMonkey apps”.\n\nThe Search users then have the option to use the SearchMonkey apps they like,\nwhich enhances their search results by presenting them in a different way;\nreview sites for example might present their articles in a way that includes the rating or verdict of the reviewed item. There is a good number of different apps available at the [SearchMonkey Apps Gallery][5].\n\nUsing SearchMonkey doesn’t influence the ranking or the order of the results;\nit displays the results in the same order, just differently.\n\nAnyways. I ended up writing 6 apps, and most of them I’d like to share. For more information about a particular app, just click the links. They’ll take you to the related Gallery listing, where you’ll have the option to enable the app for your searches.\n\n### [Twitter Profiles][6]\n\nWhenever a Twitter profile turns up in your search, you’ll get a bit more information about the person—number of followers, number of people followed,\nname, bio, location, last tweet. like this:\n\n![][7]\n\nBy the way, it doesn’t query the Twitter API; instead it just grabs the HTML page and extracts the publicly available information.\n\nOnce you’ve [visited the Gallery page and installed it][6], try a [Yahoo! UK example query][8] to see it in action.\n\n(On a related note, there’s apparently [another Twitter SearchMonkey app][9],\nbut I couldn’t find the installation link to give it a try. Bart, the developer, does things in a more complex and probably more fail-safe way; in my defense, I wanted to keep it simple.)\n\n### [Wikipedia Quick Lookup][10]\n\nIf a Wikipedia article is found, the app will show you its first paragraph and, if available, a thumbnail of the first image. Also the category:\n\n![][11]\n\nOnce you’ve [visited the Gallery page and installed it][10], try a [Yahoo! UK example query][12] to see it in action.\n\n### [Xing Profiles][13]\n\n[Xing][14] is a more Europe-centric [LinkedIn][15] contender. It’s big in Germany. If a Xing person is found, the app shows the mugshot, the location,\nthe title and the industry. Unfortunately Xing doesn’t reveal the company on public profiles unless you’re logged in, which my SM app clearly is not.\nStill:\n\n![][16]\n\nOnce you’ve [visited the Gallery page and installed it][13], try a [Yahoo! UK example query][17] to see it in action.\n\n### [Vox Profiles][18]\n\nIn a desperate attempt to suck up to [Anil Dash][19] (I kid) I’ve hacked together a module to show the profile of any Vox blogger when a related page is found:\n\n![][20]\n\nOnce you’ve [visited the Gallery page and installed it][18], try a [Yahoo! UK example query][21] to see it in action.\n\n### [TechCrunch / Valleywag summaries][22]\n\nUsing cutting edge high tech web 3.0 algorithms straight out of Munich,\nGermany, this module is able to extract the gist of any given Techcrunch or Valleywag article.\n\n![][23]\n\nI don’t like these sites very much. At least their Yahoo! coverage (which I am interested in, given [my background][24]) is usually hysterical and often times sensationalist. DO. NOT. WANT.\n\nOnce you’ve [visited the Gallery page and installed it][22], try a [Yahoo! UK example query][25] to see it in action.\n\nWell, that’s it. Maybe you like those, maybe not. :) If you’re interested in writing your own apps for [Yahoo! SearchMonkey][2] now, take a look at the official [Manual for SearchMonkey Developers and Publishers][26]! And if you’re now wondering what other applications might be out there, the [Gallery is a good place to start][5].\n\n**UPDATE/DISCLAIMER:** Even though I work for Yahoo! during the day, these are NOT official SearchMonkey apps by Yahoo!. You’re looking at personal stuff. Again, this post, as everything on this site and under this domain, is NOT YAHOO! BUSINESS.

Großer Teller, große Wurst, große Portion Sauerkraut. Lecker! Fix bezahlt und einen Tisch gesucht. Ein paar Meter weiter sitzt ein älterer Herr über einen Masskrug gebeugt; mit einem kurzen Nicken bestätigen wir uns gegenseitig unsere Existenz zu dieser Stunde, an diesem Ort.\n\nIch setze mich, reisse mein Senftütchen auf—und muss feststellen, dass ich versehentlich Mayonnaise[^one] gegriffen habe. Mon dieu! Entschlossen stehe ich auf, gehe zur Ausgabe, nehme mir ein Senftütchen, drehe mich um…\n\n…und sehe einen Raben auf meinem Teller sitzen.\n\nKurz nachgedacht: Nein, ich kann mich nicht entsinnen, den gekauft zu haben. Was geht da vor?!\n\nIch mache einen Schritt auf meinen Tisch zu. Zehn Meter trennen mich von meinem Ziel.\n\nDer Rabe schaut mich an. Ich schaue den Raben an.\n\n_[Tumbleweed fliegt durchs Bild.]_\n\nSeine kleinen schwarzen Knopfaugen mustern mich.\n\nIch mache noch einen Schritt.\n\nDer Rabe greift meine Wurst mit dem Schnabel und fliegt davon.\n\n…\n\nWAS. ZUM. TEUFEL.\n\nIch bin dann zu meinem Tisch gegangen, hab die Fußspuren in meinem Sauerkraut begutachtet, mich auf- und danach wieder abgeregt, hab die Dame an der Kasse danach gefragt, wo ich den Rest meines Essens entsorgen kann, und ihr auf Nachfrage die letzten vier Minuten meines Lebens kurz zusammengefasst. Als ich auf ihr \"Ja, wollen's a naie Portion?\" hin antwortete, dass mein Budget für die Pause aufgebraucht sei, überlegte sie kurz, und gab mir trotzdem einen neuen Teller, aufs Haus. Das nenn ich mal Dienst am Kunden! Dafür gibts zwei Pluspunkte.\n\nIch denke, dies war meine bizarrste Mittagsgeschichte bisher. Verdammtes Rabenviech.\n\n[^one]: Es wird immer \"Mayonnaise\" heissen. Der Tag, an dem ich die sog. \"neue Schreibweise\" benutze, wird der Tag sein, an dem das Abendland untergeht.\n",

There’s a handy little dropdown where you can change this setting.\n* Bugfix: Not broken in Flock anymore.\n* Bugfix: countdown accuracy.\n* Again, there’s a Twitter account for the _highly exciting_ TS minutiae now, [@twerpscan][2]. You might want to keep an eye on that one if you’re interested in the service.\n\n[Twerp Scan][1] received a good amount of hits over the last few days, mainly due to [a post on Download Squad][3]. Honestly, I am a bit surprised about this, but I won’t complain. Nice to see my little experiment is filling a niché for some people. :)\n\nLet me know what you think of the new features. I have more things on my todo list, but my day only has so many hours (and I have a day job).\n\nGood night!\n\n[1]: http://twerpscan.com/\n[2]: http://twitter.com/twerpscan\n[3]: http://www.downloadsquad.com/2008/04/27/twitter-twerp-scan-block-twitter-spammers/\n",

It adds a new mission to the game which promises\n~90 minutes of gameplay, a new location, a new race and a new XBL achievement\n(worth 50 gamerpoints). It costs 400 MS Points (€4.80).</p>\n<p>The mission was nice, nothing out of the ordinary, tho. Drive around in your Mako, clean out some places, gather “leads” (if you want to call them that)\nand then face a boss guy. Make some Paragon/Renegade decisions, get a glimpse at a possible new story line to come and be done with it.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned new location is an asteroid on a collision course with a colonised planet. The rock itself looks like pretty much like any of the old\n“lesser” planets from the main game. It’s okay, not more, not less. What makes it special (to me) is the beautiful planet looming overhead — X57, the asteroid, is heading towards Terra Nova, destined to bring doom and destruction. A grim outlook! Still pretty, tho. Seriously, it’s really shiny,\nbut I’m a sucker for stars and planet imagery, so I might take more joy from something like this than other people.</p>\n<p>Anyways, why is it heading there? Because of the Batarians, a race of 4-eyed humanoids. Apparently they don’t like the Humans for various historical reasons, and thus use their first on-screen appearance ever for speaking with the protagonists in a resentful manner. And for shooting at them. The audacity!</p>\n<p>So, is “Bring Down the Sky” a perfect DLC/addon? No. Bioware’s decision to make this an “in-between mission” is questionable. I can understand it from a storyline point of view &ndash; too much is in flux after finishing the main game,\nwhat with the Council and all. But unfortunately it means I have to go back to a savegame where I could freely roam the galaxy &ndash; i.e. a save that was made prior to visiting Ilos etc. —, and for some people that might be a drawback. A co-worker of mine has no save like that left, and that means he’d have to start over, and therefore he won’t pick up the DLC. So… srsly, not a good decision. (Personally, I was lucky to still have a “good” save, tho.) But the implementation could’ve been smoother. Well, I actually <em>expected</em> it to be smoother.</p>\n<p>And what’s with the silent team members? I though Garrus and Kaiden were pissed since they wouldn’t talk to me during the mission. Not even random chatter. Meh. It’s a small issue, tho. Just something I found a bit strange.</p>\n<p>All in all, tho, it’s been a nice ride. For the average price of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doener\">Döner</a>\nyou get ~90 minutes of additional <a href=\"http://carlo.zottmann.org/2008/01/16/mini-review-mass-effect-xbox-360/\">Mass Effect goodness</a>.

It adds a new mission to the game which promises\n~90 minutes of gameplay, a new location, a new race and a new XBL achievement\n(worth 50 gamerpoints). It costs 400 MS Points (€4.80).\n\nThe mission was nice, nothing out of the ordinary, tho. Drive around in your Mako, clean out some places, gather “leads” (if you want to call them that)\nand then face a boss guy. Make some Paragon/Renegade decisions, get a glimpse at a possible new story line to come and be done with it.\n\nThe aforementioned new location is an asteroid on a collision course with a colonised planet. The rock itself looks like pretty much like any of the old\n“lesser” planets from the main game. It’s okay, not more, not less. What makes it special (to me) is the beautiful planet looming overhead — X57, the asteroid, is heading towards Terra Nova, destined to bring doom and destruction. A grim outlook! Still pretty, tho. Seriously, it’s really shiny,\nbut I’m a sucker for stars and planet imagery, so I might take more joy from something like this than other people.\n\nAnyways, why is it heading there? Because of the Batarians, a race of 4-eyed humanoids. Apparently they don’t like the Humans for various historical reasons, and thus use their first on-screen appearance ever for speaking with the protagonists in a resentful manner. And for shooting at them. The audacity!\n\nSo, is “Bring Down the Sky” a perfect DLC/addon? No. Bioware’s decision to make this an “in-between mission” is questionable. I can understand it from a storyline point of view -- too much is in flux after finishing the main game,\nwhat with the Council and all. But unfortunately it means I have to go back to a savegame where I could freely roam the galaxy -- i.e. a save that was made prior to visiting Ilos etc. —, and for some people that might be a drawback. A co-worker of mine has no save like that left, and that means he’d have to start over, and therefore he won’t pick up the DLC. So… srsly, not a good decision. (Personally, I was lucky to still have a “good” save, tho.) But the implementation could’ve been smoother. Well, I actually _expected_ it to be smoother.\n\nAnd what’s with the silent team members? I though Garrus and Kaiden were pissed since they wouldn’t talk to me during the mission. Not even random chatter. Meh. It’s a small issue, tho. Just something I found a bit strange.\n\nAll in all, tho, it’s been a nice ride. For the average price of a [Döner][4]\nyou get ~90 minutes of additional [Mass Effect goodness][2]. A good bargain in my book.\n\n[1]: //attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/03/masseffect_02_745x440-2.jpg\n[2]: http://carlo.zottmann.org/2008/01/16/mini-review-mass-effect-xbox-360/\n[3]: http://masseffect.bioware.com/galacticcodex/bringdownthesky.html\n[4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doener\n",

It’s a little application that you run everytime you want to log some off-screen time. Basically, it’s just a dialog that allows you to enter a number (i.e. minutes spent), and has some buttons to either log these minutes as “was on the phone” or “was in a meeting”. If you hit “Cancel”, it won’t do anything. (Surprise.)</p>\n<p>Let’s say I’ve just spent 15 minutes on the phone, I’ll run the application,\nenter “15” and hit the Return key—and the last 15 minutes will be logged as phone call in RT. The app will quit once that’s done. Another meeting, another phone call? Rinse, repeat.</p>\n<p>Data-wise, it’ll then create a new file in the right format in RescueTime’s log directory (<code>~/Library/RescueTime/Logs/Pending/</code>). On the next data upload RT will pick up the new file, and it’ll appear in your stats as <em>“manual_phonecall”</em>. Your meetings will appear as <em>“manual_meeting”</em>.</p>\n<p>Please note: <strong>Neither existing RescueTime files nor the RescueTime application will be touched or tinkered with.</strong></p>\n<p>Below you’ll find two downloads.

Basically, it’s just a dialog that allows you to enter a number (i.e. minutes spent), and has some buttons to either log these minutes as “was on the phone” or “was in a meeting”. If you hit “Cancel”, it won’t do anything. (Surprise.)\n\nLet’s say I’ve just spent 15 minutes on the phone, I’ll run the application,\nenter “15” and hit the Return key—and the last 15 minutes will be logged as phone call in RT. The app will quit once that’s done. Another meeting, another phone call? Rinse, repeat.\n\nData-wise, it’ll then create a new file in the right format in RescueTime’s log directory (`~/Library/RescueTime/Logs/Pending/`). On the next data upload RT will pick up the new file, and it’ll appear in your stats as _“manual_phonecall”_. Your meetings will appear as _“manual_meeting”_.\n\nPlease note: **Neither existing RescueTime files nor the RescueTime application will be touched or tinkered with.**\n\nBelow you’ll find two downloads. The first one is the actual script in plain text. The second is the script compiled as application bundle. If you’re unsure which to pick, you’ll most likely want the latter. ;)\n\n* [RescueTime Log Time.applescript][5]\n* [RescueTime Log Time application (ZIP file)][6]\n\nHave fun.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I’ll take no responsibility for loss of data, hair or life. I am very, very sure there won’t be any losses, but still. It works for me, and I’m sharing. Use at your own risk.\n\n[1]: http://rescuetime.com/\n[2]: http://www.rescuetime.com/product_tour\n[3]: http://yaml.org/\n[4]: //attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/02/picture-1.png\n[5]: //attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/02/rescuetime-log-time.applescript (RescueTime Log Time.applescript)\n[6]: //attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2008/02/rescuetime-log-time.zip (RescueTime Log Time.app)\n",

				"content_text": "\nSo, (almost) everyone is totally crazy for lifestreams these days. In case you managed to get around the whole issue so far: a lifestream is basically a big bucket (i.e. web page) where all the updates and update notifications from your blog, your [ADD-induced][1] Twitter posts, your Flickr uploads etc come together in one concise way so it’s easier for others to ignore them. Also,\nyou only have one URL to hand out to hot women in pubs because the stream inadvertedly works as a hub page, too!\n\nJoy.\n\nAnyways, I was talking with [Hendrik][2] about the various stream services out there, and I figured it’d be fairly easy to build something server-less using a wee bit of Javascript and [Yahoo! Pipes][3]. So I’ve spent around an hour to do just that.\n\nThe basic idea is that you make [a pipe containing all your feeds][4], and then access the output using Javascript from your page. Add some styling, [and voilá][5].\n\nIt’s a bit rough around the edges, but hey, it’s just a prototype. It’s not life- or game-changing in any way, but I’d like to share anyways.\n\n**Update 2007-11-21:** It’s mostly broken right now since I am playing around with something.

It&rsquo;s just that it will outright reject anything else. And most HTML pages fall in this category.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s my story on how I managed to make Pipes process run-of-the-mill HTML pages. I couldn&rsquo;t find anything on this topic on the net, so even though I don&rsquo;t think I am the first guy to tackle this problem, I want to share what I found out.</p>\n<p>A little background. I wanted to build a comic feed for <a href=\"http://explosm.net/\">Explosm.net&rsquo;s Cyanide &amp; Happiness</a>, a comic strip for the …wicked. C&amp;H has an official RSS feed, but it only carries links to the new comic pages. Which is fine and dandy for most people, but <em>I am a busy guy</em>, you know, what with my hectic web-3.1 lifestyle and all, and I really can&rsquo;t afford to even lose 20 seconds by clicking through <em>to anywhere</em>. (Read: I&rsquo;m really lazy.)</p>\n<p>So I tried to make Pipes to parse the Explosm.net comic pages and produce a Pipes-powered feed that not only had the link, but also the particular comic image for that day.</p>\n<p>I started out with the <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/docs?doc=sources#FetchFeed\">Fetch Feed module</a> reading the <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/Explosm\">Explosm.net RSS feed</a>. I am usually not interested in anything but the comics, so in a second step, I made use of the <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/docs?doc=operators#Filter\">Filter module</a> to ditch feed items that doesn&rsquo;t contain the word &ldquo;comic&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>So that left me with a list of feed items, each with a link, a description, a title and some other metadata.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s where the trouble started. Boy, what was I thinking?! The HTML pages are far from perfect, they sure as hell doesn&rsquo;t validate as XML. Then again — that&rsquo;s alright! The site wasn&rsquo;t made for scraping or parsing, it was made to display -tasteful- weird comic strips, and that&rsquo;s enough. I like it for that.  It&rsquo;s just that there is no Pipes module to grab a glob of textual data and work with it. (Yet? Please, someone say &ldquo;Yet&rdquo;, employing a knowing undertone.)</p>\n<p>After a while of trying to beat any of the available <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/docs?doc=sources\">&lsquo;Fetch *&rsquo; modules</a> into submission, I was close to giving up. But then I remember I had come across a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Tidy\">HTML Tidy</a> service a few months or years ago. After a few minutes, I had rediscovered it: <a href=\"http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/tidy\">W3C&rsquo;s own Tidy service</a>.

It took me a few minutes to find the exact location of the image element (<code>body.div.table.tr.td.div.0.div.1.table.tr.td.1.div.font.0.content</code>), which I then stored in a new attribute named <code>item.content</code>.</p>\n<p><em>(While we&rsquo;re at it, in the future I would very much like to have the option to use XPath addressing in &lsquo;Fetch Data&rsquo;… or any related module, for that matter.

And also have horrible search facilities. Plus the links don’t work, or even worse, <em>there are none</em>.</p>\n<p>Still, I read some magazines. Not many, just a very few.

				"content_text": "\nHuh, so [I’ve been tagged by Frank][1]. Splendid. :P\n\nI’ve used to read quite a few magazines in the day, mostly to feed my habit (PC gaming, back then); a remnant of happy times past, when I was a kid. You see, I grew up in Eastern Germany, and while I had no problems or real shortcomings there, I never really had the chance to buy computer magazines of any sort (programming, gaming etc.)—simply because _there were none_.\n\nWell, then one happy day, friends of my parents from Western Germany visited us, and lo and behold, they brought a few dozen (slightly outdated) computing magazines, just for me.\n\nNeedless to say, a great day in my life.\n\nBut with the advent of the Intertron I retreated more and more from reading paper magazine, mostly because they’re too slow. And also have horrible search facilities. Plus the links don’t work, or even worse, _there are none_.\n\nStill, I read some magazines. Not many, just a very few. Mostly on the weekends, because it’s so much cooler to read while lying in a hammock, and let’s face it, a laptop in a hammock just doesn’t cut it.\n\nSo, what do I read these days?\n\n* [Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin][2]—great little publication, comes with the SZ Friday issue. It may sound silly, but I really fell for that one. I consider it one of my weekly weekend highlights, because I thorougly enjoy it.\n* [The Escapist][3]—a weekly _free_ magazine about gaming culture. Not about reviews and previews and what’s hot etc, mind you. The magazine approaches gaming on a more psychological, human, laid-back level.

Somehow it doesn’t click with me anymore. Someone once described it to me as _“Bunte für Intellektuelle”_, which I found funny, while at the same time think it’s slightly incorrect.\n\nWell, that’s it.

Approximately one every 15 seconds. <em>&ldquo;That guy came online&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;The other guy went offline&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;OMG the third guy is out for lunch now&rdquo;</em>. It was hard to follow the presentation, to be honest. The funny thing was that the presenter didn&rsquo;t really seem to notice them anymore. Or didn&rsquo;t care, hard to say. In that case: why did he even turn them on in the first place? Oh, wait, he didn&rsquo;t, the messaging client has them activated by default. <strong>My advice: turn them off NOW.</strong> Usually these things do nothing else than stealing your attention from your actual work, either your conscious or unconscious attention. Seriously, you probably don&rsquo;t need them anyways. If you want to know whether someone is on, just take a peek at the damn contact list, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s there for.</p>\n<h3 id=\"im-new-message-notifications-are-evil\">IM new message notifications are EVIL.</h3>\n<p>Most IM clients have an in-your-face attitude. When there is a new message coming in, it&rsquo;s slapped across the screen, on top of everything else, stealing the focus. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re typing a mail, looking on your keyboard, as most people do, and a new IM is coming in &ndash; the message window pops up, the cursor is put in the reply box, and you&rsquo;re writing the rest of the sentence (that was supposed to be part of the email) into the messenger window. <strong>My advice:\nchange that NOW.</strong> My client is configured to get out of my face. When a new message is received, the window is either popping up in the very background of the desktop, not stealing focus, or it is opened minimized in the taskbar.\nThat&rsquo;s enough. I&rsquo;ll see it soon enough, and it doesn&rsquo;t keep me from working.</p>\n<h3 id=\"im-client-sounds-are-evil\">IM client sounds are EVIL.</h3>\n<p>Seriously, they might be hilarious at first, but the constant chirping and barking and clingclanging and dingdinging is unnerving. <strong>My advice:\ndeactivate sounds NOW.</strong> Mostly because you don&rsquo;t want your IM client to steal your attention or your focus, and sounds are the very best way to achieve that. Nice side-effect: your co-workers will start to like you again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"new-mail-notifications-are-evil\">New mail notifications are EVIL.</h3>\n<p>Many IM or email clients allow you to watch your mailbox, telling you when new mail is coming in. Constantly. That&rsquo;s almost as bad as IM contact status notifications. How the hell are you supposed to follow a train of thought if shit is popping up <em>all the time</em>? Exactly. <strong>My advice: turn them off NOW.</strong>\nYou have a mail client, you check it every one or two hours anyways, that&rsquo;s enough.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reduce-email-polling-interval\">Reduce email polling interval.</h3>\n<p>Three words: Information inflow paralysis. I get a few hundred mails per day,\nsomething like 1 mails per minute. Mostly mailing list mails and bug tracker mails. <strong>My advice: Polling for new mails once per hour is enough.</strong> YMMV, of course. You have to answer them at some point, or even read them. At least in my profession (engineering, read: coding and fixing things) I have to do real work somehow, and I won&rsquo;t get anything done if I stare at my inbox all day long.</p>\n<p>Now suggesting this I often hear the argument <em>&ldquo;But I am supposed to answer mails right away!&quot;</em>. Really? I mean, <em>really REALLY</em>? I would be surprised. If I had to venture a guess I&rsquo;d say that isn&rsquo;t true for most people. Unless you&rsquo;re working at NORAD and waiting for clearance to bomb Utah or Thuringia from space, it&rsquo;s probably okay to take an hour or two to reply to a new mail.\nSo what I do is keeping my mail client minimized, and taking a peek every hour.</p>\n<h3 id=\"email-client-use-filters-for-the-love-of-god-use-filters\">Email client: Use filters, for the love of God, USE FILTERS.</h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, I get hundreds of emails. I&rsquo;d be pulling my hair out if I had to sift through them manually. Therefore, I set up filtering rules in my email client (I use Thunderbird 3alpha, by the way). When new mails are coming in, they are checked against ~3 dozen filters. They are tagged with the name of the mailing list, they are checked for particular keywords and filtered by senders &ndash; and tagged accordingly, too. Once that is done, everything that is tagged is moved <em>out of the inbox</em> into a huge archive. In addition, I have a number of saved searches; one for every mailing list, one for every keyword or topic. I can see on a glimpse how many new mails came in via any given mailing list. I can see on a glimpse whether there are new mails dealing with that particular project XYZ I am working on. <em>But first and foremost, the only stuff left in my inbox is everything that has not been processed, and that&rsquo;s usually the new mail for <strong>me</strong></em>. No bug reports, no mailing list mails, just stuff I should probably read right away. Also, the other mails are sorted into neat piles for easy consumption whenever I have the time.

So, a polling mechanism would be needed.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you have a cronjob gizmo that polls your peers’ whitelists once a day. I think in order to end up with a working implementation that doesn’t require much work or time once built, we’d need to come up with a standardized URL scheme. This would allow for simple inclusion of new trusted sources. For example, my whitelist would be accessible under\n<code>[http://carlo.zottmann.org/trust/whitelist/][2]</code> (example, my OpenID is\n<code>carlo.zottmann.org</code>, but the URL is not working right now). Yours would be stored at <code>http://[OpenID]/trust/whitelist/</code>.</p>\n<p>Now if I decide to trust another netizen’s judgement when it comes to other people, I’d simply add her/his OpenID (for example,\n<code>[http://my.open.id.omg/][3]</code>) to my imaginary polling mechanism, which would know where to look for the whitelist—at <code>http://[OpenID]/trust/whitelist/</code>, in our case that’d mean <code>[http://my.open.id.omg/trust/whitelist/][4]</code>.</p>\n<p>Of course this implies that you have added <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/01/03/OpenID-for-non-SuperUsers\">OpenID delegation</a> to your blog/site. Now if you move to another ID provider, you’d simply adjust the delegation, your ID would stay the same. As would the whitelist URL. You could even place on another machine, as long as the URL remains the same—<code>http://[OpenID]/trust/whitelist/</code>.</p>\n<p>Now, when you decide I’m totally out of my mind after making a few bad choices about who to include in my whitelist, you’d simply “unsubscribe” from my whitelist, and that’d be it. On the next caching run our imaginary mechanism would weed out my list of trusted OpenIDs.</p>\n<p>Another idea would be something like feed autodiscovery, but for whitelists,\nalthough I’m not so sure about that.

				"content_html": "<p>A few weeks ago I was minding my own business at <a href=\"http://de.yahoo.com\">work</a>, writing a\n<a href=\"http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org\">Greasemonkey</a> script to solve a problem I had, when I noticed that apparently I had found the solution for a GM problem that not only I had but a number of other people as well. So, I tinkered and tinkered and tinkered some more and discovered that I had managed to write something fairly wicked that I had never seen before.</p>\n<p>Now, when it comes to my own code, I always tend to be somewhat cautious about getting too excited about it. I myself might find it pretty cool and elegant,\nbut I always have the nagging feeling that I might have overlooked some glaring problem or messed up otherwise. (Interestingly enough this behaviour surfaced around the time I started working at Yahoo!. Heh. That’s what happens when you know there <a href=\"http://www.crockford.com/\">are</a> <a href=\"http://simonwillison.net/\">real</a> <a href=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/\">top</a> <a href=\"http://lerdorf.com/bio.php\">dogs</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Schachter\">around</a>.\nHonestly, we pack some serious talent around the world, which can feel a bit frightening at times.)</p>\n<p>Anyways, I finished it up and posted it on one of our internal mailing lists,\nand after getting back some very encouraging comments I decided to show it to\n<a href=\"http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-JG9noGk0aa9kLMDBru_y9a2uxmo-\">Eric</a>, one of our major Javascript famosos.</p>\n<p>Turns out he found it interesting enough to ask me whether I want to write an article for one of our public dev blogs. Holy crap.</p>\n<p>So yesterday I finished a working example, and today I’ve submitted my article.

				"content_text": "\nA few weeks ago I was minding my own business at [work][1], writing a\n[Greasemonkey][2] script to solve a problem I had, when I noticed that apparently I had found the solution for a GM problem that not only I had but a number of other people as well. So, I tinkered and tinkered and tinkered some more and discovered that I had managed to write something fairly wicked that I had never seen before.\n\nNow, when it comes to my own code, I always tend to be somewhat cautious about getting too excited about it. I myself might find it pretty cool and elegant,\nbut I always have the nagging feeling that I might have overlooked some glaring problem or messed up otherwise. (Interestingly enough this behaviour surfaced around the time I started working at Yahoo!. Heh. That’s what happens when you know there [are][3] [real][4] [top][5] [dogs][6] [around][7].\nHonestly, we pack some serious talent around the world, which can feel a bit frightening at times.)\n\nAnyways, I finished it up and posted it on one of our internal mailing lists,\nand after getting back some very encouraging comments I decided to show it to\n[Eric][8], one of our major Javascript famosos.\n\nTurns out he found it interesting enough to ask me whether I want to write an article for one of our public dev blogs. Holy crap.\n\nSo yesterday I finished a working example, and today I’ve submitted my article. When all goes well, and after some (hopefully) serious proof-reading\n(to make sure I don’t make a fool out of myself after all), it will be presented to the interwebs.\n\nNow, I don’t want to tell you where or what, mostly because I am getting increasingly paranoid about bragging. But quite frankly, I am amazed I made it this far, and even if it isn’t published after all, at least it was considered interesting enough to let me take a shot there.\n\nAnd for me, that is quite something.\n\n[1]: http://de.yahoo.com\n[2]: http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org\n[3]: http://www.crockford.com/\n[4]: http://simonwillison.net/\n[5]: http://jeremy.zawodny.com/\n[6]: http://lerdorf.com/bio.php\n[7]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Schachter\n[8]: http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-JG9noGk0aa9kLMDBru_y9a2uxmo-\n",

On the one hand, I love playing with him. (Yes, I know how this sounds.) Plus, EVE consumed quite a bit of my time in the past; actually I dropped out and in a few times by now right from the beginning.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//attic.czm.io/blog-assets/2006/11/160x600_01.jpg\" alt=\"EVE Online\">On the other hand, my relationship with EVE was always somewhat …abusive; I wanted to like EVE, I actually still do, but she kept hitting me over and over again. Mostly with boredom, while at the same time flashing off some nasty (the good kind).</p>\n<p>I always <em>felt</em> like there was much love just around the corner, but in the end it boiled down to doing endless cargo runs, spending mindnumbing hours mining asteroids or quickly dying at the hands of some over-equipped,\nmerciless (and most likely also bored) ass enemy player.</p>\n<p>(Let me tell you: after doing endless cargo runs or spending mindnumbing hours mining asteroids, dying quickly at the hands of some over-equipped, merciless\n(and most likely also bored) ass enemy player is to fun what a McNugget is to a real chicken.)</p>\n<p>Nonetheless—I loved how EVE doesn’t put silly limitations on you. It just doesn’t. There this huge, vast playing field, waiting for players to fill it,\nand I always just loved the <em>feeling</em> of having no limits. Trading? There.\nFighting? There (alright, point’n’click). Playing the stock market? There.\nAuction house? There. Shiny things? You bet. Skill trees, warfare, money making, team play? They got you covered.</p>\n<p>In the end, tho, it always ended with me looking for a good corporation to join. I was looking for a casual outfit. The problem with that? A casual outfit/corporation probably won’t cut it. If you want to play with the big boys, you have to put in some real effort. But sorry, I already do have a job,\nI am looking for a <em>game</em>. I doubt you can make a difference (or play a nice,\nfun game) when you’re on your own. So I couldn’t find a good corp, got bored or frustrated, and left. Then wait a few months, see something shiny, let the\n“wounds” heal, forget, rinse and repeat.</p>\n<p>And now they dangle <a href=\"http://www.eve-online.com/features/Revelations/\">Revelations</a> before my watering eyes, and the more I read about it, the more I feel my weakness grow.

				"content_text": "\nWhen [Hendrik][1] dropped [a few][2] [bomb shells][3] about the upcoming [EVE expansion][4], I was feeling a bit unsure at first. On the one hand, I love playing with him. (Yes, I know how this sounds.) Plus, EVE consumed quite a bit of my time in the past; actually I dropped out and in a few times by now right from the beginning.\n\n![EVE Online][5]On the other hand, my relationship with EVE was always somewhat …abusive; I wanted to like EVE, I actually still do, but she kept hitting me over and over again. Mostly with boredom, while at the same time flashing off some nasty (the good kind).\n\nI always _felt_ like there was much love just around the corner, but in the end it boiled down to doing endless cargo runs, spending mindnumbing hours mining asteroids or quickly dying at the hands of some over-equipped,\nmerciless (and most likely also bored) ass enemy player.\n\n(Let me tell you: after doing endless cargo runs or spending mindnumbing hours mining asteroids, dying quickly at the hands of some over-equipped, merciless\n(and most likely also bored) ass enemy player is to fun what a McNugget is to a real chicken.)\n\nNonetheless—I loved how EVE doesn’t put silly limitations on you. It just doesn’t. There this huge, vast playing field, waiting for players to fill it,\nand I always just loved the _feeling_ of having no limits. Trading? There.\nFighting? There (alright, point’n’click). Playing the stock market? There.\nAuction house? There. Shiny things? You bet. Skill trees, warfare, money making, team play? They got you covered.\n\nIn the end, tho, it always ended with me looking for a good corporation to join. I was looking for a casual outfit. The problem with that? A casual outfit/corporation probably won’t cut it. If you want to play with the big boys, you have to put in some real effort. But sorry, I already do have a job,\nI am looking for a _game_. I doubt you can make a difference (or play a nice,\nfun game) when you’re on your own. So I couldn’t find a good corp, got bored or frustrated, and left. Then wait a few months, see something shiny, let the\n“wounds” heal, forget, rinse and repeat.\n\nAnd now they dangle [Revelations][6] before my watering eyes, and the more I read about it, the more I feel my weakness grow. Damn you, [Mans][1]! God, I hate you. :P\n\nAnyways, the expansion is supposed to be out tomorrow. And the [feature list][6] and what the [devs are blogging][7] is mouth-watering. Oh my.\n\nAre some of you playing EVE? I told you what I was looking for. Are there any companies willing to show two, somewhat capable pilots (who actually still have some funds left from the past) what EVE feels like if you have a bigger crew to roll with? Hypothetically speaking, of course. I still don’t know whether I will reactivate my account.\n\nEVE, baby, I might be coming back.

If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you.\n>\n> Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your partner out to dinner. Play another 18. There will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal later.\n>\n> Take care of the golf balls first -- the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.\"\n>\n> One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee represented. The professor smiled.\n>\n> \"I'm glad you asked.

What did you do in 2004 that you&rsquo;d never done before?</em> Driving on the left side of the road for four days straight. Yes, I&rsquo;m talking about our trip to Ireland.</p>\n<p><em>2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</em> I didn&rsquo;t have any resolutions. I don&rsquo;t think you need the &ldquo;magic of the new year&rdquo; if you want to accomplish something. Do it or do it not, heck, you might even just try, but you don&rsquo;t need the new year to do it. :)</p>\n<p><em>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</em> No. But a number of people are hard at work to make me answer this question with a clear &ldquo;yes&rdquo; next year.</p>\n<p><em>4. Did anyone close to you die?</em> No.</p>\n<p><em>5. What countries did you visit?</em> Ireland (lovely!). Austria (very briefly).</p>\n<p><em>6. What would you like to have in 2005 that you lacked in 2004?</em> Emotional equilibrium. (Yes, I stole that answer from <a href=\"#\">Beryl</a>. So sue me &ndash; she is right and I couldn&rsquo;t have put it any better.)</p>\n<p><em>7. What day from 2004 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</em> Oiy. I clearly remember the wedding days of my little sister Claudia and my big semi-\nsister Susi. :) And I recall a number of days because I was kicked in the nuts at work, so to speak. Can&rsquo;t remember the dates, tho.</p>\n<p><em>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</em> Not quitting my job. Took an aweful lot of self-constraint, but I have to earn money to keep us afloat.</p>\n<p><em>9. What was your biggest failure?</em> Not getting an Oscar. Really, no idea. I don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t fail anywhere, but there&rsquo;s nothing standing out.</p>\n<p><em>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</em> Not really, apart from the occasional cold.</p>\n<p><em>11. What was the best thing you bought?</em> Tough call… Our new leather couch comes to mind.

What song will always remind you of 2004?</em> Probably &ldquo;Vertigo&rdquo; by U2.</p>\n<p><em>17. Compared to this time last year, are you:</em> i. happier or sadder? Personal life: happier. Work life: much sadder. ii. thinner or fatter? No change. iii.\nricher or poorer? A bit richer both in experience and financially, I think. ;)</p>\n<p><em>18. What do you wish you&rsquo;d done more of?</em> Quitting my job, telling them to shove it. I wish I could do this once a week… the fun would never stop. Of course this&rsquo;d mean we&rsquo;d be broke in no time, so that makes it a no-go. (Short explanation: Dana needs to get a new job before I&rsquo;ll be willing to even consider any next steps.)</p>\n<p><em>19. What do you wish you&rsquo;d done less of?</em> Getting that much agitated in the office. It&rsquo;s just not healty.</p>\n<p><em>20. How did you spend Christmas?</em> With my wife.

				"title": "Of weddings, cake and tribes",
				"content_html": "<p>My baby sister Claudia married her longtime friend Tino this weekend. Yes, we were invited. :)</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll skip the part where we fought against the Gods of the Autobahn on Friday (car crashes, construction sites and car crashes within construction sites along the road, took us ten hours to drive there) and how we got almost no sleep the night before and get right to the wedding day.</p>\n<p>We drove to the town where the church is, Rossla. First, there was the appointment at the register office (that&rsquo;s the term?) where they were legally married. Afterwards we went over to the church where there was a nice ceremony (Tino&rsquo;s is of Christian faith). I was amazed to see they had hired a singer who was standing on the second floor, singing two songs (<em>My heart will go on</em> and <em>Goodbye, english rose</em>). Nice songs, she had a great, powerful voice, but I was slightly irrated by the fact that both songs are actually songs of farewell… nevermind. The priest was doing a great job talking about marriage and the life afterwards, and it was very cool and amusing, mostly because he wasn&rsquo;t preachy or anything, it was very down-to-earth and sometimes downright funny. (I thanked him afterwards… I was expecting some Father-Lovejoy&rsquo;ish speech, but I&rsquo;m glad he did it the way he did.)</p>\n<p>Then we went for the traditional wedding day lunch (I really don&rsquo;t know what the english term is). The location was …interesting, to say the least. Apparently the owners were friends of Tino and Claudia. It was more a pub than a restaurant, and they clearly weren&rsquo;t outfitted to deal with 50 people. I mean, damn, they had four different types of spoons, knives and forks, and they had them <em>mixed</em>. That left me somewhat puzzled. The food was okay&rsquo;ish, but I was expecting something better on my sister&rsquo;s wedding day. Still, the newlyweds were enjoying it, so it was okay with me as well. (More on this notion later on.)</p>\n<p>Afterwards, we drove to the final location, which was a restaurant slash rural party location, where they served coffee and cake and everything. That was nice. <strong>Great</strong> cake. A couple of hours later the catering service blessed us with good food again. :)</p>\n<p>Finally the guy with the music arrived. He was some sort of village DJ, and I honestly have to say I loathed his mixture of music. I really did, it was tragically bad. In my personal opinion it was the musical version of a horrible and messy train crash. It was a mix of what Japanese and American tourist expect a typical German to listen to all day plus some eurodiscotrash from the slopes of the Alps (drunk skiing, yeah) plus the worst from the coasts of Mallorca. Interestingly, most people seemed to enjoy it. ;)</p>\n<p>Then there was dancing, drinking, games for the newlyweds, drinking, yelling to the music, drinking, drinking, smoking, drinking and dancing.</p>\n<p>All in all the night was rather strange to my eyes and ears. Yet, it seemed to thoroughly please both my sis and her husband, so it was okay with me as well. :)</p>\n<p>At three in the morning, the party was over since everyone was either asleep, almost asleep, gone or hardly able to defy gravity due to excessive amounts of alcohol flooding their bloodstreams. (Man, these people can drink. I bet if more people would be like this, drinking was olympic already.)</p>\n<p>A few thoughts about this very day and what I heard, saw and sensed. My sister is deeply in love with Tino, even after spending six years with him already, and this very day she was the happiest person in the world. I kinda know what it&rsquo;s like, and I&rsquo;m so glad she found a person to share her live with, not just some guy, but the very person who was clearly the missing piece in her life. I&rsquo;m thankful that I was able to catch a few glimpses of that love when they smiled at or danced with eachother.</p>\n<p>But I think she hasn&rsquo;t married a single man, she&rsquo;s married a tribe, and I&rsquo;m <strong>not</strong> saying that in degrading manner. It&rsquo;s a small village, and apparently these few dozens of people all went through a couple of things over the last few decades, they know eachother and their lifes. It has brought them together in a family kind of sense. Many of them are related, closely or loosely, and those who are not are real friends.

				"content_text": "\nMy baby sister Claudia married her longtime friend Tino this weekend. Yes, we were invited. :)\n\nI'll skip the part where we fought against the Gods of the Autobahn on Friday (car crashes, construction sites and car crashes within construction sites along the road, took us ten hours to drive there) and how we got almost no sleep the night before and get right to the wedding day.\n\nWe drove to the town where the church is, Rossla. First, there was the appointment at the register office (that's the term?) where they were legally married. Afterwards we went over to the church where there was a nice ceremony (Tino's is of Christian faith). I was amazed to see they had hired a singer who was standing on the second floor, singing two songs (_My heart will go on_ and _Goodbye, english rose_). Nice songs, she had a great, powerful voice, but I was slightly irrated by the fact that both songs are actually songs of farewell… nevermind. The priest was doing a great job talking about marriage and the life afterwards, and it was very cool and amusing, mostly because he wasn't preachy or anything, it was very down-to-earth and sometimes downright funny. (I thanked him afterwards… I was expecting some Father-Lovejoy'ish speech, but I'm glad he did it the way he did.)\n\nThen we went for the traditional wedding day lunch (I really don't know what the english term is). The location was …interesting, to say the least. Apparently the owners were friends of Tino and Claudia. It was more a pub than a restaurant, and they clearly weren't outfitted to deal with 50 people. I mean, damn, they had four different types of spoons, knives and forks, and they had them _mixed_. That left me somewhat puzzled. The food was okay'ish, but I was expecting something better on my sister's wedding day. Still, the newlyweds were enjoying it, so it was okay with me as well. (More on this notion later on.)\n\nAfterwards, we drove to the final location, which was a restaurant slash rural party location, where they served coffee and cake and everything. That was nice. **Great** cake. A couple of hours later the catering service blessed us with good food again. :)\n\nFinally the guy with the music arrived. He was some sort of village DJ, and I honestly have to say I loathed his mixture of music. I really did, it was tragically bad. In my personal opinion it was the musical version of a horrible and messy train crash. It was a mix of what Japanese and American tourist expect a typical German to listen to all day plus some eurodiscotrash from the slopes of the Alps (drunk skiing, yeah) plus the worst from the coasts of Mallorca. Interestingly, most people seemed to enjoy it. ;)\n\nThen there was dancing, drinking, games for the newlyweds, drinking, yelling to the music, drinking, drinking, smoking, drinking and dancing.\n\nAll in all the night was rather strange to my eyes and ears. Yet, it seemed to thoroughly please both my sis and her husband, so it was okay with me as well. :)\n\nAt three in the morning, the party was over since everyone was either asleep, almost asleep, gone or hardly able to defy gravity due to excessive amounts of alcohol flooding their bloodstreams. (Man, these people can drink. I bet if more people would be like this, drinking was olympic already.)\n\nA few thoughts about this very day and what I heard, saw and sensed. My sister is deeply in love with Tino, even after spending six years with him already, and this very day she was the happiest person in the world. I kinda know what it's like, and I'm so glad she found a person to share her live with, not just some guy, but the very person who was clearly the missing piece in her life. I'm thankful that I was able to catch a few glimpses of that love when they smiled at or danced with eachother.\n\nBut I think she hasn't married a single man, she's married a tribe, and I'm **not** saying that in degrading manner. It's a small village, and apparently these few dozens of people all went through a couple of things over the last few decades, they know eachother and their lifes. It has brought them together in a family kind of sense. Many of them are related, closely or loosely, and those who are not are real friends. These people are there for eachother, they share everything, and if one of them ever needs help, the others are there.\n\nMy sister is part of this tribe now, and she's enjoying it. It is not my way of life, and while I don't think I could ever be a part of a community like this, I can clearly see that she can, and she is now. She's happy there, and so is her husband.\n\nOver the last few years we were talking on the phone every now and then, and when she told me about the job insecurity and the fucked up job market I recommended packing the bags and moving away. She always told me that she wouldn't do that because of her friends and everything she had there. I wasn't really sure I understood what she meant, but there always was a certain sense of _\"my place is here\"_. I never really knew what she really wanted to express there, but now I know. And to be honest, I'm glad I do.\n\nSo, all in all, I can say that the wedding day wasn't what I expected. Some parts were just great, other… eeeeh, not so much. But it doesn't matter what I think or what I would've done if I had my say. I told her that (in my/our opinion) wedding days are best planned with the following thought in mind: _\"Screw you, it's OUR day.\"_ Hell, we did the same. I'm convinced half of the people at our wedding thought it was a crappy day, but who gives a damn, because it was our day, and it was good. So who cares whether I liked the lunch or the music -- they seemed to enjoy it, my sister and her husband were happy, and that is _exactly_ what counts for me.

May you have a good life and bright kids. You'll do great, you two. :)\n\nCarlo\n",

Not enough people, not enough time, to many fucking jobs in a day, the usual. Plus, an in-house communication which seems to come straight from the deepest depths in Hell.\nOne of the more capable managers was promoted vice CEO earlier this year, and our CEO tagged him with the honorable job of straightening out the internal processes &ndash; communications, inter-department processes, everything.</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago we had a rather lengthy staff meeting about it where they were presenting the new ideas and everything. The new guy is actually a nice guy,\nworks for our company for a couple of years by now and knows his trades. Good for him. They&rsquo;ve announced that they want to flatten the hierarchies, to strengthen the overall quality of our work etc. etc. No layoffs, tho, in the long run we will probably hire a number of new people. And they want to do it\n<strong>with</strong> us, not against us and not from above. Because they want it to take off, and they can&rsquo;t do that without the staff. So the premise is: whatever we do, we&rsquo;re trying to discuss it with you. And this time,we actually mean it.\n(Actually, the whole quality management idea is one or two years late. People are tired, but hey, it&rsquo;s a just fight anyways.)</p>\n<p>Well, good then. I applauded the overall notion.</p>\n<p>(By now, they even hired an consultant who was interviewing people and assembling his findings in a report for everyone. <em>&ldquo;This is the mood, these are the problems, here are possible solutions, YMMV.&quot;</em> Was a good report, by the way.)</p>\n<p>Pondering about how it can be done, I came to two conclusions. 1 - You can&rsquo;t email everyone everytime you want an opinion. 2 - You can&rsquo;t schedule a meeting everytime you want an opinion. So I went ahead and told them about management blogs. In great detail, actually. &ldquo;See, this is a weblog, this is the idea behind it, you&rsquo;d post and give those who want to discuss it the ability to do it&rdquo;. The vice CEO was amazed and thanked me for the idea, and to be honest, I still think he meant it. He asked me to set up a blog for him and his team\n(the heads of our departments) so they can post whenever they feel like, i.e.\nthey want/need to live that new communication thang. (In the past, decisions were made and noone was informed, which led to confusion, anger and overall pissyness. You know the score, I guess.) He knew that if he wants to break the\n&ldquo;nothing good has ever come from the top&rdquo; mood at the watercooler, he&rsquo;d have to fight for it.</p>\n<p>So I did just that. After I&rsquo;ve explained the interface to them I told them four things.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You have to post <strong>yourselves</strong>. It won&rsquo;t work if you let your secretaries do it. If you want it to work, <strong>you</strong> have to do it. If you don&rsquo;t plan to do that, we can stop right now.</li>\n<li>You have to post regularily. Doesn&rsquo;t have to be long posts, just let them know whenever there is something going on, important or not. If you don&rsquo;t plan to do that, we can stop right now.</li>\n<li>You have to explain people what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish. Only if they understand it, they won&rsquo;t oppose and/or ignore it.</li>\n<li>Try to be clear and to the point.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Number 3 is the hardest thing. We had about a dozen applications that were rolled out in the past, and noone told the staff why. <em>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bugtracking system.&rdquo; - &ldquo;What for? … Hello?&quot;</em> Couple of months later: <em>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a time tracking system.&rdquo; - &ldquo;Why are we doing this? … Hello?&quot;</em> It&rsquo;s pretty bad,\nreally. They count on us to figure it out ourselves. I&rsquo;m really not sure why they won&rsquo;t talk about it, but apparently in their minds the delivery is the goal. <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s delivered? Job&rsquo;s done.&quot;</em> Yeah. Except not. It&rsquo;s really really bad.</p>\n<p>So, the new quality management idea is to communicate to avoid and solve problems. Great idea. The vice decided the new management blog is the way to go, the best tool for the job. Yes! Everything&rsquo;s gonna be peachy now!</p>\n<p>Yeah. Except not.</p>\n<p>Yesterday the vice CEO mailed the consultant&rsquo;s report to everyone. He mentioned the blog and that it&rsquo;ll be rolled out next week. My boys and I talked about it and concluded that spreading the report meant a raised need to discuss things, because that&rsquo;s what they said, the report is topic to discussion. It also meant that this day was the best day to officially start the management blog. You already have your first topic, so roll with it to promote the new tool you have. There&rsquo;d actually be a reason to check the blog\n&ndash; you could discuss the different topics right there. So I&rsquo;ve told the Vice just that, and he agreed. This morning, one of his staff made the first post.\n<em>&ldquo;Hello, this is a discussion board, here&rsquo;s the report, discuss please.&quot;</em> Then he mailed the URL to everyone, and that was it. When he wrote it he came to me asking which categories he should pick for the post. He was frightened and insecure about it. Well, you have to crawl before you learn to walk, right?\nThis was a new shore for him, the whole concept was/is rather alien to him and his pals. I figured they will become more secure as they use it.</p>\n<p>When I talked about it with my co-workers at lunch, I was greeted by shrugs.\n<em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo; - &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand that, what is it, a new tool we&rsquo;re supposed to use?&rdquo; - &ldquo;Do I have to post there now?

Serenity (the codename for G-Blog.net v2) is one big construction site, and even tho everything is progressing rather nicely, I always have the feeling to forget something, a particular thought,\nthat - once I've overlooked it - could bring the whole thing down later on.\n\nIt's probably nonsense, but still, the nagging feeling is there.\n\nOther than that, I'm slowly getting there. Python is a charm to work with, and my tools of the trade are [Komodo][2], [SQLObject][3], [ElementTree][4] and\n[PyTextile][5]. I've written a SettingParser module to not have to write every settings page by hand (does the rendering of the pages, the validation of the single settings and input fields, as well as the user level authentification,\nall controlled by a description XML file), I've tightened security/privacy on an user model level (i.e. there's even less chance anyone but you will see your private entries), you can already make and edit entries, the registration/login etc. are built in, user levels (as in free accounts,\npremium accounts, moderators, admins etc.)… there's a lot of stuff done in its basic form, and I think I got a good foundation to further develop the site.\n\nAs I've said, I'm slowly getting there. (Emphasis on \"slowly\".)\n\nAnyways, I felt like utilizing my screen capture utility today, so here are\n[some early shots of Serenity][6].\n\nBack to work.\n\n[1]: http://allinthehead.com/retro/203/\n[2]: http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/\n[3]: http://www.sqlobject.org/\n[4]: http://www.effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm\n[5]: http://dealmeida.net/projects/textile/\n[6]: http://docs.g-blog.net/bilder_etc/serenity/\n",

A couple of weeks ago I&rsquo;ve discovered <a href=\"http://www.0Spam.com\">0Spam.com</a>, a relatively new kid on the block. 0Spam&rsquo;s concept is a tad bit different from the usual spam filters, since it&rsquo;s making use of whitelists and blacklists. Here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>\n<p>Every ten minutes or so, the 0Spam gizmos check my POP3 account. If they find mails from senders which are not on my whitelist yet, they&rsquo;re are moved to the 0Spam server, and the sender is sent a validation mail. Now the sender\n(assuming it&rsquo;s a real person and not a viagra-powered penis enlargement robot)\nhas a week to visit the link in the mail where s/he is presented with a validation code s/he has to enter manually. Once this is done, the 0Spam gizmos know the original mail came from an actual human, and the particular mail is moved from the 0Spam server back to my POP3 account. The sender is then marked as &ldquo;good&rdquo; for future reference, which means that once you&rsquo;ve visited that validation link after mailing me, you won&rsquo;t have to do it ever again. You&rsquo;re validated once, and that&rsquo;s enough.</p>\n<p>There are a number of settings I can edit in my account. First of all, I can set the time span the sender is given to validation link - options range between 1 to 14 days. If the sender doesn&rsquo;t visit the validation page within that time frame, the mail will be discarded. Second, I can set up more than just one POP3/Hotmail/Yahoo account to be checked periodically by ospam.\nThird, I can influence the auto-whitelisting behaviour (the above mentioned behaviour of automatically marking a validated sender as &ldquo;good&rdquo; for the future).</p>\n<p>Entering whitelists and blacklists.</p>\n<p>A so-called &ldquo;whitelist&rdquo; is a list of good senders, people or domains that are trusted. The email whitelist is a list of all email addresses that are allowed to send you mail, which is kept up to date automatically. However, you can import your address book into the email whitelist to make it easier for your contacts to verify their first email to you. The domain whitelist allows you to whitelist any message from one or more specified domains and the keyword whitelist lets any mail into your inbox that contains any word or phrase you provide. Just to make sure I don&rsquo;t miss any important mails by people or sites I know, I&rsquo;ve imported my address book, and fed a number of domain name fragments to the domain whitelist, for instance &ldquo;amazon&rdquo;, &ldquo;bloglines.com&rdquo;,\n&ldquo;bungie&rdquo;, &ldquo;dreamhost.com&rdquo; and &ldquo;ebay&rdquo;. As you can see, you don&rsquo;t have to provide full domains; allowing &ldquo;amazon&rdquo; to mail me means mails from amazon.de,\namazon.com, amazon.ca etc. go thru. You get the picture.</p>\n<p>Blacklists are the exact opposite, but they have to be treated more carefully.\nYou may configure 0Spam.com to block mail from your account if a message is from any address in the email blocklist or if it contains a word or phrase found in the keyword blocklist. It&rsquo;s not recommended to use the email blocklist to block spammers, as most spammers use email addresses that change each time they send out mail. Sometimes it <em>is</em> nice to have a blocklist, tho.\nFor instance, after receiving 20 &ldquo;security patches&rdquo; from &ldquo;Microsoft Support&rdquo; a day (I&rsquo;m talking about the Blaster worm which was sending itself across the net using supportATmicrosoftDOTcom as fake sender), I&rsquo;ve put the said mail address on the blocklist, and the mails were discarded as soon as 0Spam discovered them.</p>\n<p>So far, the service works like a charm for me. The key to leading a care-free life with 0Spam without loosing all your friends is to import your address book and to think hard about what domains should be whitelisted. Remember -\neven Amazon and Ebay are using bots to send out different types of valid mails, and these bots will not make it thru the validation. Therefore you should definitely whitelist these domains you know for certain you&rsquo;ll be receiving good mails from. I highly recommend skimming thru your mail client&rsquo;s trash folder to see which sites are &ldquo;rightfully&rdquo; mailing you periodically.</p>\n<p>The great thing about 0Spam is that it works with almost every email account on the planet. And you don&rsquo;t even have to change anything in your mail client setup, because it&rsquo;s not really sitting between you and your mailbox, it&rsquo;s more like an automated watchdog doing its rounds roughly every ten minutes,\ngrabbing everything from your mailbox that doesn&rsquo;t seem to belong there.</p>\n<p>By the way, if your mail client is always open and getting new mails from the server every minute or so, 0Spam will not work, because the mail client will most likely grab the mails before 0Spam can. Hence, the filtering will fail.\nSo it&rsquo;s recommended to make your mail client check for new messages every 30 minutes or once per hour. This might seem long, but remember, you&rsquo;re not getting that much &ldquo;good&rdquo; mails anyways &ndash; you&rsquo;re just not noticing it because of all the spam. ;)</p>\n<p>Also, once 0Spam took a peek at a mail, it&rsquo;ll be marked as read. I&rsquo;m not sure whether or not this applies to Hotmail accounts as well, but it does for my plain old vanilla POP3 account. The mails are marked as unread in my mail client after downloading them from the server, tho, so I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a problem. It sure is not for me.</p>\n<p>Alltogether I&rsquo;m very happy with 0Spam. It&rsquo;s doing a fine job. The service is running quite stable so far, even tho it&rsquo;s still in development. And even if a spam mail is making it thru the 0Spam filter because it&rsquo;s claiming to be from buyviagragoddammitATebayDOTcom - my Firebird will catch it client-side.</p>\n<p>So, if you&rsquo;re still having problems with unsolicited emails, give <a href=\"http://www.0spam.com\">0Spam</a> a whirl. The site is a bit plain, but the service is free and working. I can&rsquo;t tell you whether there are hidden drawbacks or not. Theoretically speaking,\nthere is a chance someone else&rsquo;s filter will mark the 0Spam validation mails as spam. I&rsquo;m not aware of such a case, but you&rsquo;ll never know. Also, some might argue that this type of service (whitelisters) are &ldquo;against&rdquo; the &ldquo;open character&rdquo; of email, i.e. the idea behind the medium - everyone can be reached by everyone else.

How about giving up pornography? It&rsquo;s the best present you could give your wife this year. […] But the crowning argument against pornography is the damage it does to relationships with loved ones. That is what motivates this particular column. The reason I highlight pornography here is because I keep running into it as a pastor. I keep encountering couples whose marriages have been shaken by the husband&rsquo;s secret &ndash; and, inevitably, discovered &ndash; use of pornography.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Feck, I&rsquo;m doomed. :p</p>\n<p>Yes, I am interested in porn. Not 24/7, not in every type, but sometimes it&rsquo;s kinda … nice … to have access to the biggest library of free porn on the planet, errm, I mean, to the internet. And let me tell you one thing: I think every man who claims to have never looked at porn, or claims to not find it appealing in some way (mind you, there are several levels and types of porn),\nis lying. My opinion. Porn is made by men (mostly) especially for men\n(mostly), so it&rsquo;s supposed to appeal mostly to men, on a very subtle level.\nThere&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it, if it&rsquo;s &ldquo;good&rdquo; pornography (i.e.\ndelivered in the right way for <em>your</em> subconciousness), your mind and your body will react to it. You can&rsquo;t suppress it, so why bother to try.</p>\n<p>I agree that consuming too much porn or the wrong type of porn can be dangerous to a relationship, but hell, it&rsquo;s the same with alcohol or slasher movies. Everything can be dangerous …even seemingly harmless things like fly fishing. If the husband is spending all of his spare time on the river fishing, or in front of the TV filling himself up with barrels of bad american pseudo-beer, his wife might actually leave him after a while.

				"content_text": "\nThe [Toronto Star][1] (via [Monoklon.de][2]):\n\n> \"Men, looking for the perfect Christmas present? How about giving up pornography? It's the best present you could give your wife this year. […] But the crowning argument against pornography is the damage it does to relationships with loved ones. That is what motivates this particular column. The reason I highlight pornography here is because I keep running into it as a pastor. I keep encountering couples whose marriages have been shaken by the husband's secret -- and, inevitably, discovered -- use of pornography.\"\n\nFeck, I'm doomed. :p\n\nYes, I am interested in porn. Not 24/7, not in every type, but sometimes it's kinda … nice … to have access to the biggest library of free porn on the planet, errm, I mean, to the internet. And let me tell you one thing: I think every man who claims to have never looked at porn, or claims to not find it appealing in some way (mind you, there are several levels and types of porn),\nis lying. My opinion. Porn is made by men (mostly) especially for men\n(mostly), so it's supposed to appeal mostly to men, on a very subtle level.\nThere's nothing you can do about it, if it's \"good\" pornography (i.e.\ndelivered in the right way for _your_ subconciousness), your mind and your body will react to it. You can't suppress it, so why bother to try.\n\nI agree that consuming too much porn or the wrong type of porn can be dangerous to a relationship, but hell, it's the same with alcohol or slasher movies. Everything can be dangerous …even seemingly harmless things like fly fishing. If the husband is spending all of his spare time on the river fishing, or in front of the TV filling himself up with barrels of bad american pseudo-beer, his wife might actually leave him after a while.
